item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction the following is management s assessment of certain significant factors affecting the financial condition and operating results of energy group and its subsidiaries over the past three years 
the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto contain additional data 
for the twelve months ended december   of energy group s operating revenues were derived from central hudson s electric service  from central hudson s natural gas service  and from the competitive business subsidiaries 
competition deregulation holding company restructuring energy group is the holding company parent corporation of central hudson and chec  as described under the caption subsidiaries of energy group in item of this k annual report 
energy group s operations are conducted through central hudson  chec  and the other competitive business subsidiaries 
energy group s common stock trades on the new york stock exchange under the symbol chg 
the holding company structure was instituted to permit quick response to changes in the evolving competitive energy industry 
the structure permits the use of financing techniques that are better suited to the particular requirements  characteristics  and risks of competitive operations without affecting the capital structure or creditworthiness of energy group s regulated subsidiary  central hudson 
this increases energy group s financial flexibility by allowing it to establish different capital structures for each of its individual lines of business 
refocusing of chec s business plan the purpose of the reorganization of the competitive business subsidiaries effected on december  and described herein was to streamline administration and improve managerial effectiveness 
the reorganization is not expected to have any material effect on the financial condition of energy group 
during  energy group s competitive electric generation subsidiary  ch resources  inc  was divested and certain other activities of the competitive business subsidiaries were streamlined or sold 
during  chec will continue to evaluate the long term viability of certain of its business activities  namely  cogeneration partnerships  energy efficiency projects  and its limited partnership interest in nth power technologies fund ii  lp  a venture capital fund which invests in technology companies in the energy sector 
energy group is unable to predict the outcome of this evaluation 
going forward  chec s primary focus will be on fuel distribution and related services 
in  chec s fuel distribution subsidiaries  griffith energy and scasco  will continue to explore opportunities to expand through both internal growth and acquisitions  depending on financial performance and opportunities available 
there can be no assurance that such expansion opportunities will exist  or if consummated  that they will be profitable

critical accounting policies the following accounting policies have been identified that could result in material changes to the financial condition or results of operations of energy group and its subsidiaries under different conditions or using different assumptions 
accounting for regulated operations central hudson follows generally accepted accounting principles  including the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas 
the application of this sfas may cause the allocation of costs to accounting periods to differ from accounting methods generally applied to non regulated companies 
see note under the caption regulatory accounting policies for additional discussion 
post employment benefits central hudson s reported costs of providing non contributory defined pension benefits as well as certain health care and life insurance benefits for retired employees are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future expectations 
a change in assumption regarding discount rates and expected long term rate of return on plan assets  as well as current market conditions  could cause a significant change in the level of costs to be recorded 
see note post employment benefits for additional discussion 
use of estimates preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles includes the use of estimates and assumptions by management that affect financial results and actual results may differ from those estimated 
see note under the caption use of estimates for additional discussion 
accounting for derivatives energy group and its subsidiaries use derivatives to manage their commodity and financial market risks 
the accounting requirements for derivatives and hedging activities are complex and still evolving 
all derivatives  other than those specifically excepted  are reported on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
for discussions relating to market risk and derivative instruments  see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk and note under the caption accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
capital resources and liquidity construction program central hudson as shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows  cash expenditures related to central hudson s construction program amounted to million in  a million increase from the million expended in cash construction expenditures for are estimated to be million  a decrease of million as compared to expenditures 
central hudson s estimates of construction expenditures and internal funds available for are set forth in the following table in thousands construction expenditures cash construction expenditures  less internal funds from operations  balance of construction requirements to be financed  excluding the equity portion of the allowance for funds used during construction afdc  a noncash item 
estimates of construction expenditures are subject to continuous review and adjustment  and actual expenditures may vary from these estimates 
these construction expenditures include capitalized overheads and the debt portion of afdc 
internal funds available to fund cash requirements are less than in past years because of the reduction in depreciation that occurred due to the sales of central hudson s interest in its principal generating facilities 
central hudson anticipates paying up to its entire earnings in as a dividend to energy group and may also optionally redeem million of long term securities 
in  central hudson expects to satisfy its funding requirements with available cash on hand and short term borrowings or issuances of medium term notes 
the amount of financing is not expected to exceed million in aggregate 
capital expenditures and acquisitions by ch services and chec at december   ch services had a credit facility that provided up to million to be used for working capital purposes  acquisitions  and capital expenditures  and could borrow funds from energy group 
chec has succeeded to such credit facility 
ch services capital expenditures for were approximately million  which included acquisitions of million 
chec s capital expenditures for are estimated to be million  which includes million for acquisitions  and are expected to be financed with borrowings from energy group 
the actual amount expended for acquisitions will depend on the opportunities that develop and may be higher or lower than the amount projected 
capital structure as provided in the psc s order establishing rates see note under the caption rate proceedings electric and natural gas  central hudson s common equity ratio was capped  for the purposes of the psc s return on equity roe calculation  at for the twelve months ended june   and at and  respectively  for the two subsequent twelve month periods 
it is expected that the capital structure of central hudson will allow it to maintain a strong investment grade rating during these periods 
central hudson s senior debt ratings are a by moody s investors service and a by standard and poor s corporation and fitchratings 
year end capital structure for energy group and its subsidiaries is set forth below as of the end of   and energy group year end capital structure long term debt short term debt preferred stock common equity central hudson year end capital structure long term debt short term debt preferred stock common equity competitive business subsidiaries year end capital structure long term debt short term debt preferred stock common equity based on stand alone financial statements and includes intercompany balances which are eliminated in consolidation 
financing program of energy group and its subsidiaries effective august   energy group authorized a common stock repurchase program for the purchase of up to of its then outstanding common stock over a five year period and projected that  shares would be repurchased during the first twelve months of this program 
between august and december  the number of shares repurchased under the program were  at a cost of million 
also during  energy group established an alternate investment program with the objective of realizing after tax yields on its cash reserves higher than those available through money market instruments  while avoiding undue risk to principal and maintaining adequate liquidity 
see note for further discussion of this program 
central hudson has received authority from the psc to issue up to million of unsecured medium term notes during the three years ending june  during  million of such notes were issued and million of such notes remain authorized but unissued 
for more information with respect to the financing program of energy group  see notes and griffith energy  one of the competitive business subsidiaries and a subsidiary of chec  funded its acquisitions in with funds received from energy group 
short term debt as more fully discussed in note  central hudson  pursuant to authority from the psc  entered into a million revolving credit facility in october to replace its then existing million revolving credit facility 
in addition  central hudson maintains a confirmed line of credit of million with a regional bank and certain uncommitted lines of credit with various banks 
these agreements give central hudson competitive options to minimize the cost of its short term borrowing 
authorization from the psc limits the amount central hudson may have outstanding at any time under all of its short term borrowing arrangements to million in the aggregate 
this authorization expires on june as of december   the competitive business subsidiaries also have a short term line of credit totaling million 
parental guarantees for information on parental guarantees issued by energy group and certain of its competitive subsidiaries  see note under the caption parental guarantees 
product warranties for information on product warranties issued by certain of energy group s competitive subsidiaries  see note under the caption product warranties 
results of operations the following discussion and analyses include explanations of significant changes in revenues and expenses between results and results and between results and results for both energy group and central hudson 
additional information relating to changes between these years is provided in the notes 
earnings earnings per share of energy group s common stock are shown after provision for dividends on central hudson s preferred stock and are computed on the basis of the average number of common shares outstanding during the subject year 
the number of shares of energy group common stock  the earnings per share  and the rate of return earned on average common equity are as follows average shares outstanding s 
   earnings per share basic and diluted return earned on common equity per financial statements earnings per share for  basic and diluted  were as compared to for  a decrease of per share 
the decrease in earnings resulted largely from the effect of regulatory actions taken in in conjunction with the sale of central hudson s interests in its principal generating facilities 
these actions included the recognition of tax benefits in  a reduction in rate base related to the sale of central hudson s interests in the principal generating facilities  and an after tax contribution to central hudson s customer benefit fund in described in note under the captions summary of regulatory assets and liabilities and rate proceedings electric and natural gas 
the reduction in earnings also reflects a decrease in interest and investment income due to lower cash balances and rates of return  an increase in other operating expenses for central hudson  primarily storm restoration costs due to increased storm activity in  and a decrease in central hudson s natural gas net operating revenues net of the cost of natural gas and revenue taxes resulting from lower sales due to milder weather 
the reduction in earnings per share was partially offset by an increase in central hudson s electric net operating revenues net of the cost of purchased electricity  fuel used in the generation of electricity  and revenue taxes  reductions in central hudson s interest charges and preferred stock dividends  and an enhancement in earnings from a non recurring item recorded by central hudson 
the increase in electric net operating revenues results primarily from increased sales  due in part to hotter weather during the summer months in interest charges and preferred stock dividends were reduced due to the redemption or repurchase of various long term debt and preferred stock issues in and using proceeds from the sale of central hudson s principal interests in its principal generating facilities 
the non recurring item is income that was recorded by central hudson for the receipt and subsequent sale of stock related to the demutualization of certain insurance companies through which central hudson provided employee benefits 
energy group s earnings were also enhanced by an increase in earnings from ch services  largely attributable to discontinued operations described in note under the caption discontinued operations 
a net gain was realized for the may sale of ch resources  ch services wholly owned electric generation subsidiary 
this gain was partially offset by one time charges related to restructuring certain energy efficiency contracts and lower earnings from sales by its fuel distribution subsidiaries 
earnings increased 
per share in basic and diluted when compared to basic and diluted 
this increase resulted substantially from an increase in central hudson s electric net operating revenues net of cost of purchased electricity  fuel used in the generation of electricity  and revenue taxes due primarily to a increase in own territory sales to residential and commercial customers 
this increase in sales for the year resulted from an increase in the average number of customers and warmer weather during the summer months 
the number of cooling degree days in was higher than and above normal 
the increase in central hudson s net operating revenues was partially offset by a reduction in profits permitted by the psc to be retained from sales of electricity to other utilities and marketers due to the termination of this regulatory incentive in early also contributing to the increase in earnings was an increase in central hudson s gas net operating revenues net of the cost of natural gas and revenue taxes primarily due to an increase in residential and commercial space heating sales  and an increase in the average number of customers 
earnings were also favorably impacted by energy group s favorable annualization effect in of the common stock repurchase program in and the recognition of gains by energy group related to weather derivative contracts 
central hudson s earnings were also favorably impacted by the net effect of various items including cost of capital  income taxes  and operating expenses 
partially offsetting the increase in central hudson s earnings was the net effect on central hudson of regulatory actions in associated with the sales of central hudson s interests in its principal generating facilities 
these regulatory actions included a reduction in rate base related to those generating facilities  an after tax contribution to central hudson s customer benefit fund described in note under the caption summary of regulatory assets and liabilities customer benefit fund  recognition of tax benefits related to the sale of those generating facilities  and recognition of net income for shareholders under a prior regulatory agreement 
also offsetting the increase in earnings was a reduction in earnings from ch services  due primarily to losses incurred by ch resources prior to its sale  as a result of reduced margins attributable to volatile natural gas prices and lower than expected wholesale electricity prices 
milder weather also depressed sales of ch services fuel distribution subsidiaries 
this reduction in ch services earnings was partly offset by gains recorded by ch services related to weather derivative contracts entered into as hedges against variations in heating degree days 
operating revenues total operating revenues of energy group decreased million  or  in as compared to  and decreased million  or  in as compared to see the table below for details of the variations increase or decrease from prior year electric gas other total electric gas other total operating revenues in thousands customer sales       sales to other utilities       fuel cost adjustment 
      deferred revenues       miscellaneous subtotal      competitive business subsidiary sales     total        note the reduction in revenues from electric sales due to customer refunds is offset by the restoration of revenues from central hudson s customer benefit fund see note 
sales central hudson central hudson s revenues vary seasonally in response to weather 
in particular  electric revenues peak in the summer while natural gas revenues peak in the winter 
for  sales of electricity to full service customers  plus delivery of electricity supplied by others  increased as compared to sales to residential customers increased and sales to commercial customers increased reflecting  in part  an increase in electricity usage due to hotter summer weather in cooling degree days in were higher than in sales to industrial customers increased  reflecting  in substantial part  a significant increase in usage by a single large industrial customer 
for  sales of firm natural gas  plus transportation of natural gas supplied by others  decreased as compared to the prior year 
residential sales decreased while sales to commercial customers decreased 
such sales  comprised largely of sales for heating  decreased primarily as a result of milder weather as heating degree days in were lower than in industrial sales  representing approximately of total uninterruptible sales in and  decreased while interruptible sales increased 
sales of electricity  plus delivery of electricity supplied by others  increased in compared to sales to residential and commercial customers increased and  respectively  while sales to industrial customers were unchanged 
the increase in sales was due primarily to an increase in the average number of residential and commercial customers and increased usage due to warmer than normal weather 
cooling degree days in were higher than in and above normal 
sales of uninterruptible natural gas  plus transportation of natural gas supplied by others  decreased by from to  however  sales to residential and commercial customers each increased 
the increase in sales to these customers resulted primarily from an increase in the average number of customers 
industrial sales decreased and interruptible sales decreased as compared to the prior year due to a decrease in usage 
changes in sales from the prior year by major customer classification  including interruptible natural gas sales are set forth below 
also included are the changes related to electricity delivery 
increase decrease from prior year electric mwh natural gas mcf residential commercial industrial interruptible n a n a because of sharing arrangements established for interruptible natural gas sales and interruptible transportation of customer owned natural gas  as described under the caption incentive arrangements below  variations in these sales from year to year typically have a minimal impact on earnings 
incentive arrangements under certain earnings sharing formulas approved by the psc  central hudson either shares with its customers certain revenues and or cost savings exceeding predetermined levels  or is penalized in some cases for shortfalls from certain performance standards 
earnings sharing formulas are currently effective for interruptible natural gas sales  natural gas capacity release transactions  natural gas reliability  electric service reliability  and certain aspects of customer service and satisfaction 
see note under the caption rate proceedings electric and natural gas for a description of earnings sharing formulas approved by the psc for central hudson 
the net results of these and previous earnings sharing formulas were to increase pretax earnings by million  million and million during  and  respectively 
sales and revenues competitive business subsidiaries revenues for ch services decreased from in to million in the reduction in revenues reflects  in substantial part  the impact of the sale of ch resources  which was sold in may revenues and expenses for ch resources were eliminated from the results of continuing operations beginning december in accordance with accounting principles relating to discontinued operations 
ch resources cumulative net operating loss and the gain on its sale are reported separately from the results of continuing operations in energy group s consolidated income statement 
the overall decrease in revenues was partially offset by revenues from increased sales of petroleum products due to acquisitions of fuel distribution companies in the latter part of revenues for ch services increased million  from million in to million in of the revenue increase in  revenues from griffith energy increased million from million in to million in  primarily due to the full year of ownership of griffith energy 
revenues from scasco increased million  from million in to million in  primarily due to a growth in sales resulting from acquisitions 
sales of wholesale electricity by ch resources during decreased by million from million in due to reduced wholesale electric prices in new york state 
sales in  sales of petroleum products increased by million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in this increase was the result of acquisitions 
in  sales of natural gas increased by  mcf  or  to million mcf from million mcf in this increase was due to customer growth 
in  sales of petroleum products increased by million gallons  or  to million gallons from million gallons in this increase was due to the full year of ownership of griffith energy in in  sales of natural gas increased by  mcf  or  to million mcf from million mcf in this increase was due to customer growth 
revenues in  revenues from petroleum products increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase was the result of increased sales volumes as a result of acquisitions 
in  natural gas revenues increased by million  or  to million from million in this increase was due to increased sales volume 
in  revenues from petroleum products increased by million  or  to million from million for this increase was the result of increased sales volumes as a result of a full year of ownership of griffith energy in in  natural gas revenues decreased by million  or  to million from million in this decrease was due to reduced retail prices as a result of lower commodity costs in operating expenses central hudson the most significant elements of operating expenses are purchased electricity and purchased natural gas 
approximately in and in of every revenue dollar related to sales of electricity was expended for the combined cost of fuel used in electric generation and purchased electricity 
the corresponding figures for the cost of purchased natural gas were and  respectively 
central hudson negotiated multi year electricity purchase contracts with the new owners of the principal generating facilities it divested 
these purchases are supplemented by purchases from the nys iso 
for information regarding these electricity purchase contracts  see item of this k annual report under the subcaption load and capacity  note under the caption sales of principal generating facilities and note operating expenses increased million  or  from million in to million in purchased electricity and fuel used in electric generation increased by million  primarily as a result of the sale of central hudson s interests in its principal generating facilities in january and november of purchased electricity costs for reflect the purchase of substantially all of central hudson s energy requirements compared to in the increase in electric sales also contributed to the increase in these costs 
partially offsetting the increase in operating expenses is the elimination of operating costs for central hudson s principal generating facilities and a reduction in purchased natural gas costs reflecting both lower commodity prices and a reduction in sales 
total central hudson utility operating expenses decreased million  or from to the reduction in these expenses largely reflected the effect of the sale of central hudson s interests in its principal generating facilities 
fuel and purchased electricity for central hudson increased  or  in compared to due to an increase in sales to full service residential and commercial customers 
in  central hudson s utility fuel and purchased electricity increased million  or  due to increases in electric sales and sales of electricity for resale 
the rise in costs reflected both increasing fossil fuel prices and the impact of changing market conditions brought about by the formation of the nys iso in november during  central hudson s purchased natural gas costs remained almost flat with an increase of  or  reflecting an increase in the volume of natural gas purchased 
in  purchased natural gas costs increased million  or  due to higher firm and interruptible natural gas sales  including the use of natural gas as a boiler fuel 
all other expenses decreased million due to a reduction in depreciation  amortization  taxes  and other expenses associated with the sales of central hudson s interests in the danskammer plant and the roseton plant and the reduction in depreciation expense for central hudson s interest in the nine mile plant 
operating expenses ch services operating expenses for ch services decreased million  from million in to million in  largely as a result of the sale of ch resources 
this decrease was partially offset by increased operating expenses due to additional acquisitions of fuel distribution companies 
the cost of purchased petroleum products increased by million  or  to million from million in from increased sales due to acquisitions of fuel distribution companies 
the cost of natural gas increased by million  or  to million from million in due to an increase in sales 
ch services operating expenses increased million from million in to million in  primarily due to fuel costs associated with ch resources generating plants and the cost of purchased petroleum products and natural gas for scasco and griffith energy 
in  the cost of petroleum products increased by million  or  to million from million in the increase was primarily due to the full year of ownership of griffith energy 
in  the cost of natural gas increased by million  or  to million from million for the increase was due to increased sales volume 
fuel costs for ch resources decreased from million in to million in due to decreased electric generation 
ch services other operating expenses  excluding energy supply costs  increased million  including a million increase in depreciation and amortization on related assets 
the primary reasons for both the increase in energy supply costs and the increase in other expenses of operation are the full year ownership of griffith energy  and the additional acquisitions in see note for an analysis and reconciliation of federal and state income taxes 
other income and interest charges in  energy group s other income and deductions decreased million as compared to primarily reflecting the net effect of favorable tax benefits related to the sale of central hudson s interests in its principal generating facilities and the after tax contribution to central hudson s customer benefit fund  both recorded in the reduction also reflects a decrease in interest and investment income 
interest charges and preferred stock dividends decreased million in due primarily to redemptions and repurchases of various long term debt and preferred stock issues by central hudson in and utilizing proceeds from the sale of central hudson s interests in its principal generating facilities 
energy group s other income and deductions increased million in as compared to  resulting largely from the recognition of tax benefits related to the sales of central hudson s interests in its principal generating facilities and the restoration of net income for central hudson shareholders under a prior regulatory agreement 
the increase also reflects the recognition of gains related to weather derivative contracts entered into by energy group to hedge the effect of weather patterns on its subsidiaries operations 
energy group s total interest charges excluding afdc decreased million  or  in  primarily due to the redemption and repurchase of its long term debt obligations by central hudson 
this debt was eliminated using a portion of the proceeds from the sale of central hudson s interests in its principal generating facilities 
partially offsetting the decrease in interest charges were central hudson s carrying charges related to a number of regulatory obligations  including the customer benefit fund 
the following table sets forth some of the pertinent data on energy group s outstanding debt unless noted otherwise  this debt relates to central hudson in thousands long term debt debt retired    outstanding at year end amount including current portion    effective rate short term debt average daily amount outstanding    weighted average interest rate

in making future dividend decisions  energy group will evaluate all circumstances at the time of making such decisions  including business  financial and regulatory considerations 
the agreement contains certain dividend payment restrictions on central hudson  including limitations on the amount of dividends payable if central hudson s senior debt ratings are downgraded by more than one rating agency due to performance or concerns about the financial condition of energy group or any energy group subsidiary other than central hudson 
these limitations would result in the average annual income available for dividends on a two year rolling average basis being reduced to i  if the downgrade were below bbb  ii if the senior debt were placed on credit watch or the equivalent because of a rating below bbb  or iii no dividends payable if the downgrade were below bbb 
these restrictions survive the june  expiration of the agreement 
central hudson is currently rated a or equivalent and the restrictions noted above do not apply 
the number of registered holders of common stock of energy group as of december   was  of these   were accounts in the names of individuals with total holdings of  shares  or an average of shares per account 
the other accounts  in the names of institutional or other non individual holders  for the most part hold shares of common stock for the benefit of individuals 
all of the outstanding common stock of central hudson and the competitive business subsidiaries is held by energy group 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary market risks for energy group and its subsidiaries are commodity price risk and interest rate risk 
commodity price risk  related primarily to purchases of natural gas  electricity and petroleum products for resale  is mitigated in several different ways 
under the agreement  central hudson may collect its actual purchased electricity and natural gas costs through automatic adjustment clauses to its tariff rates 
these adjustment clauses provide for the collection of costs  including risk management costs from customers to reflect the actual costs incurred in obtaining supply 
risk management costs are defined by the psc as costs associated with transactions that are intended to reduce price volatility or reduce overall costs to customers 
these costs include transaction costs  and gains and losses associated with risk management instruments 
ch services fuel distribution companies may increase the prices charged for the commodities they sell in response to changes in costs  however  the ability to raise prices is limited by the competitive market 
depending on market conditions  central hudson and certain of the competitive business subsidiaries enter into long term fixed supply and long term forward supply contracts for the purchase of these commodities 
central hudson also uses natural gas storage facilities which enable it to purchase and hold quantities of natural gas at pre heating season prices for use during the heating season 
in addition  central hudson and certain of the competitive business subsidiaries enter into derivative transactions to hedge market price fluctuations 
ch services now chec and central hudson have in place a common energy risk management program to manage  through the use of defined risk management practices  price and volume risks associated with commodity purchases in their respective operations 
this program permits the use of derivative financial instruments to hedge price risk 
both central hudson and ch services now chec have entered into either exchange traded futures contracts or over the counter otc contracts with third parties to hedge commodity price risk associated with the purchase of natural gas  electricity and petroleum products 
central hudson hedges portions of its total electric and natural gas supply requirements and the purchase of electricity with derivative contracts 
the fair value of open positions at december  was million  and a total of  in net gains was recognized in  as compared to a fair value of million at december   and million of net gains was recognized for these gains served to offset the differences between the expected price of the commodity and the actual price 
central hudson manages its interest rate risk through the issuance of fixed rate debt with varying maturities and variable rate debt for which interest is reset on a periodic basis to reflect current market conditions 
the difference between costs associated with actual variable interest rates related to central hudson s bonds issued by the new york state energy research development authority nyserda and costs embedded in customer rates is deferred for eventual refund to  or recovery from  customers 
the variability in interest rates is also managed with an interest rate cap agreement  for which the premium cost and any realized benefits also pass through the aforementioned regulatory mechanism 
central hudson also repurchases or redeems existing debt at a lower cost when market conditions permit 
ch services now chec also enters into derivative transactions to hedge purchases of heating oil and natural gas 
the fair values of open positions at december  and at december  were not material 
realized net gains on these derivative transactions in were not material 
in  a net gain of million was realized for such derivatives  which served to offset the difference between the expected price of the commodity purchased or sold and the actual price 
the large decrease in gains is attributable to derivatives that hedge commodity transactions for operations that were discontinued effective december  ch services derivative balance of million at december  also included million of derivatives related to those discontinued operations 
in order to hedge weather related sales volume risk  energy group and certain of its subsidiaries have also entered into weather derivative contracts known as costless collars to hedge the effect on earnings due to significant variations in weather conditions from normal patterns and to reduce exposure to variations in heating and cooling degree days 
for weather derivative contracts covering the heating and cooling seasons  a total net loss of  was recorded in as compared to a net gain of million for similar contracts in in accordance with energy group s and central hudson s risk management policy and procedures  otc derivative transactions are entered into only with counter parties that meet certain credit criteria 
the creditworthiness of these counter parties is determined primarily by reference to published credit ratings 
at december   central hudson had open derivative contracts to hedge natural gas prices through october  covering approximately of central hudson s projected total natural gas requirements during that period 
in  derivative transactions were used to hedge of central hudson s total natural gas supply requirements as compared to in in its electric operations  central hudson had open derivatives at december   hedging approximately of its required electricity supply through august in  central hudson hedged approximately of its total electricity supply requirements with otc derivative contracts 
in addition  central hudson has multi year transition agreements to purchase electricity  at fixed prices  produced by its former principal generating facilities 
the notional amounts hedged by the derivatives and the purchase electricity agreements for and represent approximately and  respectively 
at december   ch services now chec s subsidiaries  griffith energy and scasco  had open otc put and call option positions with counter parties extending through april  covering approximately of the anticipated fuel oil supply requirements for the period january through april griffith energy and scasco generally enter into heating oil put derivative contracts to hedge firm heating oil purchase commitments and in began to enter into call option purchases to cover their heating oil supply requirements for fixed and capped price programs not hedged by firm contracts to protect against commodity price increases or supply restrictions resulting from colder than normal weather 
derivative contracts are discussed in more detail in note under the caption accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities
