item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general cheniere is engaged in oil and gas exploration  development and exploitation and in the development of an lng receiving terminal business 
the company has historically focused on evaluating and generating drilling prospects using a regional and integrated approach with a large seismic database as a platform 
the company is currently focusing  and expects to continue to focus  its attention and resources on the development of its lng receiving terminal business 
cheniere s management expects that the company s active interpretation of d seismic data and generation of prospects will continue  through its participation in the drilling of wells will be accomplished through farmout arrangements and back in interests  whereby the capital costs are borne by industry partners 
production and product prices information concerning the company s production and average prices received for the years ended december   and is presented in the following table 
year ended december  production oil bbls   gas mcf    gas equivalents mcfe    average sales prices oil per bbl gas per mcf results of operations comparison of the fiscal years ended december  and the company s financial results for the year ended december  reflect a loss of  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a loss of  or per share basic and diluted in the major factors contributing to the company s loss in were general and administrative expenses of  and equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliate of  including accrued dividend obligations totaling  for the year  payable by gryphon  related to its preferred stock 
oil and gas revenues decreased to  in from  in as a result of decreased production volumes  mcfe in compared with  mcfe in 
the decline in production volumes primarily results from the sale of the company s two producing wells at west cameron block in april adding to the effect of declining production was a decrease in average gas prices to per mcf in compared to per mcf in the prior year 
production costs decreased to  in from  in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a decreased to  in from  in as a result of both the decline in the company s production volumes  described above  and a lower dd a rate per unit per mcfe versus per mcfe 
the company s dd a rate has declined due to its change in emphasis toward selling prospects for front end fees plus carried interests  as opposed to direct participation in drilling costs  and due to the effect of ceiling test write downs recorded in gross general and administrative g a expenses totaled  in  compared to  in the most significant component of the increase between years was in consulting fees  which increased by  to  in  compared to  in the increased consulting expense in principally related to permitting  environmental and regulatory work related to the lng receiving terminals project 
offsetting total g a expenses were amounts capitalized to the company s oil and gas properties and recoveries of lng related expenses in connection with the sale of cheniere s freeport lng terminal project 
cheniere capitalizes as oil and gas property costs that portion of g a expenses directly related to its exploration and development activities 
cheniere capitalized  in compared to  in in connection with cheniere s sale of its freeport lng project to development  cheniere was reimbursed  related to g a expenses incurred on the project subsequent to june  g a expenses  net of amounts capitalized and recoveries  were  and  in and  respectively 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate for includes cheniere s equity share of gryphon s losses of  calculated by applying cheniere s common stock ownership interest to gryphon s net loss of  reducing such result for gryphon s preferred dividend arrearages of  for the year and limiting the cumulative amount of net loss recognized to the balance of cheniere s investment in gryphon 
during  cheniere s basis of its investment in gryphon was reduced to zero  but not below zero  because cheniere does not guarantee any obligations of gryphon and is not committed to provide additional financial support to gryphon 
the amount of gryphon s net loss that has not yet been recorded by cheniere was  at december  cheniere s equity share of gryphon s losses for was  calculated by applying cheniere s common stock ownership interest to gryphon s net income of  and reducing such result for gryphon s preferred dividend arrearages of  at such time as warburg converts its preferred shares to common shares  cheniere s equity share of gryphon s earnings will be calculated at based on ownership interests outstanding at december  results of operations comparison of the fiscal years ended december  and the company s financial results for the year ended december  reflect a loss of  or per share basic and diluted  compared to a loss of  or per share basic and diluted in the major factors contributing to the company s loss in were  in ceiling test write downs  general and administrative expenses of  and equity in loss of unconsolidated affiliate of  including accrued dividend obligations totaling  for the year  payable by gryphon  related to its preferred stock 
oil and gas revenues decreased to  in from  in as a result of decreased production volumes  mcfe in compared with  mcfe in 
the decline in production volumes represents normal depletion of currently producing zones for the company s two producing wells at west cameron block the effect of declining production was partially offset by an increase in average gas prices to per mcf in compared to per mcf in the prior year 
production costs increased to  in from  in depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a decreased to  in from  in as a result of both a lower dd a rate per unit per mcfe versus per mcfe and the decline in the company s production volumes 
gross general and administrative g a expenses totaled  in  compared to  in the most significant component of the increase between years was in legal fees  which increased by  to  in compared to  in the increased legal expenses in include approximately  related to the company s development of an lng receiving terminal business and approximately  related to cheniere s buyout of its partner s interest in the proprietary cameron d seismic data set 
also affecting the net g a expenses reported between the years were reduced recoveries from management fees and reduced amounts capitalized as oil and gas property costs 
in  cheniere received management fees from an industry partner in the amount of  of which  was recorded as a recovery of g a expenses 
the exploration agreement under which these management fees were received was assigned to gryphon in october cheniere received no management fees in cheniere capitalizes as oil and gas property costs that portion of g a expenses directly related to its exploration and development activities 
cheniere capitalized  in compared to  in  the change being a direct result of the decreased level of exploration activity following the gryphon transaction in october g a expenses  net of recoveries and amounts capitalized  were  and  in and  respectively 
equity in net loss of unconsolidated affiliate for includes cheniere s equity share of gryphon s losses of  calculated by applying cheniere s common stock ownership interest to gryphon s net income of  and reducing such result for gryphon s preferred dividend arrearages of  for the year 
cheniere s equity share of gryphon s losses for the period from october  through december  was  calculated by applying cheniere s common stock ownership interest to gryphon s net income of  and reducing such result for gryphon s preferred dividend arrearages of  at such time as warburg converts its preferred shares to common shares  cheniere s equity share of gryphon s earnings will be calculated at based on ownership interests outstanding at december liquidity and capital resources management expects that the company will meet all of its liquidity requirements for the next twelve months through a combination of cash balances  collection of receivables and cash flows from current operations 
such sources are not expected to be adequate to meet future liquidity requirements as the company expands its lng terminal business 
the company expects that future liquidity requirements will be met by one or more of the following the divestiture of producing oil and gas properties  sales of portions of its working interest in the prospects within its exploration program  sale to an industry partner of a participation in the company s exploration program  sale of a participation interest in the company s lng projects and or additional offerings of the company s debt or equity securities 
in the event that the company is unable to obtain additional capital from one or more of these sources  its operations could be adversely affected 
at december   cheniere had a working capital deficit of  a significant portion of this deficit  a  note payable  was canceled in march  without requiring the use of cash by the company  when cheniere sold an interest in its freeport lng project 
additionally  approximately  included in accrued liabilities will be satisfied through the issuance of warrants rather than the expenditure of cash 
cash flow from operating activities net cash used in operations for the year ended december  totaled  compared to net cash used in operations of  in in april  the company sold its west cameron block producing oil and gas properties 
throughout the remainder of  cheniere generated and sold new prospects  retaining overriding royalty interests which revert to larger working interests after payout of the prospects 
revenues from this program are expected to be approximately  per month by the end of private placements of equity since its inception  cheniere s primary source of financing for operating expenses and investments in its exploration program has been the sale of its equity securities 
through december   the company has issued  shares of its common stock  generating net proceeds of  no equity securities were sold by the company in during  the company raised  net of offering costs  from the sale of units common stock and warrants to accredited investors pursuant to regulation d 
proceeds of the offering were used for the acquisition of leases and other exploration costs and for general corporate purposes 
in february  the company issued to one stockholder  units at a cash purchase price of per unit for an aggregate offering price of  each unit consisting of one share of common stock  
par value per share  and one warrant to purchase one sixth of a share of common stock 
warrants issued in connection with this sale of units are exercisable at a price of per share on or before december  these units were sold pursuant to offers made exclusively to accredited investors  in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by section of regulation d 
no underwriting discounts or commissions were made with respect to the offering 
proceeds of the offering  net of offering costs  were  the purchaser of the shares of common stock issued in this private placement was granted certain registration rights 
in may  as compensation for assistance in the company s listing on the american stock exchange  cheniere issued to a consultant warrants to purchase  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  exercisable on or before april  the issuance was made to one consultant without any advertising or solicitation 
this issuance was made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by section of the securities act of in june  cheniere issued  shares of common stock to crest financial ltd

the stock was valued at the closing market price on the date of the transaction  per share  for an aggregate transaction value of  the stock was issued as part of the consideration pursuant to an agreement resolving certain disputes between crest financial ltd 
and cheniere 
based on the fact that the issuance was made to a single person without any advertisement or solicitation  this issuance was made in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by section of the securities act of in connection with the sale of the company s proved oil and gas properties  cheniere issued warrants to purchase  shares of cheniere common stock to a consultant valued at  the company issued warrants to purchase  shares of cheniere common stock and extended the expiration period on existing warrants to purchase  shares of cheniere common stock  all at a value of  in connection with a short term bridge financing arrangement with an unrelated third party lender 
cheniere issued warrants to purchase  shares of cheniere common stock to a consultant valued at  for assistance in marketing the company s lng terminal 
the company issued  stock options valued at  to a consultant for assistance in developing the lng terminal business 
cheniere issued warrants to purchase  shares of cheniere common stock to an investor relations consultant valued at  the warrant issuances were made without any advertising or solicitation  in reliance on the exemption from registration provided by section of the securities act of short term promissory notes at december   cheniere had no outstanding debt obligations 
in march  the company entered into a short term bridge financing arrangement with an unrelated third party lender 
the amount of the borrowing was  the term was days 
interest was payable monthly at per annum 
warrants were issued to the lender for the purchase of  shares of cheniere common stock  exercisable at a price of per share on or before march  additionally  cheniere extended the term to march  on existing warrants for the purchase of  shares held by parties affiliated with the lender 
based on the black scholes model  the warrants issued  shares and the extension of existing warrants  shares in connection with this financing arrangement have an aggregate value of  debt discount of  was recorded based on the relative fair values of the note payable and the warrants 
an additional  warrants were required to be issued to the lender for each month or partial month for which the principal remained unpaid after april  the company repaid the loan on april   resulting in a loss on early extinguishment of debt in the amount of  which is classified as an ordinary loss in the company s statement of operations 
cheniere also issued an additional  warrants to the lender  valued at  based on the black scholes model 
in june  cheniere received  as a refundable payment for the sale of two options to purchase an aggregate of up to a interest in its freeport lng receiving terminal project 
in the event the first option is exercised  the payment is applied to the purchase price 
in the event the option is not exercised  the payment is refundable  and repayment is secured by a note payable executed by cheniere 
the note is payable in full on july  it will bear interest at  payable at maturity and accruing from the earlier of the time the option expires or the date the holder elects not to exercise 
as of december   the note has not yet begun to bear interest 
the note is secured by cheniere s revenues  accounts receivable and other assets 
on march   the option for a interest in the freeport project was exercised  cheniere s note payable was canceled and the collateral was released 
exploration funding on october   cheniere completed a transaction with warburg to fund its exploration program on approximately  square miles of seismic data in the gulf of mexico the louisiana data set through a newly formed affiliated company  gryphon 
cheniere contributed selected assets and liabilities in exchange for of the common stock of gryphon effective interest after conversion of preferred stock and  in cash 
such assets included the louisiana data set  certain offshore leases  a prospect then being drilled  its exploration agreement with an industry partner and certain other assets and liabilities 
the net book value of the assets and liabilities contributed was  which consisted of assets of  primarily unproved oil and gas properties and liabilities of  primarily accounts payable 
warburg contributed  and received preferred stock  with an cumulative dividend  convertible into of gryphon s common stock 
cheniere and warburg also have the option  in connection with subsequent capital calls made by gryphon  to contribute up to an additional  to gryphon  proportionate to their respective ownership interests 
under the terms of the agreement governing these additional contributions  in the event that either cheniere or warburg elects not to participate in any additional contribution  the other investor has the option to purchase the non participating investor s proportionate share 
assuming i that gryphon makes subsequent capital calls for an aggregate of  ii that cheniere elects not to participate in any of the capital calls and iii that warburg elects to purchase all of cheniere s proportionate share  and giving effect to cheniere s sale to gryphon of  shares of gryphon common stock in july and its sale to gryphon of  shares of gryphon common stock in march  the company s effective interest in gryphon  after giving effect to the conversion of gryphon s preferred stock  will be reduced to 
cheniere accounted for the contribution of net assets at its historical cost  whereby the net amount of such assets and liabilities less the  in cash was reclassified to investment in unconsolidated affiliate 
no gain or loss was recognized at the time of contribution 
during and  gryphon made cash calls totaling  against its capital commitment of  cheniere declined to participate in such cash calls  and warburg elected to purchase all of cheniere s proportionate share of such cash calls 
also during  cheniere transferred  shares of gryphon common stock to gryphon in connection with the sale of licenses to certain seismic data 
in march  cheniere sold  shares of its gryphon common stock to gryphon 
as a result of these transactions  cheniere s ownership interest in gryphon  after the effect of converting preferred stock into common stock  was reduced from at december  to as of december  in connection with the seismic license contributed to gryphon upon its formation  cheniere entered into an agreement with the third party issuer of the license 
the agreement provided that cheniere would pay a transfer fee to the third party in an aggregate amount of up to  such transfer fee was contingent upon gryphon s completion of up to ten successful wells during the license period and within the license area 
cheniere s existing and contingent obligations under this agreement were fully discharged in march in connection with its sale of  shares of gryphon common stock to gryphon and the related assumption by gryphon of these obligations 
gryphon also assumed  of cheniere s contingent liabilities related to the future reprocessing of certain d seismic data 
cheniere accounts for its investment in gryphon using the equity method of accounting 
although cheniere s participation on the gryphon board of directors provides significant influence over the operating and financial policies of gryphon  cheniere does not participate in the day to day management of gryphon  does not exercise control over gryphon and cannot effect a change in the management of gryphon 
cheniere s equity share of gryphon s losses for was  calculated by applying cheniere s common stock ownership interest to gryphon s net loss of  reducing such result for gryphon s preferred dividend arrearages of  for the year and limiting the cumulative amount of net loss recognized to the balance of cheniere s investment in gryphon 
during  cheniere s basis of its investment in gryphon was reduced to zero  but not below zero  because cheniere does not guarantee any obligations of gryphon and is not committed to provide additional financial support to gryphon 
the amount of gryphon s net loss that has not yet been recorded by cheniere was  at december  seismic reprocessing between june and october  cheniere acquired licenses to approximately  miles of seismic data primarily in the shallow waters offshore texas and also in the west cameron area in the gulf of mexico the offshore texas project area in separate transactions with seitel data ltd  a division of seitel inc  and jebco seismic  lp cheniere committed to reprocess all of the data from the offshore texas project area at a cost of approximately  payable in installments beginning in october and continuing through the final delivery of reprocessed data  which is expected to occur in deliveries of reprocessed data began in may after the assumption of liabilities by gryphon related to its purchase in of one license to the data discussed below  and related to the march sale of  shares of its gryphon common stock back to gryphon  cheniere has no existing or contingent liability related to seismic reprocessing as of december  sale of licenses to seismic data in june and july  cheniere sold licenses to  square miles of seismic data to gryphon for  cash proceeds to cheniere were  gryphon also assumed  of cheniere s obligation to fund the reprocessing of the seismic data 
in connection with the transaction  cheniere also transferred  shares of gryphon common stock to gryphon 
cheniere retains one license to all of the data in the offshore texas project area 
sale of proprietary seismic data in september  cheniere acquired for  all rights to its square mile proprietary seismic database from the industry partner with whom it had jointly acquired the data in and cheniere subsequently sold the seismic data to a seismic marketing company for  and a share in licensing proceeds generated by the marketing company 
in september  cheniere sold its remaining interest in future licensing proceeds to the marketing company for  proceeds from the september and sales of d seismic data were recorded as a reduction to the company s unproved oil and gas property costs 
cheniere retains a license to all of the seismic data for use in its exploration program 
sale of interest in freeport  texas lng terminal in august  cheniere entered into an agreement with entities controlled by michael s 
smith to sell a interest in its planned lng receiving facility at freeport  texas 
in february  cheniere s freeport lng project was acquired by freeport lng development  lp freeport lng  in which cheniere retained a interest 
freeport lng will pay cheniere  in cash and will spend up to  to obtain permits and prepare the project for the construction phase with no further contribution by cheniere 
after contribution of the full  additional expenses will be borne by the parties pro rata based on their respective ownership interests 
smith  through a controlled entity  freeport lng investments  llc investments  holds a interest in freeport lng 
smith will manage the project as chief executive officer of freeport lng 
the cash payments to cheniere are payable  at closing   on july  and october   and  days after all construction permits are obtained for the freeport site 
with the signing of a definitive lease agreement for the freeport  texas terminal site on december   freeport lng paid to cheniere  for related costs and expenses  which amount would have been reimbursable by cheniere should the sale to freeport lng not have been completed 
furthermore  at closing on february   freeport lng paid cheniere  in cash and assumed cheniere liabilities of  related to freeport lng project costs 
these payments and assumptions of liabilities represent an aggregate of  in project cost recoveries to cheniere  in addition to the  initial installment payment received at closing 
on march   cheniere sold a interest in freeport lng to a third party for  payable over time 
cheniere retained a interest in freeport lng 
corpus christi  texas lng terminal funding negotiations in december  cheniere entered into a non binding memorandum of understanding with sherwin providing for the negotiation of a partnership agreement which would grant sherwin a interest in cheniere s corpus christi receiving terminal project in exchange for sherwin s agreement to fund the first  in project development costs 
completion of the partnership agreement is scheduled to occur by april  in the event that such an agreement is not consummated by that date  sherwin will grant to cheniere a lease option on the terminal site lands in corpus christi 
the option rentals will be  per year for up to years 
upon exercise of the option  lease rentals would be  per year for an initial term of years  renewable for two additional terms of years each 
contractual cash obligations cheniere is committed to making cash payments in the future on certain of its contracts 
the company has no off balance sheet debt or other such unrecorded obligations and cheniere has not guaranteed the debt of any other party 
below is a schedule of the future payments that cheniere was obligated to make based on agreements in place as of december  payments due for years ended december  total beyond operating leases    lng consulting retainer    note payable   a discussion of operating leases can be found in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
cheniere has no capital leases 
in april  the company engaged research consultants in connection with the development of its lng receiving terminal business 
in connection with the february closing on the sale of the freeport  texas lng terminal described above  the company agreed to make cash payments totaling  and issued warrants to purchase  shares of cheniere common stock at a price of per share to the consultants 
at december   the company had outstanding a short term note payable in the amount of  this note was canceled in march in connection with cheniere s sale of an interest in freeport lng 
cheniere s obligations under lng site options are renewable on an annual or semiannual basis 
cheniere may terminate its obligation at any time by electing not to renew or by exercising the option 
recoverability of investment in oil and gas properties the recoverability of the company s unevaluated oil and gas properties is dependent on future events  including obtaining adequate financing for its exploration and development program  the successful reprocessing of the d seismic data in the offshore texas project area  the successful sale of prospects generated by the company or the successful completion of its planned drilling program  and the achievement of a level of operating revenues that is sufficient to support the company s cost structure 
at various times during the life of the company to date  it has been necessary for the company to raise additional capital through private placements of debt or equity financing 
when such a need has arisen  the company has met it successfully 
it is management s belief that it will continue to be able to meet its needs for additional capital as such needs arise in the future 
cheniere s needs for additional financing include the following 
additional capital may be required to pay for cheniere s share of costs relating to the drilling of prospects and development of those that are successful  to exercise lease options and to acquire additional oil and gas leases 
the total amount of the company s capital needs will be determined in part by the number of prospects generated within its exploration program  by the working interest that the company retains in those prospects and by the company s ability to identify partners willing to bear a portion of drilling costs which would otherwise be attributable to the company 

the company may need capital to fund its pro rata share of the capital calls by gryphon that are approved by gryphon s board of directors 
if the company subscribes to its pro rata portion of such capital calls but fails to fund  it would lose its ability to subscribe to any future capital calls and would suffer further dilution of its holdings in gryphon 
in  gryphon made cash calls in the aggregate amount of  which were funded entirely by warburg  in march  june  september and november cheniere declined to participate in these cash calls and its interest in gryphon has been reduced from to on an as converted basis  as of december  it is anticipated that gryphon will make cash calls for additional funds 
the company s share of such future capital calls could total up to approximately  if the company elects not to fund its pro rata portion of such capital calls  and warburg funds its portion  as they would be entitled to do  and as they have since the formation of gryphon  the company s ownership percentage of gryphon s common stock on an as converted basis will be further reduced to as low as 

the company will need substantial additional funds to execute its plan for developing and expanding its lng receiving terminal business  including engineering  environmental  marine  regulatory  construction and legal work  including any such work involved in permitting and ferc filings related to cheniere s second and third sites 
such costs are estimated to be approximately  per year for each terminal to be developed 
additional capital could be obtained from a combination of funding sources  many of which may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
these potential funding sources include 
cash flow from operating activities  which is sensitive to prices the company receives for its oil and natural gas  
borrowings from financial institutions  which may subject the company to certain restrictive covenants  including covenants restricting the company s ability to raise additional capital or pay dividends  
debt offerings  which would increase the company s leverage and add to its need for cash to service such debt  
additional offerings of the company s equity securities  which would cause dilution of its common stock  
sales of portions of its working interest in the prospects within its exploration program  which would reduce future revenues from its exploration program  
sale to an industry partner of a participation in the company s exploration program  which would reduce future revenues from its exploration program  
sale of all or a portion of the company s producing oil and gas properties  which would reduce future revenues  
additional sales of interests in the company s lng projects and 
arrangement of a business development loan from  or prepayment of terminal use fees by  prospective sellers or purchasers of lng 
cheniere s ability to raise additional capital will depend on the results of its operations and the status of various capital and industry markets at the time such additional capital is sought 
accordingly  capital may not become available to the company from any particular source or at all 
even if additional capital becomes available  it may not be on terms acceptable to the company 
failure to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms may have a material adverse effect on the company s business  results of operations and financial condition 
other matters critical accounting estimates and policies the selection and application of accounting policies is an important process that has developed as cheniere s business activities have evolved and as the accounting rules have developed 
accounting rules generally do not involve a selection among alternatives  but involve an implementation and interpretation of existing rules  and the use of judgment  to the specific set of circumstances existing in cheniere s business 
the company makes every effort to properly comply with all applicable rules on or before their adoption  and believes the proper implementation and consistent application of the accounting rules is critical 
however  not all situations are specifically addressed in the accounting literature 
in these cases  the company must use its best judgment to adopt a policy for accounting for these situations 
cheniere accomplishes this by analogizing to similar situations and the accounting guidance governing them  and often consults with its independent accountants about the appropriate interpretation and application of these policies 
cheniere s most critical accounting policy is its accounting under the full cost method of accounting 
this area involves complex situations and a high degree of judgment either in the application and interpretation of existing literature or in the development of estimates that impact the company s financial statements 
full cost method of accounting the company follows the full cost method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
under this method  all productive and non productive exploration and development costs incurred for the purpose of finding oil and gas reserves are capitalized 
such capitalized costs include lease acquisition  geological and geophysical work  delay rentals  drilling  completing and equipping oil and gas wells  together with internal costs directly attributable to property acquisition  exploration and development activities 
interest is capitalized on oil and gas properties not subject to amortization and in the process of development 
the costs of the company s oil and gas properties  including the estimated future costs to develop proved reserves  are depreciated using a composite units of production rate based on estimates of proved reserves 
investments in unproved properties and major development projects are not amortized until proved reserves associated with the projects can be determined or until impairment occurs 
if the results of an assessment indicate that the properties are impaired  the amount of the impairment is added to the capitalized costs to be amortized 
net capitalized costs are limited to a capitalization ceiling  calculated on a quarterly basis as the aggregate of the present value  discounted at  of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  based on current economic and operating conditions  plus the lower of cost or fair market value of unproved properties  less related income tax effects 
at june  and september   the company s capitalized costs exceeded its capitalization ceiling  resulting in ceiling test write downs totaling  for the year 
the company s allocation of seismic exploration costs to proved properties involves an estimate of the total reserves to be discovered in the project 
it is reasonably possible  based on the results obtained from future drilling  that revisions to this estimate could occur within the next twelve months  which could affect the company s capitalization ceiling 
commodity prices the company s revenues  operating results  financial condition and ability to borrow funds or obtain additional capital depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and  to a lesser extent  oil 
declines in oil and gas prices may materially adversely affect cheniere s financial condition  liquidity  ability to obtain financing and operating results 
lower oil and gas prices also may reduce the amount of oil and gas that the company can produce economically 
historically  oil and gas prices and markets have been volatile  with prices fluctuating widely  and they are likely to continue to be volatile 
depressed prices in the future would have a negative impact on cheniere s future financial results 
in particular  substantially lower prices would significantly reduce revenue and could potentially impact the outcome of the company s ceiling test under regulation s x rule because cheniere s reserves are predominantly natural gas  changes in natural gas prices may have a particularly large impact on its financial results 
oil and gas reserves the process of estimating quantities of proved reserves is inherently uncertain  and the reserve data included in this document are only estimates 
reserve engineering is a subjective process of estimating underground accumulations of natural gas and crude oil that cannot be measured in an exact manner 
the process relies on interpretations of available geologic  geophysic  engineering and production data 
the extent  quality and reliability of this technical data can vary 
the process also requires certain economic assumptions  some of which are mandated by the sec  such as oil and gas prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of the quality and quantity of available data  the interpretation of that data  the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions and the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
cheniere s proved reserve information included in this document is substantially based on estimates prepared by ryder scott company 
estimates prepared by others may be higher or lower than cheniere s estimates 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from actual results  reserve estimates may be different from the quantities of natural gas and crude oil that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
the present value of future net cash flows does not necessarily represent the current market value of cheniere s estimated proved natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the company bases the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
cheniere s rate of recording depreciation  depletion and amortization expense dd a is dependent upon its estimate of proved reserves 
if the estimate of proved reserves declines  the rate at which cheniere records dd a expense increases  reducing net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
equity method of accounting the company uses the equity method of accounting to account for its investment in gryphon in accordance with apb no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
we consider the equity method to be appropriate  because the company exercises significant influence over the operating and financial policies of gryphon through its two member board participation on gryphon s six member board
