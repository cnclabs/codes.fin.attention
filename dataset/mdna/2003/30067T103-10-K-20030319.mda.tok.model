item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and notes thereto set forth in item critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  inventories  and income taxes 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
the company s revenues are generated from the following product sales  including product upgrades and replacement part sales  maintenance agreements  and agreements for services to be rendered 
for services rendered  customers are billed and revenues are recognized as the related services are performed 
the company s product lines principally consist of laser based systems and electro optical components used in a wide range of applications by different types of end users and are often used as sub assemblies required for end products manufactured by the customer 
revenue relating to these products is recognized upon transfer of title to the customer  which is generally the shipment date 
with respect to maintenance agreements  revenue is recognized and customers are generally billed on a monthly or quarterly basis over the term of the agreement 
the company manufactures one product called a photomask defect repair system drs which was formerly manufactured and sold by quantronix but is now being manufactured and sold by csi 
drs s are laser based systems for use in semiconductor photomask repair 
the drs provides a means to repair defects on the complex photomasks used to produce integrated circuits 
these are very large  highly complex machines ranging in price from million to million per unit based upon the most recent range of historical sales prices 
the terms of sale with respect to these items require that the company perform installation due to the technical expertise required 
due to the post shipment installation obligations with respect to the drs s  the company defers revenue recognition on the sale of drs s until it has substantially satisfied its post shipment obligations allowances for doubtful accounts the company is required to estimate the collectibility of its trade receivables 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the collectibility of accounts receivable is evaluated based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where the company is aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filings  a specific reserve for bad debts is recorded against amounts due  to reduce the net recognized receivable to the amount the company reasonably believes will be collected 
for all other customers  management estimates a reserve for bad debts based upon the total accounts receivable balance and the percentage expected to be realized through subsequent cash collections 
if circumstances change ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
inventories on a quarterly basis  the company compares the amount of inventory on hand and under commitment with its latest forecasted requirements to determine whether write downs for excess or obsolete inventory are required 
although the writedowns for excess or obsolete inventory reflected in the company s consolidated balance sheet at december  and are considered adequate by the company s management  there can be no assurance that these writedowns will prove to be adequate over time to cover ultimate losses in connection with the company s inventory 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that it believes is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made 
as of december  and  the company has approximately thousand and million of net deferred tax assets  respectively  related principally to domestic and foreign loss carryforwards and inventory reserves 
should the pretax book income and taxable income be considerably lower than projected  an increase to the valuation allowance may be required 
recent accounting pronouncements on january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statements no 
 business combinations sfas  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas requires the use of the purchase method of accounting and prohibits the use of the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations completed on or after july  and further clarifies the criteria for recognition of intangible assets separately from goodwill 
sfas eliminates the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets and initiates an annual review for impairment 
identifiable intangible assets with determinable useful lives will continue to be amortized 
beginning january   the company ceased amortizing goodwill 
during  the company has completed its assessment of the assets impacted by the adoption of sfas  and based upon such review no impairment to the carrying value of goodwill was identified 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the company has adopted both sfas and sfas as of january  these statements did not materially impact the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this pronouncement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   and requires these costs to be recognized when the liability is incurred and not at project initiation 
the company does not expect this statement to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements

if current cash and equivalents that may be generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy the company s liquidity requirements  the company may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or increase its lines of credit 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to the company s stockholders

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which the company is exposed are interest rates on demand deposits with banks and money market funds and exchange rates  generating translation and transaction gains and losses 
interest rates the company manages its cash and investment portfolios considering investment opportunities and risks  tax consequences and overall financing strategies 
the company s investment portfolios consist primarily of cash and equivalents  with carrying amounts approximating market value 
assuming year end variable cash and investment levels  a one point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on interest income 
foreign exchange rates operating in international markets involves exposure to movements in currency exchange rates that are volatile at times 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on the company is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  could cause the company to adjust its financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors
