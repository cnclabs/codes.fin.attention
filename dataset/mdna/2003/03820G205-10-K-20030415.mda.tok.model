part i item business the company applied imaging corp 
applied imaging  the company  we or our was incorporated in california in july  and reincorporated in delaware in october in november  we completed an initial public offering of common stock that is listed on the nasdaq national market under the symbol aicx 
we are headquartered in santa clara  california  and have facilities in the united kingdom uk 
we are the world s leading provider of automated instrument systems for cytogenetics  the analysis of chromosomes in cells 
our products are sold worldwide through a direct sales force  third party distributors and independent sales representatives 
we employ approximately people worldwide 
the company was founded to develop  manufacture  and market automated genetic imaging systems for use in cytogenetic laboratories for cancer testing  prenatal testing and other genetic testing applications 
we sell our products to government and private clinical laboratories  research institutions  universities  and pharmaceutical companies located in the united states us  canada  europe  japan and other countries 
we also market imaging systems designed for use in plant and animal genetic research programs 
in addition  in  we introduced and received clearance from the us food and drug administration fda for a clinical system to detect micrometastatic cancer cells in bone marrow from cancer patients 
micrometastic cancer cells are generally undetectable using routine cancer screening tests due to their rarity low frequency of occurrence 
this system and its research capabilities assists physicians in determining the initial staging of cancer cases  in detecting disease recurrence and in genetically characterizing cancer cells 
this was the forerunner of our strategic thrust into the cancer pathology market with the mds system 
we have an installed base of over  instruments in over  laboratories and clinics in more than countries 
our cytovision  powergene and quips systems are widely utilized because of their ability to analyze human chromosome preparations using powerful software classification algorithms and a specialized user interface 
these systems also incorporate the capability to analyze and record images produced by advanced genetic research assays that employ fluorescent in situ hybridization fish  a technique to detect chromosomal changes in cells using fluorescent tagged dna segments  or comparative genomic hybridization cgh techniques to measure the amount of a given genetic sequence in a cell 
in  we released two new genetic analysis systems  ariol and spot  that combine with our mds systems to form the oncopath series of systems 
the ariol system is a high throughput system designed to automate and standardize the analysis of immunohistochemistry ihc and fish test results in clinical laboratories 
the ariol system is designed to assist the pathologist and oncologist in their review of key breast cancer ihc tests 
the system is also designed to detect micrometastatic cancer cells that may be found in bone marrow and other clinical samples 
the ariol system is the second generation of the company s pioneering mds system 
the spot genetic analysis system automatically detects and counts fluorescent labeled dna probe signals in cells 
the system is designed for a range of applications  one of which is to assist in the detection of specific genetic abnormalities that identify which patients may respond to new molecularly targeted therapies 
for example  the system is designed to automate the analysis of a fluorescent dna probe assay that may be a factor in the selection of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia to receive novartis gleevec therapy 
we are developing data on these uses and various applications of the ariol and spot systems that will allow us to obtain additional clearances from the fda for promotion of these applications with specific medical or diagnostic claims 
our mds system combines the ability to find targeted cancer cells using brightfield microscopy techniques  in which microscopes use white light to illuminate tissues and cells  with our decade long experience in fluorescence microscopy imaging and analysis  in which narrow wavelengths of light are used to detect fluorescent tags that have been inserted into the cells or tissue sections being examined under a microscope 
taken together  these technologies allow us to analyze the proteins on or within a cell while simultaneously assessing which genes within that cell have been activated or expressed 
both protein and gene expression data are emerging as required parameters when assessing the precise nature of a given tumor or cancer cell 
gene and protein expression data are increasingly being used to select the most effective cancer therapies for individual patients 
we pursued a prenatal genetic screening development program from through focused on the isolation of specific fetal cells from a blood sample taken from the expectant mother 
while substantial research progress was made towards the development of a reliable method for non invasive prenatal diagnosis  we concluded that our methods did not constitute a commercially viable system for this purpose 
accordingly  we shifted our research efforts and resources in to our cancer imaging programs  with a focus on the detection of rare micrometastatic cancer cells in a variety of sample types 
however  we believe that certain of the cell enrichment and image analysis products we developed for fetal cell analysis may be directly applicable to these cancer testing applications  such as the use of our imaging platform to detect circulating cancer cells in peripheral blood 
cancer and prenatal cytogenetics all genetic information in an organism is contained in its chromosomes  made up of strands of dna and associated protein molecules 
dna is comprised of paired nucleotide bases and genetic information is encoded by the specific order of the nucleotide bases within units called genes 
genes are organized linearly along the chromosomes and carry the required information for the synthesis of the proteins that provide the structural components of cells and tissues  as well as the enzymes needed for the basic biochemical and physiological functions of the cells 
chromosomal studies allow clinicians to examine genetic rearrangements at both a macro level  while studying all chromosomes of a patient simultaneously  or at a micro level  while examining specific dna probes for individual genes or chromosomes 
in the us  approximately  cytogenetic test procedures are performed annually 
cytogenetic testing includes prenatal screening for genetic disorders using amniotic fluid or chorionic villus sampling 
the most rapidly growing segment of the cytogenetic testing market includes those tests for the diagnosis and prognosis of cancerous conditions using bone marrow  blood and tissue samples 
chromosomal analyses are often performed for clinical and research purposes for the precise characterization of many different types of cancers 
cancer cells frequently demonstrate complex chromosomal abnormalities 
the specific patterns of these chromosomal abnormalities may be associated with certain well defined cancers 
the chromosomal analysis of leukemias and lymphomas  for example  provides researchers with supplementary information useful in the staging or precise classification of the disease and may also provide useful indicators of patient prognosis 
similarly  advanced chromosomal analyses may allow a researcher to assess new disease in a patient to determine if it may be a recurrence of a previous cancer or an entirely different neoplasm 
as in cancer  prenatal chromosomal disorders may occur when genes or portions of genes move between chromosomes  when portions of chromosomes or the genes they contain are missing or when an abnormal number of chromosomes are present in the cell 
chromosomes can be seen with the aid of a microscope and  when stained with certain dyes  reveal light and dark bands reflecting regional variations in the dna of the cell 
differences in size and banding pattern allow the chromosomes to be distinguished from each other or may help identify a chromosomal disorder 
the most common prenatal chromosomal disorder  down syndrome  also known as trisomy  occurs when there are three copies of chromosome in the human genome 
other prenatal clinical syndromes caused by the most common chromosomal abnormalities may result in mental retardation  impaired physical development and abnormal sexual development 
prenatal testing is the process of detecting certain types of chromosomal disorders in a fetus at an early stage of pregnancy 
definitive prenatal testing is currently performed invasively  by extracting fetal cells and inspecting the chromosomes within such cells to diagnose specific genetic disorders 
fetal cells are obtained by one of two common procedures  amniocentesis or chorionic villus sampling 
once the sample is extracted it is forwarded to a cytogenetic laboratory  where the cells are cultured and deposited on a microscope slide 
the slide is then examined under a microscope in order to locate and analyze a number of cells undergoing active cell division 
at this point  the chromosome complement of an individual cell is visible under the microscope 
our current products sold into this market are cv chromoscan system the cytovision chromoscan is our most comprehensive system for automated chromosome analysis 
the chromoscan integrates many of the key features of our earlier products into one system capable of automated microscope slide scanning  advanced chromosome analysis and fluorescent image processing 
the chromoscan allows laboratories to automatically scan slides to locate specific cells for chromosome analysis or other genetic studies utilizing fluorescent dna probes  thereby eliminating one of the most tedious and time consuming aspects of cytogenetic analysis that of manual slide scanning 
the system accomplishes this in the background while simultaneously allowing the technologist to process and analyze images previously identified 
we believe that no other commercially available system for cytogenetic analysis incorporates this same range of features in one integrated and automated package 
cytovision system the cytovision system is a comprehensive chromosome analysis system that integrates standard karyotyping capability  the capability of presenting a standard image of chromosomes  with advanced fish imaging technologies  including color chromosome analysis techniques 
the system s computerized image capture and analysis capabilities incorporate pattern recognition and automated chromosome classification algorithms 
the system provides automated karyotyping capabilities  a variety of user defined image enhancement features  and report annotation capabilities and full screen display options 
the dna imaging capability of the cytovision detects and analyzes signals from dna probes that have been applied to cell nuclei 
cytovision systems enhance images of often faint fluorescent dna probes and provide the operator with a range of optimized analytical tools 
the systems may also be upgraded to detect genetic amplifications and deletions in tumor cells utilizing a research technique known as cgh spot system the spot genetic analysis system was introduced in and is based on the cytovision architecture 
the system is specifically designed to automatically detect and count fluorescent labeled dna probe signals in cells 
the system is designed for a range of applications  one of which is to assist in the detection of specific genetic abnormalities that identify which patients may respond to new molecularly targeted therapies 
for example  the system is designed to automate the analysis of a fluorescent dna probe assay that may be a factor in the selection of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia to receive novartis gleevec therapy 
all of the product modules in the cytovision family are compatible with one another and can be easily integrated into a comprehensive network based system with common data management protocols 
powergene system our powergene products are the integrated chromosome analysis systems most often used by the largest commercial clinical laboratories worldwide 
with a powerful intuitive user interface that facilitates the training of cytogenetic technologists in a variety of settings  powergene systems take full advantage of the ease of use features associated with apple macintosh platforms 
we acquired the powergene product line in july from international remote imaging systems  inc quips system our quips systems offer advanced fish imaging tools to researchers worldwide 
these systems were among the first to incorporate high sensitivity digital imaging capabilities along with the ability to analyze new dna probe techniques such as m fish and pre implantation cytogenetics 
based on the apple macintosh platform  quips systems allow researchers who have developed techniques on apple systems to continue their research with the most current hardware and software solutions for the macintosh 
we acquired the quips product line as one part of a strategic alliance with vysis  inc  the leading provider of dna probe reagents for cancer and prenatal testing 
cancer pathology testing there are an increasing number of therapeutic products either being marketed or under development by the pharmaceutical industry that target specific abnormalities in genes or proteins found in cancer patients 
generally  these therapeutics require sophisticated diagnostic tests to determine which patients have a specific abnormality and would therefore be candidates for the therapy under consideration 
this advance selection of patients is often required by the fda before approval of a highly specific therapy 
the necessary diagnostic tests are typically conducted on a tissue sample of the tumor and can utilize various staining techniques to detect a protein or gene expression of interest 
these tests may require brightfield microscopy in order to interpret the protein expression or fluorescent microscopy to interpret dna probe results 
interpretation and analysis of the tests can be conducted either manually through a microscope or with an instrument such as our ariol or mds systems that automates the imaging and interpretation of tissue based pathology assays 
we believe that the mds system is currently the only clinical imaging system capable of analyzing both protein and gene expression levels using both brightfield and fluorescence illumination on a single platform 
the mds system provides the pathologist with the capability to automatically detect cells of interest in a tissue specimen and to precisely qualify the results of a wide range of tests 
the ariol and mds systems are designed to assist pathologists in their review of key breast cancer tests 
these include breast cancer tests that examine the following biological factors her neu immunohistochemistry ihc ki cell proliferation marker estrogen receptor er tumor hormone receptor marker progesterone receptor pr tumor hormone receptor marker p tumor suppressor oncogene ae ae pan cytokeratin antibody nuclear ihc markers cytoplasmic ihc markers 
the ariol and mds systems offers a broad range of multiparametric analyses to aid pathologists in the interpretation of complex test results 
we expect that the ariol and mds  with the spot systems  and future variants of these systems may be the primary driver of our future sales growth 
in  we introduced our pathvysion digital scoring application that provides the first automated imaging capability to assist in detecting amplification of the her neu gene in tissue 
this application utilizes the mds system to automate the analysis of a complex fluorescent assay that is an important factor in the selection of certain breast cancer patients to receive genentech s herceptin  a drug for treating certain types of breast cancer 
the pathvysion digital scoring application automates the analysis of the results of the pathvysion her dna probe kit developed by vysis  inc to detect amplification of the her neu gene in breast cancer tissue using fish techniques 
pathvysion is a trademark of vysis  inc used under license by applied imaging 
herceptin is a registered trademark of genentech  inc the pathvysion digital scoring application is available on the mds 
the ihc applications and the pathvysion application are released to clinical and research sites for research use  pending application to the food and drug administration for full clearance of the applications for routine clinical use 
with regard to the above described cancer pathology applications  we have developed  or are developing  data on these uses and other applications of the ariol and mds systems in various studies 
however  until we submit and obtain clearances from the fda  we cannot make medical or diagnostic claims for these applications 
cancer pathology rare cell micrometastasis detection micrometastasis is the spread of cancer away from the primary tumor that is not detectable with routine testing methods 
typically  these metastases are too limited in size to be observed using routine examination techniques 
the majority of micrometastases are attributable to a subset of cancer known as carcinomas  a malignant growth that arises from epithelial cells found in the skin or the lining of body organs 
carcinomas tend to infiltrate into adjacent tissue and then spread metastasize to distant organs such as bone  liver  lung or the brain 
the initial application for micrometastases testing is found among patients at the time of initial diagnosis for breast  prostate  colorectal and gastric carcinomas 
when micrometastatic cells are identified in distant locations  the staging of the patient s disease will typically change to reflect the presence of distant metastases  an indication of much more advanced disease 
this testing is expected to be performed in addition to normal staging parameters and will aid in the most appropriate diagnosis and treatment of these patients 
this market is large and developing with over million new carcinoma cases diagnosed each year and approximately million patients being monitored for the recurrence of cancer on an annual basis 
early detection and treatment of micrometastatic disease would result in improved patient outcomes and significant cost savings to the health care system 
we estimate the potential market for monitoring cancer patients for early disease recurrence encompasses the  primary cancer centers in the us  europe and japan and is estimated at million annually 
in addition  we have initiated pre clinical trials of blood based micrometastasis assays that may expand the potential market opportunity for the mds and related testing reagents to million annually 
our current products designed for use in the cancer pathology market are mds system the mds consists of a custom scanning microscopy system that has been optimized for the analysis of bone marrow  lymph node and stem cell preparations to detect rare cancer cells that have been stained by a variety of laboratory techniques 
the mds scans microscope slides to automatically detect the presence of rare cancer cells in the sample 
additionally  the mds can genetically characterize these cells for specific gene sequences to determine if a metastasizing cell comes from the patient s primary tumor or if it is a biologically aggressive cell 
it is capable of identifying cancer cells in concentrations as low as one cancer cell per one million normal cells 
designed with fully integrated fluorescent detection capabilities  the mds allows researchers to apply an extraordinarily wide range of dna probes to individual cells in order to characterize them at a molecular level 
the system s ability to automatically scan and characterize cancer cells is more accurate  consistent and efficient than manual screening 
the ability to detect and characterize micrometastatic cancer cells provides the oncologist with important additional information for the selection of the most appropriate treatment for the patient 
the detection of micrometastasis may lead to more aggressive treatment and follow up than would otherwise be indicated 
in and  we conducted clinical evaluations that demonstrated significant improvements in the ability of pathologists to detect tumor cells when aided by the mds 
performance has been consistent and reproducible across multiple instruments and sites 
in august  we received k clearance from the fda to market the mds for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to pathologists in the detection and classification of specific rare cancer cells based on size  shape intensity of staining patterns and other factors 
ariol system the ariol system was introduced in and is the second generation of the mds system 
it is a high throughput system designed to automate and standardize the analysis of ihc and fish test results in clinical laboratories 
the ariol system was designed to assist the pathologist and oncologist in their review of breast cancer tests 
it is expected that additional applications  including automated fish analysis for dna probes  will be released in  subject to appropriate fda clearances regarding their promotion 
the system is also designed to detect micrometastatic cancer cells that may be found in bone marrow and other clinical samples 
cancer detection reagents we have obtained an exclusive option from stemcell technologies  inc sti for a technology that may allow for the detection of circulating tumor cells in peripheral blood samples

we initiated pre clinical trials of this technology  in conjunction with our mds system  during and these trials were completed in we are evaluating the results of these trials and  if the results of these pre clinical trials are positive  and if funding is available  we plan to develop a consumable reagent kit that will be used to isolate circulating tumor cells 
we are evaluating licensing options  as well as strategic and product distribution relationships with companies offering specialized clinical and research reagents targeted at the cancer research market that we are pursuing for oncopath placements 
plant and animal genetics a highly active area of basic research and commercial product development is the advanced analysis of plant and animal genomes 
researchers apply chromosome analysis techniques to plants and animals that have wide variations in the makeup of their chromosome complements 
the analysis of chromosomes from animal and plant species has proven valuable in the development and testing of genetic improvements to crops  in cancer studies using animal models and in different veterinary applications 
this market is currently growing and is served by our proprietary genus system 
genus was adapted from technology pioneered on our cytovision systems 
genus incorporates flexible modules that allow researchers to customize the system  for studies of specific plant or animal species 
certain of these analytical capabilities have also been made available to macintosh users of our powergene systems

we are evaluating licensing options  as well as strategic and product distribution relationships with companies offering specialized clinical and research reagents targeted at the cancer research market that we are pursuing for oncopath placements 
in august  we entered into a strategic alliance with dako corporation  a fully integrated  global provider of cancer diagnostic and research products for pathology and oncology  for the development and marketing of image analysis applications for ihc and genetic probe assays 
the agreement with dako has an initial term of three years and automatically renews after that for additional one year terms unless cancelled by us or dako with days notice 
any mds imaging analysis applications developed for use with dako assays will require fda approval before we can market them for routine clinical use 
however  the applications may be marketed and used by laboratories subject to the laboratories internal validation of the applications and appropriate labeling of the application by us 
in january  we placed our first application  in alpha prototype  which will automatically image and interpret the results of tissue microarray studies on our mds system with one of our collaborators 
tissue microarray technology is entering widespread use as the most efficient method for rapidly testing large numbers of gene and protein targets in tissues for pharmaceutical development and basic research purposes 
we expect to continue development of this technology in using the ariol system 
patents and proprietary rights we have pursued patent protection and to date have been granted thirteen patents and have other patent applications pending in the us our patent portfolio also includes multiple patents and pending applications that protect our technology in other countries 
in addition to patents  we rely upon trade secrets  know how and contractual arrangements to protect certain of our proprietary information and products 
we also generally enter into confidentiality agreements with our employees and consultants designed to both protect our confidential information and prevent the disclosure of confidential information of prior employers and others 
we also rely upon trademarks to protect certain of our products  and hold us trademark registrations for the marks quips  cytoscan  powergene and rxfish 
we hold registrations for these marks and the mark cytovision in certain foreign jurisdictions 
we also have certain other trademark rights in the us and other foreign countries 
competition the market for our cytogenetic products is highly competitive 
we believe that our primary competitors in this market include metasystems  leica microsystems and applied spectral imaging 
the principal competitive factors in this market are product features offered  ease of use  clarity of output  customer service capabilities  price and installed base 
we believe that we compete favorably with regard to these factors 
the market for the ariol and mds system in cancer pathology is new and under development 
our primary competitors in this market are chromavision medical systems  inc and metasystems 
we believe our systems ability to analyze both proteins and genes in cells distinguishes us from competition 
government regulation the testing  manufacturing  labeling  distribution  sales  and marketing of our products are subject to government regulation in the us and in other countries 
we believe that our future success will be significantly dependent upon commercial sales of our oncopath systems  consisting of our mds  ariol and spot systems 
these systems are currently used for a number of applications 
before we can promote these systems for specific applications in the us  we will need to obtain fda clearances 
we have k clearance for our mds  cytovision and powergene systems in the us we also have obtained fda clearance from the fda to market the mds for in vitro diagnostic use as an aid to pathologists in the detection and classification of specific rare cancer cells based on size  shape intensity of staining patterns and other factors 
in the us  our products are also subject to regulation in the state of california whose requirements in this area include registration with the state and compliance with state gmp regulations 
in march  we received a warning letter from the fda regarding our promotional material for specific applications on the ariol system 
the letter requires us to modify our promotional practices for specific applications of the ariol system until we obtain any required fda clearances 
we believe that we can satisfactorily meet the fda requirements and are in the process of responding to the fda letter 
failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner  however  may result in regulatory action being taken by the fda 
these actions could include seizure  injunction and or civil monetary penalties 
before a new medical device can be introduced into the market  the manufacturer must obtain fda clearance of a k or premarket approval pma  unless the device is exempt from the requirement of such clearance or approval 
a k clearance will be granted if the submitted information establishes that the device is substantially equivalent to a legally marketed class i or ii medical device or to a legally marketed class iii device that does not itself require an approved pma prior to marketing predicate device 
a k must contain information to support a claim of substantial equivalence  which may include laboratory test results or the results of clinical studies of the device in humans 
the fda is required to review k submissions within days  but it generally takes from five to twelve months from the date of submission to obtain k clearance from the fda  it may take longer and k clearance may never be obtained 
the fda may determine that a device is not substantially equivalent to a predicate device  or that additional information is needed before a substantial equivalence determination can be made 
in addition to domestic regulation of medical devices  our current products and the products we have under development are subject to corresponding regulations governing safety processes  manufacturing processes and quality in foreign jurisdictions in which we operate or such products are sold 
upon the adoption of the in vitro diagnostic medial device directive of october   the european community and its member countries currently are imposing more substantial regulation on in vitro diagnostic devices and equipment like medical devices  and such regulation may affect the company s current products and products under development 
marketed devices are subject to pervasive and continuing regulatory oversight by the fda and other agencies  including record keeping requirements and reporting of adverse experiences with the use of the device 
device manufacturers are required to register their establishments and list their devices with the fda and certain state agencies 
the federal food  drug and cosmetic act and certain state laws require that medical devices be manufactured in accordance with the quality system regulations qsregs 
manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by the fda and certain state agencies on a periodic basis to monitor compliance with gmp  qsregs and other requirements 
we are also subject to other federal  state  local and foreign laws  regulations and recommendations relating to safe working conditions and good laboratory practices 
the extent of government regulation that might result from any future legislation or administrative action cannot be accurately predicted 
employees as of march   we employed a total of people  including in research and development  in manufacturing  in sales  marketing and customer service and in finance and administration 
as of march   of our employees were based in the us  in the united kingdom  in france  in germany  and in israel

additional factors that might affect future results the following represent some of the factors that create risk and uncertainty for our business and us 
if any of the following factors actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
we have a history of operating losses and may never achieve profitability 
we have not been profitable on a fiscal year basis since our inception in we incurred net losses of  and million in and  respectively 
we recorded profits in the second and third quarters of of  and  respectively 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we will continue to incur significant costs as we continue our efforts to develop and market our oncopath systems 
if we do achieve profitability in any period  we may not be able to sustain or increase our profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we have substantial funding requirements 
additional funding may not be available to us or may not be available on acceptable terms 
we have expended and will continue to expend substantial amounts of money for research and development  preclinical testing  planned clinical investigations  capital expenditures  working capital needs and manufacturing and marketing of our products 
our future research and development efforts  in particular  are expected to include development of additional applications of our current cytogenetic products and additional applications for the oncopath systems  which will likely require additional funds 
if we do not achieve our projected revenue targets or costs are higher than projected  we may incur negative cash flow from operations during the exact timing and amount of spending required cannot be accurately determined and will depend on several factors  including progress of our research and development efforts and planned clinical investigations  competing technological and market developments  commercialization of products currently under development by us and our competitors  and market acceptance and demand for our products 
to the extent necessary  we may seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  you will experience dilution of your holdings in our common stock 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate and acceptable financing is not available  we may have to delay development or commercialization of certain of our products or license to third parties the rights to commercialize certain of our products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize 
we may also reduce our marketing  customer support or other resources devoted to our products 
any of these options could reduce our sales growth and result in continued net losses 
the marketing and sale of our products requires regulatory approval and on going certifications 
we have received a warning letter regarding our promotion of the ariol system  to which we must adequately respond 
failure to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals and certifications could prevent or delay our ability to market and sell our products and may subject us to significant regulatory fines or penalties 
the fda regulates design  testing  manufacturing  labeling  distribution  marketing  sales and service of our products 
our products are marketed in the us according to premarket notifications to the fda under section k of the us food  drug and cosmetic act 
unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the us must first receive either k clearance or premarket approval from the fda 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from three to months  but may take longer 
the premarket approval process generally takes from one to three years from the time fda files the application  but it can be significantly longer and can be significantly more expensive 
although we have obtained the necessary k clearance for our products  our k clearance can be revoked if safety or effectiveness problems develop 
we may need to seek additional regulatory approval for clearances if we modify existing products or intend to market other products under development and cannot be certain that we would obtain k clearance or premarket approval in a timely manner or at all 
if the fda requires us to seek k clearance or premarket approval for any modification to a previously cleared product  we also may be required to cease marketing or recall the modified device until we obtain such clearance or approval 
delays in obtaining clearances or approvals will adversely affect our ability to market and sell our products and may subject us to significant regulatory fines or penalties  which would result in a decline in revenue and profitability 
in march  we received a warning letter from the fda regarding our promotional material for specific applications on the ariol system 
the letter requires us to modify our promotional practices for specific applications of the ariol system until we obtain any required fda clearances 
we believe that we can satisfactorily meet the fda requirements and are in the process of responding to the fda letter 
failure to respond in a timely and adequate manner  however  may result in regulatory action being taken by the fda 
these actions could include seizure  injunction and or civil monetary penalties 
we expect quarterly revenue and operating results to vary significantly in future periods  which could cause our stock price to fluctuate 
if our operating results are below expectations  our stock price could drop 
we have experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  and we expect to continue to experience fluctuations in the future 
our customers  who are primarily public and private clinical laboratories  research organizations and hospitals  generally operate on annual budgets 
their budgeting cycles and spending practices affect our revenues 
factors that may have an influence on our operating results in any particular quarter include demand for our products  seasonality of our sales  new product introductions by us or our competitors  and the costs and time required for a transition to the new products  delays in the timing of introduction of new products  systems or applications due to longer research and development cycles than anticipated  timing of orders and shipments for capital equipment sales  our mix of sales between our distributors and our direct sales force  competition  including pricing pressures  timing and amount of research and development expenses  including clinical and pre clinical trial related expenditures  foreign currency fluctuations  and delays between our incurrence of expenses to develop new products  including expenses related to marketing and service capabilities  and the timing of sales and payments received for the new products 
in addition  because we develop applications for our imaging systems  a delay in the release of a system would result in the delay of applications for the system 
it is possible in the future that our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if our operating results fall below market expectations  the price of our common stock could drop significantly 
we recently transferred our stock listing from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market  which could adversely affect our ability to raise capital 
we recently transferred our stock listing from the nasdaq national market to the less followed nasdaq smallcap market as of february  in order to meet the less stringent nasdaq smallcap listing requirements 
this stock listings transfer could adversely affect the liquidity and price of our stock since the nasdaq smallcap market is less followed by investors than the nasdaq national market 
as a result  there may be less demand for our stock by investors and we may be unable to raise sufficient capital to fund our operations 
nasdaq could remove our common stock from the nasdaq smallcap market  which could materially adversely affect your investment in our common stock 
if we continue to experience losses from operations and are unable to raise additional capital  we may be unable to maintain the standards for continued listing on the nasdaq smallcap market  and the shares of our common stock could be subject to delisting from the nasdaq smallcap market 
trading in our common stock would therefore likely be subject to the so called penny stock rules that impose additional sales practice and market making requirements on broker dealers who sell and or make a market in those securities 
consequently  removal from the nasdaq smallcap market  if it were to occur  could affect the ability or willingness of broker dealers to sell and or make a market on our common stock and the ability of purchasers of our common stock to sell their securities in the secondary market 
certain penny stock rules apply  however  even if our common stock is quoted on the nasdaq smallcap market if our stock price is below per share 
these rules could further limit the market liquidity of our common stock and the ability of investors to sell our common stock in the secondary market 
we will need to effectively manage our growth in order to achieve and sustain profitability 
our failure to manage growth effectively could reduce our sales growth and result in continued net losses 
if we are able to achieve significant growth in our future sales and to expand the scope of our operations  our management  financial  manufacturing and other capabilities  procedures and controls could be strained 
we cannot assure you that our existing or any additional capabilities  procedures  systems or controls will be adequate to support our operations 
we may not be able to design  implement or improve our capabilities  procedures  systems or controls in a timely and cost effective manner 
failure to implement  improve and expand our capabilities  procedures  systems and controls in an efficient and timely manner could reduce our sales growth and result in continued net losses 
the market for medical diagnostic equipment for cancer  prenatal and other genetic tests is extremely competitive 
our competitors may succeed in developing products  and obtaining related regulatory approvals  faster than us 
the medical diagnostic equipment industry is highly competitive and competition is likely to intensify 
certain of our competitors have greater financial and technical resources and production and marketing capabilities than us 
we cannot assure you that these competitors will not succeed in developing technologies and products that are more effective  easier to use or less expensive than those which are currently offered or being developed by us or that would render our technology and products obsolete and noncompetitive 
in addition  some of our competitors have significantly greater experience than we have in conducting clinical investigations of new diagnostic products and in obtaining fda and other regulatory clearances and approvals of products 
accordingly  our competitors may succeed in developing and obtaining regulatory approvals for such products more rapidly than us 
we operate in a consolidating industry  which creates barriers to our market penetration 
the healthcare industry in recent years has been characterized by consolidation 
large hospital chains and groups of affiliated hospitals prefer to negotiate comprehensive supply contracts for all of their supply needs at once 
large suppliers can often equip an entire laboratory and offer these hospital chains and groups one stop shopping for laboratory instruments  supplies and services 
larger suppliers also typically offer annual rebates to their customers based on the customer s total volume of business with the supplier 
the convenience and rebates offered by these larger suppliers are administrative and financial incentives that we do not offer our customers 
the success of our future plans will depend in part on our ability to overcome these and any new barriers resulting from continued consolidation in the healthcare industry 
any disruption or delay in the supply of components or custom subassemblies could require us to redesign our products or otherwise delay our ability to assemble our products  which could cause our sales to decline and result in continued net losses 
we assemble our products from a combination of i commodity technology components  such as computers and monitors  ii custom subassemblies  such as automated filter wheels  iii proprietary hardware for scanning microscopy and iv operating systems and proprietary applications software 
while we typically use components and subassemblies that are available from alternate sources  any unanticipated interruption of the supply of these components or subassemblies could require us to redesign our products or otherwise delay our ability to assemble our products  which could cause our sales to decline and result in continued net losses 
if we fail to comply with quality system regulations  our manufacturing operations could be delayed  and our product sales and profitability could suffer 
our manufacturing processes and those of our suppliers are required to comply with the fda s quality system regulation  or qsr  which covers the procedures and documentation of the design  testing  production  control  quality assurance  labeling  packaging  storage and shipping of our products 
the fda enforces the qsr through inspections 
we were subject to a qsr inspection in december  as a result of which  the fda made observations to which we responded 
following our response  the fda informed us that it did not intend to take further action 
we may be inspected in the future and we cannot assure you that we would pass any future inspections 
if we fail a qsr inspection  our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing delayed 
failure to take adequate corrective action in response to a qsr inspection could force a shutdown of our manufacturing operations and a recall of our products  which would cause our product sales and profitability to suffer 
the marketing and sale of our products outside of the us is subject to regulations  which vary from those in the us failure to obtain and maintain required regulatory approvals could prevent or delay our ability to market and sell our products in international markets 
the regulatory environment for testing  manufacturing  labeling  distributing  marketing and sale of our products varies from country to country 
currently  some of our products  and modifications to these products  may be subject to pre market approval in selected countries that are members of the european union 
our products  and modifications to these products  are also subject to other regulatory requirements in those and other countries 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in fines  injunctions  civil penalties  suspensions or loss of regulatory approvals  product recalls  seizure of products  operating restrictions and criminal prosecution 
our products have been classified in europe as in vitro diagnostic devices ivds  which are regulated under a different standard than medical devices 
as such  our products are subject to the requirements of the in vitro diagnostic medical device directive ivdd 
an ivd is defined as a device which is a reagent  reagent product  kit  instrument  equipment or system  whether used alone or in combination  intended by the manufacturer to be used in vitro for the examination of samples derived from the human body with a view to providing information on the physiological state  state of health or disease  or congenital abnormality 
ivds are specifically excluded from the provisions of the medical device directive mdd  although ivds are subject to equally stringent but different controls under the ivdd and other directives 
if it is determined that our products are marketed as or intended to be issued as equipment that can produce therapeutic effects or alleviate the symptoms of any disability  injury or illness  the equipment may then fall within the scope of the mdd and product registration and appropriate documentation  including possible clinical trials would be required prior to commercialization 
that same medical equipment  if also intended and promoted by us for use in the examination of samples derived from the human body with a view to providing information on the physiological state  state of health or disease  or congenital  abnormality  would be regulated under the ivdd  requiring performance data  including where appropriate  analytical sensitivity  diagnostic sensitivity  analytical specificity  diagnostic specificity  accuracy  repeatability and reproducibility 
although our products are currently regulated under the ivdd  european regulatory authorities may independently interpret our marketing and promotional claims as falling within the scope of the mdd  and require us to comply with its differing requirements  including substantiating any therapeutic claims 
a redefinition could harm our marketing and sales if we were restricted from marketing or selling our products until we are able to comply with the mdd 
moreover  a member state of the eu or any other european country could adopt other laws or regulations that require approval to market and sell our products 
we depend on distributors to sell our products outside of north america and the united kingdom 
sales through our distributors may be lower than direct sales efforts and the distributor arrangements could be terminated before the contract period ends 
we rely substantially on independent distributors and sales agents to market and sell our products outside of north america and the united kingdom 
we cannot assure you that distributors and agents will devote adequate resources to support sales of our products 
under our distribution agreements  we indemnify the distributors against costs  expenses and liabilities relating to litigation regarding our products 
despite our obligations  our distributors may decide to reduce or end their selling efforts until an infringement dispute is resolved or settled 
our international sales and operations are a significant portion of our business 
changes in international markets and currency fluctuations could lead to a decline in our revenues or result in continued net losses 
we have significant international operations based in the united kingdom 
as of march   approximately employees  constituting approximately of the total number of our employees  were based outside of the us we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from outside of the us in and  we derived approximately and of our total revenues  respectively  from our customers and distributors outside of the us we expect that international sales will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
the international nature of our business subjects us and our representatives  agents and distributors to laws and regulations of the jurisdictions in which we operate and sell our products 
changes in overseas economic conditions  currency exchange rates  foreign tax laws or tariffs or other trade regulations could have an adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
for example  most of our international sales are denominated in us dollars  us pounds sterling or european currency units 
we do not attempt to reduce the risk of currency fluctuations by hedging 
currency fluctuations against the us dollar could substantially reduce our us dollar revenue 
changes in currency exchange rates could also make the products of our competitors less expensive than ours  which could result in our customers purchasing our competitors products instead of ours 
export controls could prevent us from exporting our products to foreign countries or customers  which could cause our sales to decline and result in continued net losses 
our research  investigational and clinical products are subject to regulation by us department of commerce export controls  primarily as they relate to the associated computers 
these controls could prevent us from exporting our products to certain countries or customers  which could cause our sales to decline and result in continued net losses 
our success depends  in part  on our ability to protect our intellectual property rights 
we could lose sales and our competitive advantage could be harmed if we are not able to prevent infringement of our intellectual property rights 
we rely primarily on trade secret protection and on our unpatented proprietary know how in the development and manufacturing of our products 
our trade secrets or proprietary technology could become known or be independently developed by our competitors 
in addition  the patents we hold may not be sufficiently broad to protect what we believe to be our proprietary rights 
our issued patents could also be disallowed  challenged or circumvented by our competitors 
we cannot assure you that competitors or other parties have not filed or in the future will not file applications for  or have not received or in the future will not receive  patents or obtain additional proprietary rights relating to products or processes used or proposed to be used by us 
in that case  our competitive position could be harmed and we may be required to obtain licenses to patents or proprietary rights of others 
our products could infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  which may lead to costly litigation  lead to payment of substantial damages or royalties and or prevent us from manufacturing and selling our current and future products 
the medical diagnostic equipment industry  in general  is extremely competitive 
litigation among the participants regarding patent and other intellectual property rights is common 
whether or not the litigation has merit  it could be time consuming and expensive for us and divert the attention of our technical and management personnel from other work 
we may be involved in litigation to defend against claims of infringement  to enforce our patent rights or to protect our trade secrets 
if any other party s claims are upheld in any litigation or administrative proceeding  we could be prevented from exploiting the subject matter of those claims or forced to obtain licenses from the patent owners or to redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement 
in the event of any infringement by us  we cannot assure you that we will be able to successfully redesign our products or processes to avoid infringement 
accordingly  an adverse determination in a judicial or administrative proceeding or failure to obtain necessary licenses could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our products and could require us to pay substantial damages and or royalties and or prevent us from manufacturing and selling our current and future products 
our customers rely substantially on the availability of third party reimbursement 
our customers failure to obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors could cause our sales and the future growth of our business to decline 
hospitals  physicians and other health care providers in the us that purchase our products generally rely on third party payors and other sources for reimbursement of health care costs to reimburse all or part of the cost of the procedures in which our products are used 
if hospitals  physicians and other health care providers are unable to obtain adequate reimbursement from third party payors for the procedures in which our products or products currently under development are intended to be used  our sales and future growth of our business could be adversely affected 
market acceptance of our products and products under development in countries outside of the us is also dependent on availability of reimbursement within prevailing health care payment systems in those countries 
reimbursement and health care payment systems in international markets vary significantly by country  and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain international reimbursement approvals in a timely manner  if at all 
failure to receive international reimbursement approvals could harm the market acceptance of our products in the international markets in which such approvals are sought 
we depend on key technical  scientific and management personnel 
any difficulty in retaining our current employees or in hiring new employees could harm our ability to maintain and build our business operations 
our future success depends in significant part upon the continued service of key scientific  technical and management personnel  and our continuing ability to attract and retain highly qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel 
competition for these personnel is intense  and we cannot assure you that we can retain our key scientific  technical and managerial personnel or that we can attract or retain other highly qualified scientific  technical and managerial personnel in the future 
our key employees include carl hull  our president and chief executive officer  barry hotchkies  our chief financial officer  padraig o kelly  our vice president operations and diane oates  our vice president regulatory affairs and quality assurance 
we have taken steps to retain our key employees  including the granting of stock options that vest over time  and we have entered into employment agreements with key employees 
the loss of key personnel  especially if without advanced notice  or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel  could harm our ability to maintain and build our business operations 
furthermore  we have no key man life insurance on any of our key employees 
in addition  some companies have adopted a strategy of suing or threatening to sue former employees and their new employers to discourage those employees from leaving 
as we hire new employees from our current or potential competitors  we may become a party to one or more lawsuits involving our employees 
any future litigation against us or our employees  regardless of the merit or outcome  may result in substantial costs and expenses to us and may divert management s attention away from the operation of our business 
undetected errors or failures in our software could result in loss or delay in the market acceptance for our product  lost sales or costly litigation 
our existing products and products under development involve one or more software components that facilitate the detection of chromosomal  genetic or protein abnormalities through the interaction of certain imaging algorithms with the sample under examination 
this software  including any new versions that may be released  may contain undetected errors or failures 
we cannot assure you that  despite testing by us and our customers  all errors will be found in the software components of our products 
errors in our software could result in loss or delay in the market acceptance for our products  lost sales or costly litigation 
a successful products liability claim brought in excess of our insurance coverage could require us to pay substantial damages and result in harm to our business reputation 
the manufacture and sale of our products involve the risk of product liability claims 
we cannot assure you that the coverage limits of our insurance policies will be adequate in the event we are successfully sued 
we evaluate our coverage limits on a regular basis and in connection with the introduction of products currently under development 
however  liability insurance is expensive and may not be available on commercially reasonably terms  if at all  or in sufficient coverage amounts to cover all eventualities 
a successful claim brought against us in excess of our insurance coverage could require us to pay substantial damages and result in harm to our business reputation 
insiders have substantial control and could delay or prevent a change in corporate control 
some of our stockholders  including some executive officers and directors and their affiliates  own over of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders will  to the extent they act together  have the ability to exert significant influence and control over matters requiring the approval of our stockholders 
their interests may be different from yours 
matters that typically require stockholder approval include i election of directors  ii approval of a merger or consolidation  and iii approval of a sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
accordingly  you may not be able to influence any action we take or consider taking  even if it requires a stockholder vote 
our stock price has been volatile 
it will likely be volatile in the future 
you could lose all or a portion of your investment 
the market prices for securities  generally  and for medical diagnostic instrument companies  in particular  including our common stock  have historically been highly volatile 
investment in our common stock is risky  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
many factors could cause the market price of our stock to fluctuate  perhaps substantially  including the announcement of technological innovations or new products  developments concerning proprietary rights  including patents and litigation matters  publicity regarding actual or potential results with respect to products under development  regulatory developments in the us or other countries  developments in relationships with partners or distributors  public concern as to the safety of new technologies  or changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or our failure to meet those estimates 
in addition  changes in our operating results may cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate 
any future sale of a substantial number of shares eligible for resale could depress the trading price of our stock  lower our value and make it more difficult for us to raise capital 
according to forms d and g filed by our stockholders  approximately  shares of our common stock and warrants representing approximately of the total shares outstanding are held by affiliates and are therefore subject to volume limitations pursuant to rule in the event any of such stockholders ceases to be an affiliate for example  by resigning from the board of directors and holding less than of the shares outstanding  i certain of the shares held by such stockholder will be eligible for immediate resale in the public market and ii pursuant to rule k  certain of such shares will no longer be subject to the manner of sale and volume limitations of rule and will be eligible for resale in the public market after days from the date such stockholder ceases to be an affiliate 
any sale of a substantial number of shares may have the effect of depressing the trading price of our common stock 
in addition  these sales could lower our value and make it more difficult for us to raise capital 
our preferred shares rights plan  certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law contain provisions that could prevent or delay a takeover of applied imaging and negatively impact shareholder value 
on may   we adopted a preferred shares rights plan 
the purpose of the plan is to assure fair value in the event of a future unsolicited business combination or similar transaction involving applied imaging 
if an individual or entity accumulates or solicits a tender or exchange offer for of our common stock  or in the case of special situation funds and affiliates  the rights become exercisable for additional shares of our preferred stock 
the intent of these rights is to encourage a potential acquirer to negotiate with our board of directors to increase the consideration paid for our stock 
the existence of this plan  however  may deter a potential acquirer  which could negatively impact stockholder value 
we also are authorized to issue  shares of undesignated preferred stock  which we may issue without stockholder approval and upon such terms as our board of directors may determine 
in addition  our basic corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover 
any of these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of applied imaging or a change in our management 
the existence of these provisions could adversely affect the voting power of holders of common stock and limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item properties our corporate headquarters are located in an approximately  square foot facility in santa clara  california  under a lease  which terminates on august  in the united kingdom  we lease an approximately  square foot facility in newcastle under a lease that terminates in july  with an option to cancel in july we also lease approximately  square feet in league city  texas that we are in the process of closing

overview the company was founded in to develop  manufacture  and market automated genetic imaging systems for use in cytogenetic laboratories for cancer testing  prenatal testing and other genetic testing applications 
we sell our products to government and private clinical laboratories  research institutions  universities  and pharmaceutical companies located in the united states  canada  europe  japan and other countries 
we also market imaging systems designed for use in plant and animal genetic research programs 
in addition  we have received fda clearance for a clinical system to detect micrometastatic cancer cells in bone marrow from cancer patients 
this system and its research capabilities assists physicians in determining the initial staging of cancer cases  in detecting disease recurrence and in genetically characterizing cancer cells 
we are headquartered in santa clara  california  and have facilities in the united kingdom 
we are the world s leading provider of automated cytogenetic instrument systems 
our products are sold worldwide through a direct sales force  third party distributors and independent sales representatives 
we employ people worldwide 
we have an installed base of over  instruments in over  laboratories and clinics in more than countries 
our cytovision  powergene and quips systems are widely utilized because of their ability to analyze human chromosome preparations using powerful software classification algorithms and a specialized user interface 
these systems also incorporate the capability to analyze and record images produced by advanced genetic research assays that employ fluorescent in situ hybridization fish or comparative genomic hybridization cgh methods 
in  we released two new genetic analysis systems  ariol and spot  that combine with our mds systems to form the oncopath series of systems 
the ariol system is a high throughput system designed to automate and standardize the analysis of immunohistochemistry ihc and fish test results in clinical laboratories 
the ariol system is designed to assist the pathologist and oncologist in their review of key breast cancer ihc tests 
the system is also designed to detect micrometastatic cancer cells that may be found in bone marrow and other clinical samples 
the ariol system is the second generation of the company s pioneering mds system 
the spot genetic analysis system automatically detects and counts fluorescent labeled dna probe signals in cells 
the system is designed for a range of applications  one of which is to assist in the detection of specific genetic abnormalities that identify which patients may respond to new molecularly targeted therapies 
for example  the spot ax system is designed to automate the analysis of a fluorescent dna probe assay that may be a factor in the selection of patients with chronic myelogenous leukemia to receive novartis gleevec therapy 
our mds system combines the ability to find targeted cancer cells using brightfield microscopy techniques with our decade long experience in fluorescence microscopy imaging and analysis 
taken together  these technologies allow us to analyze the proteins on or within a cell while simultaneously assessing which genes within that cell have been activated or expressed 
both protein and gene expression data are emerging as required parameters when assessing the precise nature of a given tumor or cancer cell 
gene expression data are increasingly being used to determine appropriate cancer therapies 
we achieved a number of important operational and financial milestones in sales for the year were a record at million  an increase of over the million recorded in our net loss for the year was  a decrease of million or from the net loss of million recorded in in december  we became aware that some of our sales employees had given verbal undertakings to certain distributors in asia and europe that were not in compliance with our revenue recognition policies 
these verbal undertakings affected a limited number of transactions beginning in december on further investigation  we determined that these verbal undertakings  had they been known at the time  would have served to defer the recognition of the related revenue by  generally  one or two quarters 
the impact of the revenue deferral on our previously issued financial statements is to i reduce revenue in the fourth quarter and full year by  reduce revenue in the first quarter of by  increase revenue in the second quarter of by  and reduce revenue in the third quarter of by  and ii increase the net loss in the fourth quarter and full year by  increase the net loss in the first quarter of by  increase the net profit in the second quarter of by  and reduce the net profit in the third quarter of by  there was also a small impact on inventories  accounts receivables and deferred revenue in the quarters under discussion 
while we concluded that the impact of the revenue recognition matter on each quarter in question was not necessarily material  we decided to restate our financial results for fiscal year and the first three quarters of fiscal the restated quarterly financial information is shown in the footnote quarterly financial data unaudited in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
we have revised our internal controls and procedures related to revenue recognition 
some of our new internal controls and procedures include requiring sub certifications from all sales managers and officers regarding revenue recognition  additional communication to sales employees to reinforce our revenue recognition policy  clarification of certain parts of our revenue recognition policy  and requiring a counter signature by the chief financial officer of significant sales orders 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past on an annual and quarterly basis 
we expect that operating results will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter and year to year in the future and will depend on a number of factors 
these factors include  but are not limited to  demand for our products  release and acceptance of new systems and new applications  timing of capital equipment orders and shipments  competition and its related pricing pressures  and seasonal factors  many of which are outside of our control 
results of operations fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this reflected a revenue increase of in north america and an increase of in the rest of the world 
growth in sales in north america was due primarily to the unit growth in the oncopath series of products 
the slower growth experienced in the rest of the world was due to the impact of phasing out one of our genetics systems approximately million and the completion of a grant program that had generated  of revenue in and no revenue in for and revenues derived outside of north america were approximately and of total revenues  respectively  reflecting the growth in north american system sales during and the slower growth in the rest of the world markets discussed previously 
we expect that our oncopath systems may be the primary driver of our future sales growth 
sales of systems were million in  an increase of over the million achieved in  primarily due to unit growth in north american markets discussed previously 
software maintenance  service contract and grant revenues at million in increased from the million recorded in excluding the impact of the completion of the grant program discussed previously  service contract revenues increased by to million in from million in  primarily due to growth in service contract revenues reflecting the increased emphasis placed on marketing service contracts to our customers 
grant proceeds were zero in compared to  in grant revenues fluctuate based on the completion of programs  with revenue being recognized as the work is performed 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues includes direct material and labor costs  manufacturing overhead  warranty related expenses and post warranty service and application support expenses 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in the lower costs as a percent of revenues are due to reduced manufacturing costs primarily lower material costs of components such as personal computers  monitors and flat panel displays and the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in santa clara  california that was completed in the first quarter of cost of system revenues increased from million in to million in or by and as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in due primarily to reduced manufacturing costs and the consolidation of manufacturing facilities discussed previously 
cost of service contract  software maintenance and grant revenues increased from million in to million in or by and as a percentage of revenues was in  the same level as in grant revenues did not have a significant impact on cost of revenues in either or research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in  or by due primarily to the consolidation of software support operations in january that resulted in the elimination of five personnel positions 
research and development costs were of total revenues in compared to of total revenues in sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in  or by 
sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues were in and in the decrease is primarily related to reduced international sales expenses reflecting a reduced number of personnel 
included in the sales and marketing expenses for was  for the termination of an under performing sales distributor in europe 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in  a decrease of 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative costs were of total revenues in compared to of total revenues in the reduction in the absolute dollar amount of spending and percentage of sales ratio is due primarily to reduced expenditures on our investor relations program  and consulting  amortization of goodwill 
amortization of goodwill amounted to  for with no such expenses in with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets in  our goodwill is no longer being amortized in the amortization expenses in represent the amortization of goodwill resulting from the acquisition of the cytogenetic imaging business of vysis  inc in july and the acquisition of the united states based powergene business of perceptive scientific instruments  llc in july restructuring costs 
restructuring costs amounted to  in with no such costs in in january  we instituted a series of actions to rationalize our operations to provide a lower operating cost while increasing efficiencies 
we are closing our league city  texas office and have consolidated our manufacturing and engineering facilities 
we recorded a restructuring charge of  in that was due to the costs of terminating employees  five employees in engineering  three in manufacturing  two in administration and two in sales and support and closing the league city  texas office  other income expense  net 
the increase in other expense from  in to  in was due primarily to the increase in net interest expense from  in to  in reflecting an increase in our borrowings that were million at the end of compared to million at the end of fiscal compared with fiscal revenues 
revenues increased to million in from million in  an increase of 
this reflected a revenue increase of in north america and a decrease of in the rest of the world 
sales  particularly in north america  benefited from the purchase of the powergene instrument business from international remote imaging systems  inc on july  as a result  we had a full year of powergene sales in compared to six months in that provided an additional million and million of revenues  in north america and the rest of the world  respectively 
in addition  sales in north america benefited from growth in our base cytogenetic markets million  excluding the increase in powergene revenues noted above and related service revenues million 
for and revenues derived outside of north america were approximately and of total revenues  respectively  reflecting the growth in north american instrument and service sales during discussed previously 
we expect that the oncopath systems may be the primary driver of our future sales growth sales of systems were million in  an increase of over the million achieved in  primarily due to growth in north american markets 
service contract  software maintenance and grant revenues at million in increased from the million recorded in primarily due to growth in service contract revenues that amounted to million in compared to million in  reflecting the increased emphasis placed on marketing service contracts to our customers 
in addition  grant proceeds amounted to  in compared to  in grant revenues fluctuate based on the completion of milestones for existing programs  with revenue being recognized as the work is performed 
cost of revenues 
cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues was in compared to in the lower costs as a percent of revenues are due to reduced manufacturing costs primarily lower material costs of components such as personal computers  monitors and flat panel displays and the increase in grant revenues discussed above 
cost of system revenues decreased from million in to million in or by and as a percentage of revenues from in to in due primarily to reduced manufacturing costs 
cost of service contract  software maintenance and grant revenues increased from million in to million in or by and as a percentage of revenues decreased from in to in due primarily to the addition of personnel in the service function 
grant revenues did not have a significant impact on cost of revenues in either or research and development expenses 
research and development expenses of million in increased approximately million  or  from levels 
the increase is primarily due to increased personnel and consulting expenses related to the development of new applications for the mds system and the development of a second generation mds system as we focus our product development efforts on the cancer research and cancer pathology markets 
research and development costs were of total revenues in both and sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  or by 
in and sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues were and  respectively 
the increase in spending in is due primarily to an increase in sales personnel million and marketing expenses million related to the introduction of the new mds applications  and higher commission expenses million as a result of increased sales in north america 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses in amounted to million compared to million in  a decrease of 
as a percentage of revenue  general and administrative costs were of total revenues for compared to of total revenues in the reduction in the absolute dollar amount of spending and percentage of sales ratio is due to our continued focus on cost control 
we instituted controls on discretionary expenses such as travel down  from to as well as selected salary reductions that resulted in a  reduction in compensation expenses from to there were also limited one time operational costs in  related to the post acquisition integration of the us based powergene business acquired from perceptive scientific instruments  llc in july amortization of goodwill 
amortization expense amounted to  in and  in amortization expense relates to the amortization of the intangible assets that included goodwill and intellectual and software property in connection with our acquisition of the cytogenetic imaging business of vysis inc on july  and the powergene product line on july  the increase in versus is due to the inclusion of a full year of amortization related to the powergene acquisition in compared to six months amortization in other income expense  net 
in  other expense amounted to  compared to other expense of  in this reduction of  in when compared to the prior year is due primarily to reduced foreign currency exchange losses due to the strengthening of the us dollar versus the pound sterling and other foreign currencies that occurred primarily in the first quarter of there was a swing from net interest income in of  to a net interest expense in of  primarily reflecting a lower cash and investment position in factors that might affect future results we have experienced significant fluctuations in our quarterly operating results in the past  and we expect to experience fluctuations in the future 
our customers  who are primarily public and private clinical laboratories  research organizations and hospitals  generally operate on annual budgets 
their spending practices  business cycles and budgeting cycles affect our revenues 
factors that may have an influence on our operating results in any particular quarter include demand for our products  seasonality of our sales  new product introductions by us or our competitors  and the costs and time required for a transition to the new products  timing of orders and shipments for capital equipment sales  our mix of sales between our distributors and our direct sales force  competition including pricing pressures  timing and amount of research and development expenses including clinical trial related expenditures  foreign currency fluctuations  delays between our incurrence of expenses to develop new products including expenses related to marketing and service capabilities  and the timing of sales and payments received for the new products and the uncertainty of fda or other domestic and international regulatory clearances or approvals 
due to the factors noted above  our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
it is possible that our future operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if our operating results fall below market expectations  the price of our common stock could decline significantly 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents  restricted cash and short term investments of million compared to million at december  we maintain our cash equivalents primarily in securities with maturities of days or less 
restricted cash  which collateralizes various credit and bank guarantees in the united kingdom  amounted to  at december  compared to  at december  the reduction in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in was due primarily to increases in inventory and accounts receivable following sales growth 
working capital amounted to million at december  compared to million at december  cash used in operations for the year ended december  was million compared to million for the million decrease in cash used in operations was primarily due to a million reduction in the operating loss for the year discussed above and a million increase in the needs for accrued expenses an increase of  in compared to a decrease of million in these were partially offset by increased requirements for accounts receivables of million an increase of million in versus a decrease of million in and for inventories of million an increase of  in versus a decrease of  reflecting increased sales 
the increase in accrued expenses is due primarily to increased accruals for compensation  and audit legal 
trade accounts receivable as a percent of fourth quarter sales were in compared to in and in this strong relationship between year end receivables and last quarter sales is primarily due to the fact that most of our sales occur late in the quarter as is typical of capital equipment businesses 
although our payment terms are net days  our customers  specifically government  university  japanese  chinese and european customers tend to take longer to pay their receivable balances 
we do not experience significant collection issues with our accounts  but many of our customers take longer than the stated day payment period 
at december   approximately of the receivables were outstanding for greater than days and at december   approximately were older than days 
cash used in investing activities was  in compared to  in this change was primarily due to a decrease in our short term investments of  in versus a decrease of  in this was partially offset by an increase in the amount we invested for purchases of capital equipment to  in compared to  in cash provided by financing activities was million in compared to  in we received million from the issuance of common stock in primarily from a private placement of our common stock in january  compared to  in  primarily from the exercise of employee stock options 
bank debt increased by  in to fund our working capital requirements compared to a decrease in bank and other loans in of million that included the repayment of a loan from vysis  inc of  in restricted cash was reduced by  in compared to a reduction of million in we had restricted cash at december  of million  representing cash collateralizing our bank loans 
this was reduced to  at the end of as we entered into new loan agreements in on january   we completed a private placement of  shares of our common stock to an institutional investor purchasing for three separate funds at a purchase price of per share 
additional shares may be issuable to the investors under provisions contained in the stock purchase agreement between the investors and us  which we filed with the securities exchange commission on form s on october   as amended 
on july   each investor received a warrant exercisable for the number of shares of our common stock equal to the number of shares of common stock purchased by that investor in the january  financing 
a total of  warrants were issued 
the warrants are exercisable for four years from july  at a price of per share 
all of the warrants remain outstanding as of december  on december   we completed a private placement of million with the sale of  shares of our common stock to two institutional investors purchasing for five separate funds at a purchase price of per share 
the company received proceeds of million from the private placement net of issuance costs of million 
warrants were also issued to the investors entitling them to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at an exercise price of per share 
additional shares and warrants may be issuable to the investors under anti dilution provisions of the stock purchase agreement between the company and the investors  and terms of the warrants issued to the investors 
no such additional shares or warrants have been issued 
all of the warrants remain outstanding as of december  on july  we acquired the united states based genetic imaging business of psi from international remote imaging systems  inc iris 
the consideration paid was  shares of common stock valued at  the assumption of certain liabilities  and potential future cash payments to a maximum of million based on the future performance of the business 
we paid  to iris in and no such performance payments were paid in and in november  we raised million of additional equity via a private placement of one million shares of our common stock at a price of per share 
the investors also entered into an exclusive distribution agreement for the company s products 
the price exceeded the closing price of our common stock as reported on the nasdaq national market system 
as part of the private placement  we recognized deferred revenue of  to be amortized over months  the term of the distribution agreement 
as of december   the remaining balance of the deferred revenue as a result of this private placement was  we had a   gross and   net unsecured revolving line of credit with an international bank in the united kingdom that expired on march  the line of credit was guaranteed by the us corporation 
the international bank subsequently provided us with a   gross and net zero borrowing facility with various renewals through october  the line of credit expired at that time and we had no loans under that facility at december  we collateralized various credit card and bank guarantees used for customs clearance purposes with cash deposits at the international bank amounting to   at december  in september  we established a million  three year term loan with silicon valley bank svb 
the loan had monthly principal payments of  plus interest at svb prime rate plus one and a quarter percent 
in june  we expanded the loan agreement to include a  revolving line of credit 
we executed a new loan agreement with svb on september  this new facility replaced the three year term loan and the revolving line of credit that had an outstanding balance of million on september  the new loan agreement provided the capability to borrow up to million based on the level of certain of our north american accounts receivable and inventories 
on august  and on october   the loan agreement was amended to extend the term of the loan for an additional year  through september   to increase borrowing capability to million based on the level of certain of our north american accounts receivable and to increase the requirement for us to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth 
at december  we had used  of the facility with  available but not used 
the interest rate on the facility was at december   computed as the svb prime rate plus percent 
the loan is collateralized by substantially all of the assets of the us corporation and requires us to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth amounting to million at december  other loan covenants include the need to maintain insurance on our property  monthly reporting to svb  the need to obtain svb approval for any extraordinary action and a limitation on the us corporation s ability to transfer more than  to a subsidiary 
we were not in compliance with the covenant requiring us to maintain million in minimum tangible net worth at december  and we have subsequently obtained a waiver for this covenant violation 
in july  we acquired certain cytogenetic instrumentation assets of vysis  inc total consideration paid was  consisting of  shares of the company s common stock  a cash payment of one million dollars and installment payments of  paid july  and  paid january  since our formation in july through december  we have generated an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect negative cash flow from operations to continue through at least  as we continue the development of our oncopath system  conduct clinical trials required for fda clearance of new products  expand our marketing  sales and customer support capabilities  and add additional administrative infrastructure 
in january  we instituted a series of actions to rationalize our operations to provide a lower operating cost while increasing efficiencies 
we believe that our capital resources will enable us to meet our short term capital needs through at least however  expenditures required to achieve growth and profitability in the long term may be greater than projected or the cash flow generated from operations may be less than projected 
as a result  our long term capital needs may require us to seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources 
we have expended and will continue to expend substantial amounts of money for research and development  preclinical testing  planned clinical investigations  capital expenditures  working capital needs and manufacturing and marketing of our products 
our future research and development efforts  in particular  are expected to include development of additional applications of our current cytogenetic products and additional applications for the oncopath system  which will likely require additional funds 
the exact timing and amount of spending required cannot be accurately determined and will depend on several factors  including progress of our research and development efforts and planned clinical investigations  competing technological and market developments  commercialization of products currently under development by us and our competitors  and market acceptance and demand for our products 
to the extent necessary  we may seek to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  collaborative or other arrangements with other companies  bank financing and other sources 
if we raise funds by issuing equity securities  you will experience dilution of your holdings in our common stock 
we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
if adequate and acceptable financing is not available  we may have to delay development or commercialization of certain of our products or license to third parties the rights to commercialize certain of our products or technologies that we would otherwise seek to commercialize 
we may also reduce our marketing  customer support or other resources devoted to certain of our products 
any of these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
future payments due under debt and lease obligations as of december  is as follows in thousands bank loans operating leases total critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial position and results of operations is based on our financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
this requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we recognize revenue on product sales upon shipment  provided that  at the time of shipment  there is evidence of contractual arrangement with the customer  the fee is fixed and determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and there are no significant remaining obligations 
concurrent with shipment  we accrue for expected hardware warranty expenses and establish reserves  based on our historical experience  for product returns 
we establish an accounts receivable allowance for estimated amounts that may not be collectible from customers 
when the company sells products to distributors  it recognizes revenue at the time of shipment  net of any discount  provided that there is evidence of contractual arrangement with the distributor  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the resulting receivable is probable and there are no significant remaining obligations 
the distributor agreements do not provide a right of return 
revenue attributable to software maintenance and support is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance agreement  generally one year 
grant revenues are recognized as the work is performed 
we use the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amount of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
we have not recorded an income tax benefit in  and due to the recording of a valuation allowance as an offset to net deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is provided due to uncertainties surrounding the realization of deferred tax assets due to our history of operating losses

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivatives and financial instruments foreign currency hedging instruments we transact business in various foreign currencies 
accordingly  we are subject to exposure from adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
this exposure is primarily related to revenues and operating expenses in the uk denominated in the respective local currency 
we currently do not use financial instruments to hedge operating expenses in the u 
k 
denominated in the respective local currency 
instead  we believe that a natural partial hedge exits  because local currency revenues will substantially offset the operating expenses denominated in the respective local currency 
we assess the need to utilize financial instruments to hedge currency exposure on an ongoing basis 
we did not engage in hedging activities in and and  as of december   we had no hedging contracts outstanding 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative trading purposes  nor do we hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that entirely offsets the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates 
we regularly review our hedging program and may as a part of this review determine at any time to change our hedging program 
fixed income investments our exposure to market risks due to changes in interest rates relates primarily to investments in debt securities issued by us government agencies and corporate debt securities 
our general policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
we place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of the credit exposure to any one issuer 
all highly liquid investments with maturity of three months or less at the date of purchase are considered to be cash equivalents and not subject to interest rate risks 
investments with maturities over three months and less than one year are considered to be short term investments 
at december  we did not have any short term investments
