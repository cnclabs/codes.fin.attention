see also cautionary statements regarding forward looking statements in part i of this report 
general after reaching peak business levels in the first half of fiscal year  the registrant experienced a rapid decline in sales volume  as did the entire electronic component industry  due to a drastic slowdown in the wireless infrastructure and fiber optic markets 
after bottoming out in the second quarter of fiscal year  sales have rebounded modestly 
however  demand from the wireless infrastructure and fiber optics markets remains depressed 
sales for fiscal year were essentially level with fiscal year in response to the industry downturn  the registrant instituted a series of cost reduction measures in the second half of fiscal year the measures included headcount reduction  spending control measures and the closure of the registrant s sales office in england  among others 
additionally  certain inventory was written down to net realizable value and excess palladium was sold at a significant loss in fiscal year current year losses have declined primarily as a result of these cost reduction measures 
most recently  the registrant has selectively added personnel in order to improve customer service and build for the future 
the registrant has developed new products which  to some extent  have helped to offset the decreased business 
many of these new products sell into the same markets as the registrant s traditional products and  as such  the benefits of the newer products has been limited 
as product demand increases  the registrant expects to benefit from sales volume improvement from traditional products and also from products that have been introduced during the past two years 
demand improvement will largely depend on increased capital expenditures in the markets the registrant serves 
many of the customers the registrant serves have begun to use facilities in asia to build their product 
production and major new technology infrastructure projects have shifted into this region 
china is a growing market and the chinese government continues to spend significant money on encouraging the growth of the electronic components industry 
the registrant has responded by opening its first sales office in the far east in china 
based upon its experience in europe  the registrant believes that maintaining a local sales office will enable it to remain in close contact with its customers and strengthen relationships with the major manufacturers in the region 
the registrant expects that bookings will be flat throughout the remainder of the calendar year and will gradually increase thereafter 
the increases are anticipated to be in part from an increase in orders due to an economic recovery and in part due to sales of new product offerings which the registrant has recently introduced 
there can be no assurance  however  concerning the timing of an economic recovery  if any  or the level of acceptance of any of the registrant s new products 
results of operations fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales for the fiscal year ended june  were  a decrease of from the  recorded in the fiscal year ended june  domestic sales decreased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year international sales increased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year although overall sales remained at levels comparable to the prior year  there was an increase in sales of larger case size capacitors and eia case capacitors and a decline in sales of thin film products 
the increase in foreign sales is indicative of the registrant s customers migrating production overseas  penetration into the asian market and improved sales in europe 
orders have improved significantly from the lows experienced in the second quarter of fiscal year total bookings in fiscal year were  compared to  in fiscal year  representing an increase of approximately 
growth has come from the military and wireless infrastructure markets offset partially by a decrease in orders from the medical electronics market 
gross margins were of net sales in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the increase in gross margins was attributable in part to cost reduction measures implemented by the registrant in fiscal year in response to the industry downturn and increased precious metal recovery  as well as the lack of inventory write downs to net realizable value and a loss on the sale of palladium a precious metal used in the manufacture of certain core products both of which occurred in fiscal in june  the registrant sold a portion of its palladium inventory to align inventory levels with anticipated demand 
the registrant believes its current level of inventory is appropriate for current sales and production levels 
operating expenses totaled  or of net sales  in fiscal year  compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal year the decrease in operating expenses from the prior fiscal year was attributable to decreased staff as a result of the cost reduction measures discussed above  lower severance costs and other restructuring costs  and decreased research and development spending 
operating expenses also decreased as a percentage of sales for the same reasons 
net interest expense was  in fiscal year  compared to net interest expense of  in fiscal year the decrease in net interest expense was attributable primarily to the retiring of all outstanding bank debt in the first quarter of fiscal year the effective income tax benefit rate for fiscal year was approximately  as compared to for fiscal year the increase in the effective income tax rate was primarily due to the impact of foreign tax benefits in relation to the low level of pre tax loss 
as a result of the foregoing  the registrant reported a net loss of  or 
per common and diluted share  for fiscal year  compared to a net loss of  or per common and diluted share  for fiscal year fiscal year compared with fiscal year net sales for the fiscal year ended june  were  a decrease of from the  recorded in the fiscal year ended june  domestic sales decreased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year international sales decreased by to  in fiscal year from  in fiscal year the decrease in total net sales resulted primarily from a decrease in demand for the registrant s products in both foreign and domestic markets across virtually all product lines 
following the dramatic decrease in orders in the second half of fiscal year  orders remained low throughout fiscal year although the rate of cancellations has returned to historical levels  the registrant has not experienced any significant increase in order levels 
total bookings in fiscal year were  compared to  in fiscal year  representing a decline of approximately 
orders from customers in the wireless infrastructure  fiber optic and semiconductor manufacturing equipment markets remain significantly below the levels obtained in the first half of fiscal year these customers are heavily dependent on activity in the telecommunications industry which remains depressed 
accordingly  it is unclear when orders may be expected to increase 
the registrant has responded to the decrease in business levels by instituting a series of cost reduction initiatives 
during fiscal year  the registrant implemented a series of workforce reductions  scaled back its research and development efforts and significantly reduced capital spending 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  the registrant sold a large portion of its palladium raw material inventory that it deemed to be excess based on anticipated business levels for million 
the registrant recognized a loss of  after tax  or 
per share  during the fourth quarter of fiscal year as a result of this transaction 
gross margins were of net sales in fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year the decrease in gross margins was primarily attributable to lower sales in relation to fixed costs  the loss on the sale of palladium  inventory write downs to net realizable value as a result of excess quantities  customer requirements and other causes  and a reduction of benefits from reclaiming activity  offset partially by the net effect of the workforce reductions and other cost controls discussed above 
operating expenses totaled  or of net sales  in fiscal year  compared to  or of net sales  in fiscal year the decrease in operating expenses from the prior fiscal year was attributable to decreased staff as a result of the cost reduction measures discussed above  lower commissions related to the lower sales volume  lower bonus accruals due to decreased profitability  and decreased research and development spending  partially offset by severance costs and other restructuring costs of approximately  as a percentage of sales  operating expenses increased due to the lower level of sales and the fixed nature of certain expenses 
net interest expense was  in fiscal year  compared to net interest expense of  in fiscal year the increase in net interest expense was attributable to decreased interest income due to lower prevailing interest rates  offset partially by an increase in cash available for investing and lower interest expense on loans 
the effective income tax benefit rate for fiscal year was approximately  as compared to an effective income tax rate of for fiscal year the increase in the effective income tax rate was due to operating losses and the impact of certain credits 
as a result of the foregoing  the registrant reported a net loss of  or 
per common share and per common share assuming dilution  for fiscal year  compared to net income of  or per common share per common share assuming dilution  for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources the registrant s financial position at june  remains strong as evidenced by working capital of  compared to working capital of  at june  the registrant s current ratio at june  was  compared to at june  the registrant s quick ratio at june  increased to  compared to at june  the improvement in the current and quick ratios were primarily due to the retiring of the registrant s bank debt in july and positive cash flows from operations in excess of capital expenditures 
cash and investments increased to  at june   compared to  at june  the increase in cash and investments was primarily the result of positive cash flow from operations in excess of capital expenditures and collection of tax refunds partially offset by the retiring of the bank debt 
accounts receivable increased by  to  at june   compared to  at june  inventories decreased by  to  at june   compared to  at june  the registrant continues to maintain high finished goods inventory levels to keep customer lead times to a minimum and maintain good customer service 
other current assets decreased by  primarily due to the collection of income tax receivables as a result of losses incurred in fiscal current portion of long term debt decreased  to  at june  compared to  at june  the decrease in the current portion of long term debt was due to the retiring of the bank debt in the first quarter of fiscal year accounts payable increased by  to  at june   compared to  at june  accrued expenses decreased by  to  at june   compared to  at june  the registrant leases its facility in jacksonville  florida from a partnership controlled by the registrant s president  chief executive officer and principal stockholder under a capital lease 
the rental payments under this lease have been adjusted several times  most recently as of september  primarily to reflect certain additions to the facility and market value adjustments as required by the terms of the lease based upon independent appraisals 
see item properties 
effective september   the registrant is obligated to pay approximately  per annum under this lease  an increase from  per annum during fiscal year the payments due over the remaining seven years of this capital lease  including the portion related to interest  total approximately  see item certain relationships and related transactions and note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
at june   the registrant had available two credit facilities with bank of america  na bank of america a  revolving line of credit against which no borrowings were incurred  and an  equipment line of credit against which the registrant had borrowings of  outstanding 
both lines bore interest at above the one month libor rate  or approximately at june  the outstanding principal balance of the equipment line rolled over periodically into a self amortizing term note of not less than four nor more than seven years 
each of these credit facilities was subject to certain financial covenants  including maintenance of asset and liability percentage ratios 
one such covenant required the registrant to maintain a certain level of annualized earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda to current debt plus annual interest payments 
due to the losses incurred by the registrant during fiscal year  the registrant was not in compliance with this covenant 
the registrant held discussions with bank of america concerning possible amendments to the terms of these facilities which proved to be unsuccessful 
accordingly  in july  the registrant repaid the outstanding balance of the equipment facility and terminated both of these facilities 
the registrant is in the process of seeking a line of credit or other form of financing for planned purchases of equipment 
if the registrant is unable to secure such financing on acceptable terms  the registrant believes that it will be able to fund such purchases from cash on hand and cash generated from operations 
capital expenditures for the fiscal year ended june  totaled  including expenditures for machinery and equipment and planned leasehold improvements 
the registrant intends to use cash on hand  cash generated through operations  and available credit  if any  to finance budgeted capital expenditures  primarily for equipment acquisition  of approximately  in fiscal year aggregate contractual obligations as of june  mature as follows payments due by period in s less than after contractual obligations total year years years years bank debt capital lease obligations    operating leases   total contractual obligations    as described above  in july  the registrant repaid the outstanding balance of its equipment line from bank of america 
accordingly  the registrant currently has no outstanding long term bank debt  or available committed lines of credit 
the registrant routinely enters into binding and non binding purchase obligations in the ordinary course of business  primarily covering anticipated purchases of inventory and equipment 
the terms of these commitments generally do not extend beyond six months 
none of these obligations are individually significant 
the registrant does not expect that these commitments will materially adversely affect its liquidity in the foreseeable future 
critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission sec issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require the application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the registrant s significant accounting policies are described in note to its consolidated financial statements contained in item financial statements and supplementary data of this report 
the registrant believes that the following accounting policies require the application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments allowances for doubtful accounts receivable the registrant performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and a customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by its review of the customer s current credit information 
the registrant continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains an allowance for estimated credit losses based upon its historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that the registrant has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the registrant s expectations and the allowances established  the registrant cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has in the past 
should the financial position of its customers deteriorate resulting in an impairment of their ability to pay amounts due  the registrant s revised estimate of such losses and any actual losses in excess of previous estimates may negatively impact its operating results 
sales returns and allowances in the ordinary course of business  the registrant accepts returns of products sold for various reasons and grants sales allowances to customers 
while the registrant engages in extensive product quality control programs and processes  its level of sales returns is affected by  among other things  the quality of its manufacturing process 
the registrant maintains an allowance for sales returns and allowances based upon historical returns and allowances granted 
while such returns and allowances have historically been within the registrant s expectations  actual return and allowance rates in the future may differ from current estimates  which could negatively impact its operating results 
inventory valuation the registrant values inventory at the lower of aggregate cost first in  first out or market 
when the cost of inventory is determined by management to be in excess of its market value  such inventory is written down to its estimated net realizable value 
this requires the registrant to make estimates and assumptions about several factors eg  future sales quantities and selling prices  and percentage complete and failure rates for work in process based upon historical experience and its projections for future periods 
changes in factors such as the level of order bookings  the product mix of order bookings and the registrant s manufacturing processes could have a material impact on the registrant s assessment of the net realizable value of inventory in the future 
valuation of deferred tax assets the registrant regularly evaluates its ability to recover the reported amount of its deferred income taxes considering several factors  including its estimate of the likelihood of the registrant generating sufficient taxable income in future years during the period over which temporary differences reverse 
presently  the registrant believes that it is more likely than not that it will realize the benefits of its deferred tax assets based primarily on its history of and projections for taxable income in the future  and its intention to carry back net operating losses to generate refunds of income taxes previously paid 
in the event that actual results differ from its estimates or the registrant adjusts these estimates in future periods  the registrant may need to establish a valuation allowance against a portion or all of its deferred tax assets  which could materially impact its financial position or results of operations in future periods 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets the registrant assesses the recoverability of long lived assets whenever the registrant determines that events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
its assessment is primarily based upon its estimate of future cash flows associated with these assets 
the registrant believes that the carrying amount of its long lived assets is recoverable 
however  should its operating results deteriorate  or anticipated new product launches not occur or not attain the commercial acceptance that the registrant anticipates  the registrant may determine that some portion of its long lived assets are impaired 
such determination could result in non cash charges to income that could materially affect its financial position or results of operations for that period 
inflation the registrant does not expect the effects of inflation to have a significant impact on its liquidity or results of operations 
accounting standards issued but not yet adopted in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transaction and disclosure sfas no 
 an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of fasb statement to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
the registrant adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
effective  january  the registrant continued to apply the intrinsic value based method to account for stock options through fiscal year in july  the registrant elected to transition to a fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the registrant will use the prospective method for the transition as permitted by sfas under the prospective method  stock compensation expense for new awards will be recognized for any new option grants or stock awards granted on or after july  based upon the award s fair value 
outstanding stock options granted prior to july   will continue to be accounted for under the intrinsic value method 
stock compensation expense for new awards will be calculated using the black scholes pricing model to estimate fair value 
the adoption of this standard will increase recognized stock compensation expense to the extent stock options or awards are granted after june  in january  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin no 

previously  consolidation of variable interest entities was largely based on controlling voting rights 
this interpretation clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to entities where the company is vulnerable to a majority of the entity s risk of loss or is entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns even if there is no controlling voting interest 
the registrant will adopt fin no 
effective july  the registrant is currently assessing the impact of the adoption of fin no 
on its financial position and consolidated results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the registrant has identified three market risks relative to its business foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk and security price risk 
the registrant has managed its market risk exposures in order to minimize their potential impact on its consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
specifically a foreign currency exchange rate risk 
with the exception of sales by the registrant s wholly owned subsidiary in sweden which are denominated in krona  all transactions are  and are anticipated to be  denominated in us dollars 
at the present time  the contribution of the swedish subsidiary to the registrant s consolidated results of operations is not significant 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
accordingly  fluctuations in exchange rates would not presently have a material adverse effect on the registrant s operations 
b commodity price risk 
the registrant uses certain precious metals in the manufacturing of its products primarily palladium and gold  and is therefore subject to certain commodity price risks 
the registrant believes that  based upon its current levels of production and inventories of palladium and gold  it will need to buy additional quantities of palladium during the next fiscal year at prevailing market prices 
additionally  the registrant believes that the price of palladium and gold will remain stable due to the lower demand coming from the electronics industry 
if prices were to begin rising significantly  the registrant may decide to purchase a longer term supply of the metals to protect against unstable pricing 
c security price risk 
the registrant s current portfolio of marketable securities consists of us treasury notes and other government securities with varying maturities of up to three years 
the registrant believes it can effectively manage any exposure resulting from declining prices by holding any securities which decline substantially in value until maturity
