item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes that are in item of this document 
business general we directly or through contractors  design  manufacture  sell  and service information technology and audio surveillance technology products through two major business segments 
these two business segments are the transportation communications segment  and the law enforcement and surveillance segment 
while service is a significant aspect of our marketing strategy  it is not yet a material generator of revenue and was approximately to of net sales for the years ended december   and our transportation communications segment produces products sold worldwide within the passenger information communication industry and market 
we transact our sales with transportation vehicle equipment customers generally in two broad categories 
those categories are firstly end customers including municipalities  regional transportation districts  federal  state  and local departments of transportation  transit agencies  public  private  or commercial operators of such vehicles  and rental car agencies  and secondly  original equipment manufacturers oem of those vehicles 
the relative percentage of sales to end customers as compared to oem customers varies widely and frequently from period to period and within products and product lines comprising our mix of total revenue in any given period 
our law enforcement and surveillance segment serves customers in the us federal  state  and local law enforcement agencies or organizations  as well as their counterparts abroad 
we produce a line of digital audio filter systems and tape transcribers used to improve the quality and intelligibility of both live and recorded voices 
we market our law enforcement and surveillance products domestically and internationally to law enforcement entities and other customers in or support of government organizations 
sales to our customers are characterized by a lengthy sales cycle that generally extends for a period of two to months 
in addition  purchases by a majority of our customers are dependent upon federal  state and local funding that may vary from year to year and quarter to quarter 
we recognize product revenue upon shipment of products to customers and service revenue upon completion of the service 
because our operations are characterized by significant research and development expenses preceding product introduction  net sales and certain related expenses may not be recorded in the same period  thereby producing fluctuations in operating results 
our dependence upon large contracts and orders  as well as upon a small number of relatively large customers or projects  increases the magnitude of fluctuations in operating results particularly on a period to period  or period over period  comparison basis 
for a more complete description of our business  including a description of our products  sales cycle and research and development  see item business 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are discussed in note and of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the following is a listing of the company s critical accounting policies and a brief discussion of each allowance for doubtful accounts inventory valuation intangible assets and goodwill income taxes  including deferred tax assets revenue recognition allowance for doubtful accounts 
our allowance for doubtful accounts relate to trade accounts receivable 
it reflects our estimate of the amount of our outstanding accounts receivable that are not likely to be collected for one reason or another 
most of the company sales are to large oem equipment manufacturers or to state or local governmental units or authorities  so management s expectation of losses from true collectibility problems resulting from insolvency or actual inability to pay are very low 
however  we also include amounts in the allowance for doubtful accounts when the credit of the customer may not be at issue  but a dispute exists over precise purchase order or invoice terms or quality of the product or service 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is an estimate prepared by management based upon identification of the collectibility of specific accounts and the overall condition of the receivable portfolios 
we analyze our trade receivables  the customer relationships underlying the receivables  historical bad debts  customer credits  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms  when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
also  if we conclude that a disagreement or dispute has arisen with a customer over products or services provided on account  we may add to our allowance for doubtful accounts 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to collect more of our receivables than previously esti mated  an adjustment to the allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is reviewed periodically and adjustments are recorded as deemed necessary 
our allowance for doubtful accounts will generally increase or decrease in the future as our sales increase or decrease 
we do not expect our allowance for doubtful accounts to increase or decrease  materially  as a percentage of sales  in coming years as a result of any trends in the credit worthiness of our customers or as a result of an increase or decrease in disputes with customers regarding the terms of purchase orders or invoices or acceptability of the products or services 
however  to the extent that our sales in parts of the world  such as the middle east  south america or africa  increase as a percentage of all sales  our allowance for doubtful accounts may also increase relative to sales to reflect the lower credit quality of governmental or publicly funded entities in those areas and the general instability of certain parts of those regions 
in  our allowance for doubtful accounts increased to  from  for this increase of was greater than the increase in net sales over the same period and does not relate to any general trend 
the company makes its evaluation on facts and circumstances related to specific customers 
inventory valuation 
we periodically evaluate the carrying amount of inventory based upon the identification of inventory to achieve current shipping forecasts and provide sufficient inventory to meet both warranty and post warranty component requirements 
the company  as a part of the sale  typically extends a warranty term generally ranging from years 
the company accounts for this liability through a warranty reserve on the balance sheet 
additionally  in special situations  the company may  solely at its discretion  use post warranty services as a marketing tool 
in these instances  the expense is treated as a period cost and is in all respects discretionary 
many of our customers have contractual or legal requirements which dictate an extended period of time for us to maintain replacement parts 
our evaluation involves a multi element approach incorporating inventory turnover and the stratification of inventory by risk category  among other elem ents 
the approach incorporates both recent historical information and management estimates of trends 
our approach is intended to take into consideration potential excess and obsolescence in relation to our installed base  engineering changes  uses for components in other products  return rights with vendors and end of manufacture 
if any of the elements of our estimate were to deteriorate  additional write downs may be required 
the inventory write down calculations are reviewed periodically and additional write downs are recorded as deemed necessary 
intangible assets and goodwill 
in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets became effective  and as a result  we ceased to amortize goodwill at january  we recorded approximately  of intangible amortization during we recorded approximately  and  of goodwill and intangible amortization during and net intangible assets and goodwill amounted to approximately  as of december  the company does not have any indefinite life intangible assets 
in lieu of amortization  sfas no 
requires that we perform an impairment review of goodwill at least annually 
sfas no 
requires us to test goodwill for impairment at a level referred to as a reporting unit 
goodwill is considered impaired and a loss is recognized when the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value 
we may use a number of valuation methods including quoted marke t prices  discounted cash flows and revenue multiples to determine fair value 
we have completed our goodwill impairment evaluation in connection with the adoption of the new standard and determined that there is no impairment of goodwill as of the date of adoption 
management is not aware of any events  through the date of the company s annual report on form k  which indicates that an impairment has been experienced 
management is also unaware of any circumstance or trend that is reasonably likely to give rise to an impairment in the company s goodwill 
income taxes 
we are required to pay income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
thus  we pay income taxes in the united states  several us states and a number of foreign countries 
each of these jurisdictions has its own laws and regulations  some of which are quite complex and some of which are the subject of disagreement among experts and authorities as to interpretation and application 
the estimation process for preparation of our financial statements involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  reversal of deferred tax liabilities and other sources 
to the extent that we believe recov ery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
when a valuation allowance is recorded or adjusted in a period  we must include an entry within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
we have established a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying amount of recorded deferred tax assets to an amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize additional or less deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the net deferred tax asset would increase or decrease income in the period such determination was made 
if the valuation allowance needs to be increased  income tax expense for that period would increase 
in estimating our tax expense we review internally our operations and the application of applicable laws and rules to our circumstances 
to the extent we believe necessary  we also seek the advice of professional advisers in various jurisdictions 
because the application of tax laws and rules is not always certain  our estimates of tax liability may be more or less than our actual tax liability as ultimately determined by us and reported or as ultimately determined by a tax authority or court reviewing the matter in the future 
as a difference between our estimates and actually reported tax becomes likely  we try to adjust our estimation process appropriately 
we do not do so however  unless it appears likely that such a change is necessary to be consistent with applicable law 
revenue recognition 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon shipment to customers based upon the defined shipping terms 
even though the company receives customer sales orders that may require scheduled product deliveries over several months  sales revenues are only recognized upon physical shipment of the product to the customer 
service revenues are recognized upon completing the service 
service revenues include product repair not under a warranty agreement  city route mapping  product installation  training  consulting to transit authorities and funded research and development projects 
service revenues were not a significant source of revenue for  and  but may increase in and future periods due to higher post warranty repairs  retrofit installation and other service related revenues not offered in previous years 
results of operations the following discussion provides an analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
this should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
the operating results of the years presented were not significantly affected by inflation 
the following table sets forth the percentage of our revenues represented by certain items included in our statements of operations years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses selling  general and administrative research and development total operating expenses operating income other expense  foreign currency transaction gain and interest income loss before income tax benefit expense income tax benefit expense income loss before minority interest in income of consolidated subsidiary minority interest in consolidated subsidiary net income loss comparison of our results for the years ended december  and net sales and gross profit our net sales for the year ended december  increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  our gross profit for the year ended december  increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  following is a discussion of these changes in net sales and gross profit by segment 
transportation communications segment for the year ended december   sales for our transportation communications segment increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this results from an increase in international sales of  and increase in domestic sales of  the increase in international sales is primarily attributed to the inclusion of mobitec sales for a full twelve months in as compared to sales in when mobitec sales were only included from june  through december  the total sales of only the mobitec companies in were  as compared to  for the post acquisition period in the increase in domestic sales is attributed to higher volumes to existing customers as well as sales to new customers of both existing and new products 
product prices on sales of products which comprise a majority of our revenue have decline d in the year ended december  as compared to the prior year due to competition 
sales growth in the transportation communications segment will continue to be dependent upon the expansion of new products and technology  as well as our expansion into new geographic areas 
we believe our relatively high market share positions in most markets precludes significant sales growth from increased market share 
our transportation communications segment gross profit for the year ended december  increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of segment sales  our gross profit was percent of our net segment sales in as compared to percent during international operations contributed  of the increase in gross profit for this was offset by a decrease of  due to lower margins and lower revenues from certain higher margin products in the domestic transportation communications segment 
we believe improvement in our gross profit percentage is dependent upon overall economic and competitive conditions in the transportation sector  introduction of new technology products  and the continued success of our on going cost reduction programs 
law enforcement and surveillance segment for the year ended december   sales for our law enforcement and surveillance segment decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease is attributed to the reallocation of federal and state funds to support post security issues as well as a delay in approval of the us federal budget 
our segment gross profit for the year ended december  decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of segment sales  our gross profit was percent of our net segment sales in as compared to percent during lower sales to the us federal government contributed to these results 
we believe improvement in our gross profit percentage is dependent upon overall economic and competitive conditions in the law enforcement and surveillance sector  introduction of new technology products  and the continued success of our on going cost reduction programs 
selling  general and administrative  research and development expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the majority of this increase was attributed to the acquisition of mobitec  which had a full twelve months of activity in as compared to the prior year period  mobitec was acquired june  as a percentage of our sales  these expenses remained level at percent in and in management believes these expenses will decrease as a percentage of our sales in future periods 
however  our selling  general and administrative expenses may increase in future periods due to expansion into other geographic areas  expansion through acquisition  and introduction of new products and services 
our research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this category of expenses includes internal engineering personnel and outside engineering expense for software and hardware development  sustaining product engineering and new product development 
as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased from percent in to percent in during  certain engineering personnel were used in the development of software that met the capitalization criteria of sfas no 
 capitalization of software development costs  which resulted in recording  of costs as an asset that will be amortized as the sales of the software are realized and over a period no longer than three years 
had this amount not been capitalized  research and development expenses for the year ended december  would have been  as compared to  for the year ended december  in the longer term  w e expect these expenses to remain in the same general range as a percentage of sales  as in the past three years approximately to percent 
operating income the net change in our operating income for the year ended december  was an increase of  or  from operating income of  for the year ended december  to net operating income of  for the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to increased sales from a full year of operating the mobitec companies in the transportation communications segment partially offset by increased personnel and operating expenses for a full year of mobitec 
in addition  we increased our head count in field technicians and support personnel  hourly assembly labor and two people in us corporate administration 
the more significant increases in other expenses were in the us parent of the parent entities segment of the administrative expense categories of audit  tax and accounting fees increase of  american public transportation association trade show expense  as this expense is incurred every three years when the pub lic transportation industry trade show convenes  insurance other increase of  for directors officers insurance premiums  rent building office increase of  and travel and lodging increase of 
other expense and income tax expense our total other expense for the year ended december  was  a net increase in expense of  as compared to  for this increase was primarily due to higher interest expense  for as compared to  in partially offset by a foreign translation exchange gain of  for the increase in interest expense was due to an increase in the weighted average outstanding balance of long term debt which was partially offset by lower interest rates 
our net income tax expense was  for the year ended december   as compared with an income tax benefit of  for the year ended december  in our current tax expense of  arising primarily from foreign jurisdictions  was partially offset by deferred tax benefits of  arising primarily from united states federal and state jurisdictions 
in our income tax benefit was primarily attributed to a reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which were more likely than not to be realized based upon projected taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions 
comparison of our results for the years ended december  and net sales and gross profit our net sales for the year ended december  increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  our gross profit for the year ended december  increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  following is a discussion of these changes in net sales and gross profit by segment 
transportation communications segment for the year ended december   sales for our transportation communications segment increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  of this increase   reflects sales from mobitec and the remaining increase of  represents higher sales levels to existing customers and orders from new customers 
overall  our product prices declined in as a result of competition 
we believe better product technology and competitive pricing  and an underlying growth in the transportation sector  have contributed to improved transportation communications segment sales results 
sales growth in the transportation communications segment will continue to be dependent upon the expansion of new products and technology  as well as our expansion into new geographic areas 
we believe our relatively high market share positions in most markets precludes significant sales growt h from increased market share 
our transportation communications segment gross profit for the year ended december  increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this increase was directly related to the increase in net sales 
as a percentage of segment sales  our gross profit was percent of our net segment sales in both and of the dollar increase in our gross profit during   was attributed to the acquisition of mobitec 
we believe improvement in our gross profit percentage is dependent upon overall economic and competitive conditions in the transportation sector  introduction of new technology products  and the continued success of our on going cost reduction programs 
law enforcement and surveillance segment for the year ended december   sales for our law enforcement and surveillance segment increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase is primarily the result of an increase in sales to both local and federal government agencies 
the law enforcement and surveillance sales declined in following a change in general management at the end of a new general manager and sales manager were hired in june and september  respectively  to assume the leadership roles  the efforts of which materialized in our segment gross profit for the year ended december  increased  or  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  as a percentage of segment sales  our gross profit was percent of our net segment sales for both and this increase was directly related to the increase in net sales to both local and federal government agencies 
we believe improvement in our gross profit percentage is dependent upon overall economic and competitive conditions in the law enforcement and surveillance sector  introduction of new technology products  and the continued success of our on going cost reduction programs 
selling  general and administrative  research and development expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses during were  an increase of  or percent as compared to  for such expenses during we attribute this increase to our acquisition of mobitec and higher payroll and related fringe benefits necessary to support our continued growth 
as a percentage of our sales  these expenses increased from percent in to percent in our research and development expenses for were  an increase of  or percent  as compared to such expenses of  in as a percentage of net sales  these expenses decreased to percent in from percent in the increase in total dollars was primarily related to our acquisition of mobitec 
this category of expenses includes internal engineering personnel and outside engineering expense for software and hardware development  sustaining product engineering and new product development 
operating income the net change in our operating income was an increase of  from income of  in to income of  in this increase was due primarily to the factors set forth above 
other expense and income tax expense our total other expense for was  a net increase in expense of  as compared to  for this increase was primarily the result of higher interest expense due to an increase in long term debt resulting from our acquisition of mobitec and increased short term borrowings 
our income tax benefit for of  was primarily attributed to a reduction in the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets which are more likely than not to be realized based upon future projected taxable income in the appropriate jurisdictions 
in we had no current or deferred income tax expense or benefit 
our liquidity and capital resources the company s net working capital as of december  was  compared to  as of december  our principal sources of liquidity from current assets included cash and cash equivalents of  trade and other receivables of  inventories of  and prepaids and other current assets of  liquidity derived from current liabilities included short term bank and asset based borrowings of  accounts payable of  accrued expenses of  and current maturities of long term debt  deferred tax liabilities and dividends payable of   and  respectively 
the decline in net working capital is substantially attributed to the credit line being reclassified as a current liability due to the expiration date of the agreement being less than one year from the balance sheet date 
the company anticipates either renewing the existing line which expires in august or securing a new facility by the expiration date however  there can be no assurance that this will occur see our financing activities in below 
substantially all of our assets are pledged as security for various elements of long and short term debt described below 
our operating activities used cash of  for the year ended december  primary uses of cash included a net loss of  combined with increases in trade and other receivables  prepaids and a decrease in our related party accounts payable of   and  respectively 
primary sources of cash included a decrease in inventories of  and increases in accounts payable and accrued expenses of  and  respectively 
the increase in trade accounts receivable and payables is a direct result of record sales in the fourth quarter with a significant portion of both sales and purchases occurring late in the quarter 
the balance of cash provided by operating activities of  resulted from non cash expenses for deferred taxes  depreciation  intangible amortization  bad debt and minority interest 
the company s working capital requirements will continue to increase with growth in our sales  primarily due t o the timing between when we must pay our suppliers and the time we receive payment from our customers 
our investing activities used cash of  for the year ended december  the primary use of cash was for expenditures relating to internally developed software  purchases of computer  test and office equipment and the reclassification of a trade account receivable to a note receivable

our financing activities in a the board of directors of the company has approved  subject to shareholder approval at its annual meeting  a proposal authorizing the company to issue an undetermined number of shares of convertible preferred stock and warrants that would convert into an aggregate of up to  shares of common stock in connection with a potential private equity financing

the company anticipates that the aggregate number of shares of common stock into which any new convertible preferred stock and warrants will be convertible may be in excess of percent of the company s common stock and percent of the voting power of the company outstanding before the issuance for 
in addition  the conversion rate of any new convertible preferred stock and the applicable exercise price of any warrants may be set beneath the market price of the company s common stock at the closing of the sale which is less than the greater of book or market value of the stock as of the date of the transaction 
the company  therefore has submitted this proposal for shareholder approval in accordance with nasdaq marketplace rule i d ii

the company s management believes it to be in the company s best interest to reduce the level of the company s indebtedness  and expects to use substantially all of the net proceeds of the proposed financing to repay outstanding debt

restructuring costs the company acquired mobitec in june as part of its plan relative to the acquisition  the company accrued for certain business activities duplicated within the existing and newly acquired international operations 
we believe that it is reasonably likely that beginning in we will save approximately  per year in reduced employee expense  and that beginning in we will save approximately  per year in reduced lease expense 
the accrued restructuring costs totaled  at december  and were comprised of staff reduction costs  lease payments and other selling  general and administrative expenses in the amount of   and  respectively 
upon finalization of the restructuring plan in  the company reduced the accrual by  which was credited to the acquisition cost  and adjusted reserve components to   and  for staff reduction costs  lease payments and other selling  general and administrative expenses  respectively

no amounts were credited against the reserve during all costs to be charged against the accrual  consisting solely of lease payments  are expected to conclude during the first quarter of of the remaining reserve amount of  we can reasonably expect  to be charged to the reserve during and  during new accounting pronouncements in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
this interpretation clarifies existing accounting principles related to the preparation of consolidated financial statements when the equity investors in an entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or when the equity at risk is not sufficient for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin requires a company to evaluate all existing arrangements to identify situations where a company has a variable interest commonly evidenced by a guarantee arrangement or other commitment to provide financial support in a variable interest entity commonly a thinly capitalized entity and further determine when such variable interests require a company to consolidate the variable interest entities financial statement with its own 
th e company is required to perform this assessment by september  and consolidate any variable interest entities for which it will absorb a majority of the entities expected losses or receive a majority of the expected residual gains 
management has not yet performed this assessment  however it is not aware of any material variable interest entity that it may be required to consolidate 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal of activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect upon the company s financial position or operating results 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
this statement is effective for the company beginning january  management does not expect that adoption of this standard will have a material impact upon the company s financial statements 
impact of inflation we believe that inflation has not had a material impact upon our results of operations for each of our fiscal years in the three year period ended december  however  there can be no assurance that future inflation would not have an adverse impact upon our operating results and financial condition 
factors affecting our business and prospects general economic conditions our business partly depends upon general economic and business conditions both domestic and abroad 
in this context  about one third of our sales are outside the usa  primarily in europe particularly the nordic countries  south america  the mid east and australia 
our sales are to businesses involved in transportation communications and law enforcement and surveillance 
we transact our sales with transportation vehicle equipment customers generally in two broad categories 
those categories are end user customers and original equipment manufacturers oem 
general economic conditions that cause customers in such industries  countries and markets to reduce or delay their investments in products and solutions such as those offered by us could have a material adverse effect upon us 
delays or reductions in technology spending could have a material adverse effect upon demand for our products and services  and consequently upon our business  operating results  fi nancial condition  and prospects 
dependence on suppliers our products and solutions are dependent upon the availability of quality components that are procured from third party suppliers 
reliance upon suppliers  as well as industry supply conditions  generally involves several risks  including the possibility of defective parts which can adversely affect the reliability and reputation of the our products  a shortage of components and reduced control over delivery schedules which can adversely affect our manufacturing efficiencies and increases in component costs which can adversely affect our profitability 
we have several single sourced supplier relationships  either because alternative sources are not available or the relationship is advantageous due to performance  quality  support  delivery  capacity or price considerations 
if these sources are unable to provide timely and reliable supply  we could experience manufacturing interruptions  delays or inefficiencies  adversely affecting our results of operations 
even where alternative sources of supply are available  qualification of the alternative suppliers and establishment of reliable supplies could result in delays and a possible loss of sales  which could affect operating results adversely 
we do not believe any material aspect of our supply base involves operating locations in geographic high risk areas 
international activities our international operations are a significant part of our business comprising about one third of our sales 
the success and profitability of international operations are subject to numerous risks and uncertainties  such as economic and labor conditions  political instability  tax laws including us taxes upon foreign subsidiaries and changes in the value of the us dollar versus the local currency in which products are sold 
any unfavorable change in one or more of these factors could have a material adverse effect upon us 
fluctuations in operating results our operating results may fluctuate from period to period and period over period depending upon numerous factors  including customer demand and market acceptance of our products and solutions  new product introductions  varying product mix  delivery due date changes and other factors 
we operate in a market characterized by a relatively long sales cycle 
from first contact to order delivery may be a time period of one year or longer in certain instances 
delivery schedules  as first established with the customer in this long cycle  may change with little or no advance notice as the original delivery schedule draws near 
our business is sensitive to the spending patterns and funding of our customers  which in turn are subject to prevailing economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
governmental legislation a majority of our sales address end customers having some degree of national  federal  regional  state or local governmental entity funding 
these governmental entity funding mechanisms are beyond our control and often are difficult to predict 
further  general budgetary authorizations and allocations for state  local  and federal agencies can change for a variety of reasons  including general economic conditions  and have a material adverse effect upon us 
for example  the legislation tea under which our transportation products business segment domestic sales are derived is subject to reauthorization in while we believe such reauthorization will occur  and that resulting federal funding will be between the present approximately billion annually and billion annually  there can be no advance assurance of such 
this matter is in early stages of legislative action and top management of the company is involved through the industry trade association the america publ ic transportation association the web site of which www 
apta 
com regularly posts status information on such legislative matters 
further  in addition to federal funding to the public transit side of our usa served market there is state and local funding to be considered 
these tend to be affected by general economic conditions 
for example  some transit operating authorities are reducing service in in response to the slow economy  this can have a depressing effect upon sales of our products 
it is not possible to precisely quantify this impact 
however  it is the opinion of management that new product introductions  new served markets entered  and emphasis upon market sectors not so adversely impacted by economic conditions such as exist in  will allow the company to continue growth in and beyond 
however  any unfavorable change in any of these factors and considerations could have a material adverse effect upon us 
technological changes and product transitions our industry is characterized by  and our business strategy is substantially based upon  continuing improvement in technology 
this results in frequent introduction of new products  short product life cycles and continual change in product price performance characteristics 
we must develop new technologies in our products and solutions in order to remain competitive 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to continue to manage and drive technological transitions 
a failure upon our part to effectively manage these transitions of our product lines to new technologies on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect upon us 
in addition  our business depends upon technology trends in our customers businesses 
to the extent that we do not address these technological changes  our business may be adversely impacted 
product development activities the strength of our overall business is partially dependent upon our ability to develop products and solutions based upon new or evolving technology and the market s acceptance of those products 
there can be no assurance that our product development activities will be successful  that new technologies will be available to us  that we will be able to deliver commercial quantities of new products in a timely manner  that those products will adhere to generally accepted industry standards or that products will achieve market acceptance 
further  it is necessary for our products to adhere to generally accepted and frequently changing industry standards  which are subject to change in ways that are beyond our control 
financing our business and operating strategy embraces growth 
that includes internal organic as well as external acquisition oriented growth scenarios 
this requires that we maintain a high degree of emphasis upon finding and securing financing sources of various types both in equity and debt categories 
success in these financing requirements can be adversely impacted by economic conditions and other factors beyond our control 
recently  we have removed the mandatory redemption date  which would have been in december  from the series aaa preferred stock  which the company may now redeem at its sole discretion 
additionally  our board of directors has approved  subject to shareholder approval  a proposal authorizing the company to issue an undetermined number of shares of convertible preferred stock and warrants that would convert into an aggregate of  shares of common stock in connection with a potential private equity financing 
also  our senior lender l ine of credit expires in august we have been pursuing new lines of credit  and or extensions of the present line  for several months 
based upon term sheets received to date and our experience on these matters  we believe new and or extended lines of credit will be secured on a timely basis and on terms no less favorable than at present 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to certain risks arising from transactions in the normal course of our business  and from debt instruments 
such risk is principally associated with interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations  as explained below 
interest rate risk we utilize both long term fixed rate and short term variable rate borrowings to finance the working capital and capital requirements of our business 
we utilize variable rate debt through a revolving credit facility to support working capital needs 
borrowings bear interest at the bank s prime rate plus 
if the bank s prime rate on december  increased by basis points on that date and then remained constant at the higher rate throughout  our interest costs on our outstanding variable rate borrowings at december  of  would increase by approximately  for the year ending december  similarly  if the bank s prime rate on december  decreased by basis points on that date and then remained constant at the lower rate throughout  our interest costs on our outstanding variable rate borrowings at december  of  would decrease by approximately  for the year ending december  the company currently does not use derivative instruments to manage its interest rate risk 
at december   we had outstanding long term fixed rate borrowings including current portions of  we believe the carrying amount of our fixed rate borrowings approximates the estimated fair value for debt with similar terms  interest rates and remaining maturities currently available to companies with similar credit ratings at december  we do not expect changes in the fair value of our long term fixed rate borrowings to have a significant effect upon our operations  cash flow or financial position 
the table below provides information about the company s financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  consisting solely of debt obligations 
the table presents principal cash flows and related weighted average interest rates by expected maturity dates 
the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the company s reporting currency 
the instrument s actual cash flows are denominated in both us dollars us and swedish krona sek  as indicated in parentheses 
expected maturity date liabilities thereafter total long term debt fixed rate us average interest rate fixed rate sek average interest rate foreign currency risk our international subsidiaries operate in europe particularly the nordic countries  south america  the mid east and australia and use local currencies as the functional currency and the us dollar as the reporting currency 
transactions between the company and the international subsidiaries are generally denominated in us dollars 
approximately one third of our revenues are denominated in international currencies 
as a result  we have certain exposures to foreign currency risk 
however  management believes that such exposure does not present a significant risk due to the relative stability of the european and nordic countries and australia 
risk in the mid east and south america is mitigated due to those revenues representing only approximately of our consolidated revenues 
our international operations represent a substantial portion of our overall operating results and asset base 
our identifiable foreign exchange rate exposures result primarily from accounts receivable from customer sales  anticipated purchases of product from third party suppliers and the repayment of intercompany loans with foreign subsidiaries denominated in foreign currencies 
the company primarily manages its foreign currency risk by making use of naturally offsetting positions 
these natural hedges include the using local manufacturing facilities that conduct business in local currency and the use of borrowings denominated in local currencies 
transaction gains and losses on us dollar denominated transactions are recorded within other income and expense in the consolidated statements of operations and the net gain totaled  in primarily due to the decrease in the swedish krona sek from a december  rate of sek per us dollar to a december  rate of sek per us dollar 
in and  the foreign currency exposure was minimal due to lower foreign asset base  fewer transactions and little change in foreign exchange rates between period end balance sheet dates 
the company currently does not use derivative instruments to manage its foreign currency risk 
the table below provides information about our financial instruments and firmly committed sales transactions by functional currency and presents such information in us dollar equivalents

tax and repatriation matters the company and its subsidiaries are subject to income tax laws in each of the countries in which they do business 
the company makes a comprehensive review of the income tax requirements of each of its operations  files appropriate returns and makes appropriate income tax provisions 
these are determined upon an individual subsidiary level and at the corporate level on both an interim and annual basis 
the company provides valuation allowances on deferred tax assets for its subsidiaries that have a history of losses 
management cannot assert that there will likely be sufficient profits generated by certain of these subsidiaries in the near future to offset these losses 
we follow these processes using an appropriate combination of internal staff at both the subsidiary and corporate levels as well as independent outside advisors in review of the various tax laws and in compliance reporting for the various operations 
the undistributed earnings of certain foreign subsidiaries are not subject to additional foreign income taxes nor considered to be subject to us income taxes unless remitted as dividends 
the company intends to reinvest such undistributed earnings indefinitely  accordingly  no provision has been made for us taxes on those earnings 
the company regularly reviews the status of the accumulated earnings of each of its us and foreign subsidiaries as part of its overall financing plans
