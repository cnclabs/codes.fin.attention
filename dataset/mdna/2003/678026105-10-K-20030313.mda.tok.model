item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis together with selected financial data and our financial statements and the notes to those statements included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this discussion contains forward looking statements based on our current expectations  assumptions  estimates and projections about us and our industry 
these forward looking statements involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those indicated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  as more fully described under cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements in this form k 
except to the extent required by law  we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  even if new information becomes available or other events occur in the future 
critical accounting policies in our selection of critical accounting policies  our objective is to properly reflect our financial position and results of operations in each reporting period in a manner that will be understood by those who utilize our financial statements 
often we must use our judgment about uncertainties 
there are several critical accounting policies that we have put into practice that have an important effect on our reported financial results 
we have contingent liabilities and future claims for which we have made estimates of the amount of the eventual cost to liquidate these liabilities or claims 
these liabilities and claims sometimes involve threatened or actual litigation where damages have been quantified and we have made an assessment of our exposure and recorded a provision in our accounts to cover an expected loss 
other claims or liabilities have been estimated based on our experience in these matters and  when appropriate  the advice of outside counsel or other outside experts 
upon the ultimate resolution of these uncertainties  our future reported financial results will be impacted by the difference between our estimates and the actual amounts paid to settle a liability 
examples of areas where we have made important estimates of future liabilities include litigation  taxes  postretirement benefits  warranty claims and contract claims 
the determination of impairment on long lived assets  including goodwill  is conducted as indicators of impairment are present 
if such indicators were present  the determination of the amount of impairment would be based on our judgments as to the future operating cash flows to be generated from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives 
our industry is highly cyclical and our estimates of the period over which future cash flows will be generated  as well as the predictability of these cash flows  can have a significant impact on the carrying value of these assets and  in periods of prolonged down cycles  may result in impairment charges 
we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income or expense in the period in which the facts and circumstances that give rise to the revision become known 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which losses are determined 
our valuation allowances  especially related to potential bad debts in accounts receivable and to obsolescence or market value declines of inventory  involve reviews of underlying details of these assets  known trends in the marketplace and the application of historical factors that provide us with a basis for recording these allowances 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  or if our historical experience is materially different from future experience  additional allowances may be required 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would not likely be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to expense in the period such determination was made 
the selection of the useful lives of many of our assets requires the judgments of our operating personnel as to the length of these useful lives 
should our estimates be too long or short  we might eventually report a disproportionate number of losses or gains upon disposition or retirement of our long lived assets 
we believe our estimates of useful lives are appropriate 
overview we provide a broad range of products and services to the oil and gas industry through our offshore products  well site services and tubular services business segments 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent upon activity levels in the oil and gas industry  particularly our customers willingness to spend capital on the exploration for and development of oil and gas reserves 
demand for our products and services by our customers is highly sensitive to current and expected oil and natural gas prices 
our offshore products segment provides highly engineered and technically designed products for offshore oil and gas development and production systems and facilities 
sales of our offshore products and services depend upon the development of offshore production systems  repairs and upgrades of existing drilling rigs and construction of new drilling rigs 
in this segment  we are particularly influenced by deepwater drilling and production activities 
in our well site services business segment  we provide hydraulic well control services  pressure control equipment and rental tools  drilling rigs and work force accommodations  catering and logistics services 
demand for our well site services depends upon the level of worldwide drilling and workover activity 
through our tubular services segment  we distribute premium casing and tubing 
sales of tubular products and services depend upon the overall level of drilling activity and the types of wells being drilled 
demand for tubular products is positively impacted by increased drilling of deeper horizontal and offshore wells that generally require premium tubulars and connectors  large diameter pipe and longer and additional casing and tubular strings 
energy and oilfield service activities are highly cyclical  depending upon crude oil and natural gas pricing  among other things 
beginning in late and continuing through the early part of  stabilization of oil and gas prices led to increases in drilling activity as well as the refurbishment and new construction of drilling rigs 
in the second half of  crude oil prices declined substantially and reached levels below per barrel in early with this decline in pricing  many of our customers substantially reduced their capital spending and related activities 
this industry downturn continued through most of the price of crude oil and natural gas increased over levels in and due to improved demand for oil  supply reductions by opec member countries and reductions in natural gas storage levels 
crude oil and natural gas prices decreased significantly from levels reached in early by the end of the economic slowdown in the united states and the rest of the world  moderate weather and the resultant increased inventories of oil and gas  especially in the united states  contributed to those price declines 
with those price reductions  our customers responded with decreased drilling activity and spending on exploration and development 
in early  oil and gas prices began to increase and they are currently at relatively high levels 
however  there has not been a corresponding increase in oil service activity given economic and political uncertainties 
we have a diversified product and service offering which has exposure throughout the oil and gas cycle 
demand for our tubular services and well site services is highly correlated to movements in the rig count in the united states 
the table below sets forth a summary of north american rig activity  as measured by baker hughes incorporated  as of and for the periods indicated 
average rig count for the year ended rig count as of december  february  us  canada north america      canadian rig counts typically increase during the peak winter drilling season 
the rig count in the united states and canada  as measured by baker hughes incorporated  fell from  rigs in february to rigs in april the downturn in activity in and had a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services  and the results of our operations decreased significantly 
our business benefited from the improvement in crude oil and natural gas pricing in and early and the resulting increases in the rig count in and the first half of during  the us rig count decreased in the first half of the year and it has been relatively flat since then 
the us rig count reached its lowest level since when it totaled rigs on april  the us rig count has risen since then and totaled as of february  we believe that our offshore products segment lagged the general market recovery in and because its sales primarily relate to offshore construction and production facility development which generally occur later in the exploration and development cycle 
worldwide offshore construction and development activity improved in  and backlog in our offshore products segment increased to million at december   compared to million at december  substantially all of our backlog as of december  is expected to be completed by december  management believes that fundamental oil and gas supply and demand factors will lead to increased drilling activity in north america over time 
however  there can be no assurance that these expectations will be realized 
we view the recent increases in actual oil and natural gas prices and reduction in related supplies as important steps toward increased demand for oilfield service activity 
although we experienced significant declines in north american drilling activity during which impacted our exploration related businesses  we believe that industry fundamentals are improving and will provide us with strong growth opportunities 
the combination prior to our initial public offering in february  scf iii  lp owned majority interests in oil states  hwc and pti  and scf iv  lp owned a majority interest in sooner 
l 
e 
simmons associates  incorporated is the ultimate general partner of scf iii  lp and scf iv  lp lp simmons  the chairman of our board of directors  is the sole shareholder of le simmons associates  incorporated 
immediately prior to the closing of our initial public offering  the combination closed and hwc  pti and sooner merged with wholly owned subsidiaries of oil states 
as a result  hwc  sooner and pti became our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the financial results of oil states  hwc and pti have been combined for the three years in the period ended december  as well as the beginning of calendar until february  using reorganization accounting  which yields results similar to the pooling of interests method 
the combined results of oil states  hwc and pti form the basis for the discussion of our results of operations for those periods 
the operations of oil states  hwc and pti represent two of our business segments  offshore products and well site services 
concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering in february  oil states acquired sooner  and the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
the pro forma financial statements for the years ended december  and reflect the acquisition of sooner effective as of january  and  respectively 
following the acquisition of sooner  we reported under three business segments 
consolidated and pro forma results of operations year ended december  consolidated pro forma revenues well site services offshore products tubular services total gross margin well site services offshore products tubular services corporate other total gross margin as a percent of revenues well site services offshore products tubular services total year ended december  consolidated pro forma operating income loss well site services offshore products tubular services corporate other total year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased million  or  during the year ended december  to million compared to the year ended december  revenues in our well site services segment decreased million  or  in the year ended december  compared to the previous year 
within well site services  comparing the year to the year  our work force accommodations  catering and logistics services and modular building construction services revenues decreased million  or  due to lower activity in canada and the us gulf of mexico  our land drilling revenues decreased million  or  due to lower activity and drilling rates  primarily in west texas  our rental tool services revenues decreased million  or  because lower activity in our us gulf of mexico locations was partially offset by the impact of acquisitions made by the company in march and august and our workover services revenues decreased million  or  as activity  especially in the us gulf of mexico  decreased compared to our offshore products segment revenues increased million  or  in the year compared to the year  due to significantly increased activity supporting offshore production facility construction  primarily in deepwater locations 
our tubular services segment revenues in the year were million  or  lower than in the year because of decreased drilling activity in the united states and significantly lower foreign sales in compared to cost of sales 
cost of sales decreased million  or  to million in the year compared to the previous year 
the cost of sales decrease was primarily due to decreased tubular services sales partially offset by higher costs at our offshore products segment 
tubular services cost of sales decreased million  or  in the year compared to the year and our offshore products segment cost of sales increased million  or  in the year compared to the year gross margins 
our gross margins  which we calculate before a deduction for depreciation and amortization expense  decreased million  or  to million in the year compared to the year our gross margin as a percent of revenue improved from in the year to in due to a more favorable mix of our revenues consisting of higher margin offshore products and well site services activities with less of our revenues consisting of tubular sales 
our offshore products gross margins increased million  or  in the year compared to the year and our gross margin percentage increased to in the year compared to in the year as higher volumes of product shipments lead to increased operating efficiencies in the year our well site services gross margins decreased million  or  to million in the year compared to the year the gross margin percentage for well site services declined to in the year compared to in within our well site services segment  our land drilling business gross margins decreased million  or  to million in compared to total gross margin of million in because of decreased drilling activity and lower prices obtained for drilling services  our rental tool business reported gross margins totaling million  or of revenue  compared to gross margins totaling million  or of revenue in as we saw increased price competition for rental tools which offset the positive effect of our rental tool business acquisitions  our workover services gross margins in the year totaled million  or of revenues  compared to gross margins of million  or of revenues  as decreased us gulf of mexico margins and activity more than offset the positive effect of higher international activity  and our work force accommodations  catering and logistics services and modular building construc tion services businesses gross margin decreased in to million  or of revenue  compared to million  or of revenue  in the previous year because of the impact of lower drilling activity in in canada and the us gulf of mexico and because a greater percentage of revenues resulted from relatively low margin construction activity 
our tubular services margins in the year totaled million  a decrease of million  or  compared to the year while tubular services gross margins were approximately the same in each of the last two years  the volume of tubular products shipped in decreased by approximately compared to selling  general and administrative expense 
during the year  selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased million  or  to million from million in the year as a percent of revenues  sg a increased to in compared to in increased costs in the year compared to at our offshore products segment  driven by higher activity and increased employee incentive costs were only partially offset by lower well site services segment costs associated with decreased activity within that segment 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense totaled million in the year compared to million in the million decrease is principally related to the elimination of goodwill amortization in in comparison  we amortized million of goodwill in the year partially offset by additional depreciation and amortization associated with capital additions and intangibles recorded as part of business acquisitions in the years and operating income 
our operating income represents revenues less i product costs  ii service and other costs  iii sg a  and iv depreciation and amortization plus other operating income 
our operating income decreased million  or  to million for from million in operating income from our well site services segment decreased million from million for to million for operating income for our offshore products segment increased million to million for compared to million in operating income in our tubular services segment decreased million from million in to million in corporate other operating loss improved from a loss of million in to a loss of million in primarily because of the discontinuance of goodwill amortization in net interest expense 
net interest expense totaled million in the year  a decrease of million  or  compared to net interest expense of million in both interest rates and average debt balances were lower during when compared to income tax expense 
our income tax expense totaled million  or of pretax income  in the year compared to million  or of pretax income in the year the increased tax expense is primarily due to the higher effective tax rate which increased in compared to as a result of a lower amount of net operating loss carryforwards available to offset taxable income 
we expect our effective tax rate to increase to approximately for the full year pro forma year ended december  compared to pro forma year ended december  revenues 
pro forma revenues increased by from million during the year ended december  to million during revenues from our well site services segment increased million  or  to million of which million was generated from our work force accommodations  catering and logistics services and modular building construction services  million was generated from our rental tool business  million was generated from our land drilling operations and million was generated from our hydraulic workover operations 
increases in canadian drilling activity  oil sands development activity and strong gulf of mexico accommodations activity drove the increase in revenues in our work force accommodations  catering and logistics and modular building construction services 
the increase in revenues from our rental tool operations was due to increased equipment available to rent and two small acquisitions completed in the third quarter of increases in revenues from our land drilling services were due to improvements in utilization and pricing from the year to the year increased foreign activity and higher pricing contributed to our hydraulic workover improvement in compared to our tubular services revenues increased million  or  as a direct result of increased drilling activity over the period 
in addition  tubular services revenues in the fourth quarter of benefited from a large one time sale of inventory held in international locations pursuant to two scheduled contract terminations 
such international sales totaled million and million in and  respectively 
one of these contracts expired on march  and the other expired on june  the remaining million increase in revenues was generated by our offshore products segment 
this year over year increase in revenues was generated by increased demand for our bearings and connector products and certain fabrication work 
cost of sales 
pro forma cost of sales increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the cost of sales increase was due to increased activity at each of our operating segments and other factors influencing revenues 
cost of sales increased in our well site services  tubular services and offshore products segments by million  million and million  respectively 
gross margin 
our pro forma gross margins  which we calculate before a deduction for depreciation and amortization expense  increased million from million in to million in our gross margin percentage was consistent in and at due to an improvement in our offshore products and well site services segments  offset by declines in our tubular services gross margin percentages 
offshore products gross margin increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
our gross margin percentage in this segment increased from in to in this gross margin increase was due to improved revenues and margins related to our bop stack integration and repair services as well as increased demand for our flexible bearings and connector products 
we also had improved margins related to the manufacturing of rig and vessel equipment 
our well site services gross margins increased from million in to million in  an increase of million  or 
our gross margin percentage in this segment increased from in to in within our well site services segment  land drilling contributed million of the margin increase as both utilization of our rigs and average revenues per day worked increased in compared to our work force accommodations  catering and logistics services and modular building construction services was responsible for an improvement in gross margin of million due to increased activity  especially in the us gulf of mexico operations  increased equipment available to rent as a result of capital expenditures and increased activity in the oil sands development areas in northern alberta  canada 
our rental tool operations contributed margin improvement of million 
this increase in gross margin was principally related to the increase in revenues discussed above 
our hydraulic workover operations gross margins increased million in compared to as a result of increased activity  especially in foreign locations 
tubular services gross margins decreased from million  or of revenues  during to million  or of revenues during  a decrease of million  or 
our tubular services segment suffered margin declines during the last half of due to general market declines and our decision to aggressively reduce inventory levels in anticipation of a weakening market 
this margin decline occurred despite a liquidation of our international tubular inventories during the fourth quarter of gross margin from international sales totaled million and million in and  respectively 
the negative gross margin for corporate other is due to recognition of unallocated insurance expense at the corporate level 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
during the year ended december   pro forma selling  general and administrative sg a expenses increased million  or  to million from million during as a percent of revenues  sg a expenses declined to in from in sg a expenses increased by million  or  in our well site services segment due to headcount increases in support of increased market activity and higher incentive pay  which is based upon our ebitda performance 
corporate headquarters charges were up million due to the establishment of a new corporate headquarters office 
depreciation and amortization 
pro forma depreciation and amortization increased million to a total of million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to acquisitions and capital expenditures made in our well site services segment during and operating income 
our pro forma operating income represents revenues less i product costs  ii service and other costs  iii sg a and iv depreciation and amortization  plus other operating income 
our operating income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million during operating income from our well site services segment increased million from million for the year ended december  to million during operating income for our tubular services segment decreased million to million for the year ended december  from million during operating income in our offshore products segment increased million to million for the year ended december  from an operating loss of million during net interest expense 
net pro forma interest expense totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million during the million reduction in net interest expense was primarily related to lower interest rates  partially offset by an increase in average debt balances outstanding 
average debt balances were higher in as a result of refinancing of certain preferred stock issues in february income tax expense 
pro forma income tax expense totaled million during compared to million during the decrease of million  and the corresponding low effective tax rate  was primarily due to a reduction in the valuation allowance applied against tax assets  primarily net operating losses nol s  due to expected tax benefits resulting from the combination 
we adjusted such valuation allowance because we determined that it was more likely than not that the deferred tax assets would be realized 
minority interest 
minority interest was immaterial during the years ended december  and substantially all of the minority interests were acquired  and therefore reduced  in connection with the combination 
consolidated and combined results of operations prior to the sooner acquisition in february  we reported under two business segments  offshore products and well site services 
information for these two segments  which represent the combined results of oil states  hwc and pti using reorganization accounting  is presented in our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
subsequent to the february acquisition of sooner and the combination  we reported under the three business segments discussed above 
we believe that the pro forma results of operations discussed above reflect the components of our current business operations and capital structure 
for a discussion of our consolidated and combined results of operations  please refer to our annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended december  filed with the securities and exchange commission on march  liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to fund capital expenditures  such as expanding and upgrading our manufacturing facilities and equipment  increasing our rental tool and workover assets  increasing our work force accommodation units  funding new product development and general working capital needs 
in addition  capital is needed to fund strategic business acquisitions 
our primary sources of funds have been cash flow from operations  proceeds from borrowings under our bank facilities and private and public capital investments 
cash was provided by operations during the years ended december  and in the amounts of million and million  respectively 
cash provided by operations in was generated by net income plus non cash charges partially offset by working capital increases for purchases of inventory at our offshore products and tubular services segments 
during the last half of  our tubular inventories increased million  or  as we purchased inventory in anticipation of increased future demand for tubular products from exploration and production companies and other tubular distributors 
offshore products inventories increased in compared to because of increased activity in that segment 
cash used by investing activities in totaled million compared to million in capital expenditures in were million and related principally to our well site services segment mil lion and offshore products segment million 
we spent cash totaling million on six acquisitions 
see note to our consolidated and combined financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we currently expect to spend a total of approximately million during to upgrade our equipment and facilities and expand our product and service offerings 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures with internally generated funds 
capital expenditures totaling million during the year ended december  consisted principally of purchases of assets for our well site services businesses 
net cash of million was provided by financing activities during the year ended december   primarily as a result of borrowings under our bank credit facility to fund our capital expenditures and acquisitions 
net cash of million was used in financing activities during the year ended december   primarily as a result of debt and preferred stock repayments  partially offset by net proceeds from our initial public offering 
the following summarizes our debt and lease obligations at december  in thousands due in less due in due after december  total than year years years debt and lease obligations long term debt  including capital leases    non cancelable operating leases     total contractual cash obligations     our debt obligations at december  are included in our consolidated balance sheet  which is a part of our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
we have not entered into any material leases or off balance sheet arrangements subsequent to december  with the proceeds received in our initial public offering completed in february  we repaid million of outstanding subordinated debt  redeemed million of preferred stock of oil states  paid accrued interest on subordinated debt and accrued dividends on preferred stock aggregating million  and repurchased common stock from non accredited shareholders and shareholders holding pre emptive stock purchase rights for million 
the balance of the proceeds were used to reduce amounts outstanding under bank lines of credit 
concurrently with the closing of our initial public offering  we issued  shares of common stock in the scf exchange 
concurrently with our initial public offering  we also entered into a million senior secured revolving credit facility which was increased to million of availability in december up to million of commitments under the credit facility are available in the form of loans denominated in canadian dollars and may be made to our principal canadian operating subsidiaries 
this credit facility replaced existing credit facilities 
the facility was extended during the fourth quarter of and matures on january   unless extended for an additional one year period with the consent of the lenders 
amounts borrowed under this facility bear interest  at our election  at either a variable rate equal to libor or  in the case of canadian dollar denominated loans  the bankers acceptance discount rate plus a margin ranging from to  or an alternate base rate equal to the higher of the bank s prime rate and the federal funds effective rate plus or  in the case of canadian dollar denominated loans  the canadian prime rate plus a margin ranging from to  depending upon the ratio of total debt to ebitda as defined in the credit facility and which differs from the definition of ebitda as defined generally used by us  as set forth in note of item selected financial data above 
we pay commitment fees of per year on the undrawn portion of the facility 
commitments under our credit facility will be permanently reduced  and loans prepaid  by an amount equal to of the net cash proceeds of all non ordinary course asset sales and the issuance of additional debt and by of the issuance of equity securities 
mandatory commitment reductions will be allocated pro rata based on amounts outstanding under the us dollar denominated facility and the canadian dollar denominated facility 
in addition  voluntary reductions in commitments are permitted 
our credit facility is guaranteed by all of our active domestic subsidiaries and  in some cases  our canadian and other foreign subsidiaries 
our credit facility is secured by a first priority lien on all our inventory  accounts receivable and other material tangible and intangible assets  as well as those of our active subsidiaries 
however  no more than of the voting stock of any foreign subsidiary is required to be pledged if the pledge of any greater percentage would result in adverse tax consequences 
our ability to borrow under the facility is subject to certain customary conditions  including the continuing accuracy of representations and warranties  the lack of material adverse changes  our continuing compliance with laws and the lack of defaults under the facility 
our credit facility contains negative covenants that restrict our ability to borrow additional funds  encumber assets  pay dividends  sell assets except in the normal course of business and enter into other significant transactions 
in addition  our credit facility requires us to maintain a ratio of ebitda to interest expense of not less than to  a level of consolidated net tangible assets of not less than million  less the amount of goodwill not to exceed million associated with acquisitions made by us in the period from june  to january   plus of each quarter s consolidated net income but not loss  a maximum ratio of total debt to ebitda of not greater than to  and a maximum ratio of total senior debt to ebitda of not greater than to under our credit facility  the occurrence of specified change of control events involving our company would constitute an event of default that would permit the banks to  among other things  accelerate the maturity of the facility and cause it to become immediately due and payable in full 
as of december   we had million outstanding under this facility and an additional million of outstanding letters of credit  leaving million available to be drawn under the facility 
we had an aggregate of approximately million of subordinated debt outstanding at december  the subordinated debt will become due and payable at various times through september see note to our consolidated and combined financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our total debt represented of our total book capitalization at december  we believe that cash from operations and available borrowings under our credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity needs for the foreseeable future 
if our plans or assumptions change or are inaccurate  or we make any acquisitions  we may need to raise additional capital 
however  there is no assurance that we will be able to raise additional funds or be able to raise such funds on favorable terms 
tax matters for the year ended december   we had deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  of approximately million for federal income tax purposes before application of valuation allowances 
our primary deferred tax assets are net operating loss carry forwards  or nols  which total approximately million 
a valuation allowance is currently provided against the majority of our nols 
the nols expire over a period through a portion of our nols are currently limited under section of the internal revenue code due to a change of control that occurred during in  approximately million of nols are available for use if sufficient income is generated 
however  if a successive change in control is triggered in pursuant to section  it is possible that a significantly lesser amount of nols would be available for use in such year 
such a scenario could have a significant negative impact on our cash taxes payable  however  it is anticipated that any such change would not trigger a significant adverse impact on our tax expense 
this is attributable to the operation of the valuation allowance related to our nol carryforwards 
see note to our consolidated and combined financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
our effective tax rate was approximately 
this low effective tax rate was due to the partial utilization of net operating losses which benefited the consolidated group after the combination 
during  we paid cash taxes of million 
we currently estimate our effective tax rate will be approximately 
our actual effective tax rates could differ materially from these estimates  which are subject to a number of uncertainties  including future taxable income projections  the amount of income attributable to domestic versus foreign sources  the amount of capital expenditures and any changes in applicable tax laws and regulations 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets the statements  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
we began applying the new rules on accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets in the first quarter of application of the nonamortization provisions of the statements resulted in an increase in net income of approximately million 
per diluted share for year we have performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of december  and there was no impairment of assets indicated 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   and we expect to adopt the statement effective january  we expect that this statement will have an immaterial effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
we were required to adopt this statement effective january   and it did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in april  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
which  among other things  rescinded sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
we are required to adopt this statement in  and we expect it will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
we have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  issued in december  effective with our december  consolidated and combined financial statements and related footnotes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we have long term debt and revolving lines of credit subject to the risk of loss associated with movements in interest rates 
as of december   we had floating rate obligations totaling approximately million for amounts borrowed under our revolving credit facility 
these floating rate obligations expose us to the risk of increased interest expense in the event of increases in short term interest rates 
if the floating interest rate were to increase by from december  levels  our consolidated interest expense would increase by a total of approximately million annually 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
our operations are conducted in various countries around the world in a number of different currencies 
as such  our earnings are subject to movements in foreign currency exchange rates when transactions are denominated in currencies other than the us dollar  which is our functional currency 
in order to mitigate the effects of exchange rate risks  we generally pay a portion of our expenses in local currencies and a substantial portion of our contracts provide for collections from customers in us dollars 
as of december   we had canadian dollar denominated debt totaling approximately million 
as of december   we had foreign currency forward purchase option contracts totaling million at rates not significantly different from the actual rates at december  we have incurred no material gains or losses from foreign currency hedging activities
