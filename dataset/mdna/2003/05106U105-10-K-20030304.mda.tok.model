item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto and with the cautionary statements section included elsewhere in this form k 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we must make decisions which impact the reported amounts and the related disclosures 
such decisions include the selection of the appropriate accounting principles to be applied and the assumptions on which to base accounting estimates 
in reaching such decisions  we apply judgment based on our understanding and analysis of the relevant circumstances 
note to the consolidated financial statements provides a summary of the significant accounting policies followed in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies  significant judgments and estimates revenue recognition 
we derive revenues from the sale of systems  spare parts and services 
system sales we require customers  excluding our distributors  that have new inspection applications to complete pre shipment authorization testing of purchased systems at our facility  prior to shipment 
during this testing  the customer verifies that the system meets their specifications and authorizes shipment 
for systems that require such testing  revenue is recognized as follows revenue from systems meeting pre shipment authorization testing is recognized when the product has shipped  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we do not deem installation to be essential to the functionality of our systems as it does not involve altering the system s features or capabilities or the building of complex interfaces 
revenue from systems that have not been demonstrated to meet customer specifications prior to shipment is recognized when title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer  installation has occurred and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
when the customer has already accepted a previous system  with the same specifications  for the same application  we do not require pre shipment authorization testing 
revenue is recognized when the product has shipped  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
system sales are accounted for as multiple element arrangements 
in transactions that include multiple products and or services  we allocate the revenue to each element based on their relative fair value or in the absence of fair value  the residual method and recognize the associated revenue when all revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element 
spare parts revenue spare parts revenue is recognized when the parts have been shipped  title and risk of loss have transferred to the customer and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
service revenue service revenue is recognized after the services are performed and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
revenue  from maintenance contracts  is recognized ratably over the period of the contract 
service revenues were insignificant during the years ended december   and valuation of accounts receivable 
we review accounts receivable to determine which are doubtful of collection 
in making the determination of the appropriate allowance for doubtful accounts  we consider our history of write offs  relationships with our customers and the overall credit worthiness of our customers 
for the three years ended december   we have had accounts receivable write offs totaling  changes in the credit worthiness of customers  general economic conditions and other factors may impact the level of future write offs 
valuation of inventory 
we review inventory for obsolescence and excess quantities to determine that items deemed obsolete or excess are appropriately reserved 
in making the determination  we consider future sales of related products and the quantity of inventory at the balance sheet date assessed against each part s past usage rates and future expected usage rates 
for the three years ended december   we have written off inventory totaling  we have an allowance for obsolete and excess inventory of  at december   which represents our estimate of obsolete and excess inventory 
changes in factors such as technology  customer demand  competitor product introductions and other matters could affect the level of obsolete and excess inventory in the future 
accounting for income taxes 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our actual current tax exposure together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of tax items for tax and accounting 
these temporary differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we evaluate the weight of all available evidence to determine whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred income tax assets will not be realized 
during the second quarter of we recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties surrounding our ability to utilize some or all of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses  as well as other temporary differences between book and tax accounting 
if the realization of deferred tax assets in the future is considered more likely than not  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase net income in the period such determination is made 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially affect our financial position and results of operations 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have not created  and are not party to  any special purpose or off balance sheet entities for the purpose of raising capital  incurring debt or operating parts of our business that are not consolidated into our financial statements 
we do not have any arrangements or relationships with entities that are not consolidated into our financial statements that are reasonably likely to materially affect our liquidity or the availability of our capital resources 
results of operations the following table presents the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of net revenues 
years ended december  net revenues cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses non recurring expenses operating income loss interest income  net other expense income loss before provision for benefit from income taxes provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss our business is subject to the cyclical nature of the microelectronic device manufacturing markets we serve 
these cycles are caused by significant fluctuations in the supply and demand of microelectronic devices driven by such factors as changes in technology and global economic conditions 
during and there has been a dramatic slowdown in demand for microelectronic devices resulting in excess capacity and decreased demand for microelectronic manufacturing equipment 
the decreased demand has caused our quarterly orders and sales to fluctuate dramatically 
we are not able to predict when the microelectronic industries will recover 
future quarterly and annual results will continue to be impacted by these cycles  the timing of new product announcements and releases by us or our competitors  market acceptance of new or enhanced versions of our products  changes in the pricing of our products and the timing and level of our research and development expenditures 
during the second quarter of  in response to the current downturn  we implemented and are still using components of a cost management program 
the program has included  at various times  raw material cost reductions  reductions in temporary and contract staff  work force reductions  mandatory time off and decreases in discretionary spending  reductions in executive compensation and overtime the cost cutting programs 
although we continued to maintain various components of the cost cutting programs during  these savings were offset by our decision to invest in developing our worldwide sales and service organization and in the continued development of new and existing products to better serve our customers and maintain our technology leadership 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease in net revenues was the result of lower nsx revenues  partially offset by revenues from our di series  which was introduced in the fourth quarter of the decrease in nsx revenues was due to the continued downturn in the microelectronic industries 
net revenues derived from international sales represented and of net revenues in and  respectively 
international net revenues were primarily the result of sales to asia  which comprised and of net revenues in and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues  in the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to a decrease in the number of systems manufactured  which resulted in lower manufacturing utilization and increased labor and overhead costs per system manufactured  and was also impacted by sales of models within the di series that had lower margins than our other products 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million in and  however  these expenses increased as a percentage of net revenues to from due to the decrease in net revenues 
the expense dollars in increased due to i costs associated with systems being evaluated by customers  ii higher travel expenses due to increased international travel in our sales and service organization  and iii depreciation expense related to assets capitalized subsequent to the beginning of the increase was offset by lower compensation expense and the various components of the cost cutting programs 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues  in the increase was primarily due to i our focus on advancing the development of new and existing products in each of our product lines  which led to the hiring of additional engineers and the use of additional outside contractors  ii depreciation and amortization expense related to assets and software capitalized subsequent to the beginning of  and iii travel costs related to visiting customer locations 
these increases were partially offset by various components of the cost cutting programs 
non recurring expenses 
non recurring expenses in of million include  for the write off of acquisition related costs   related to the modification of our distributor agreement with metron technology bv  to focus metron s activities entirely on south korea and  of employee severance costs related to reductions in work force 
non recurring expenses in of  consist of  related to the modification of our distributor agreement with metron  as a result of our decision to sell directly to customers in taiwan and  of employee severance costs 
interest income  net 
net interest income decreased  to  in from million in the decrease is due to lower overall investment balances in  due to the use of cash to fund operations and acquire property and equipment  and lower rates of return earned on investment balances 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in was  or an effective tax rate of  compared to a benefit of  or an effective tax rate of  in the provision for income taxes in is due to the recording of a full valuation allowance against deferred tax assets  in the second quarter of sfas no 
accounting for income taxes  requires the establishment of a valuation allowance to reflect the likelihood of the realization of deferred tax assets 
as a result of our taxable earnings history and uncertainty as to the extent and timing of profitability in future periods  we have recorded a full valuation allowance of million against deferred tax assets at december  the high effective income tax rate in  compared to the federal statutory rate of plus state and local taxes  was primarily due to the impact of federal and state general business and extraterritorial income credits and tax exempt interest income that could not be utilized until future years due to our net loss 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  net revenues 
net revenues decreased million  or  to million in  from million in the decrease in net revenues was the result of fewer shipments of our nsx systems due to a worldwide decline in capital spending by microelectronic device manufacturers throughout this decline was the result of a significant slowdown in demand for the devices these manufacturers produce  which resulted in manufacturers having increased inventory  overcapacity and  consequently  lower capital spending 
net revenues derived from the sale of nsx systems represented and of net revenues in and  respectively 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues  in the decrease in gross margin percentage was primarily due to the decrease in the number of systems manufactured  which resulted in lower manufacturing utilization and increased labor and overhead costs per system sold 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues  in the increased expense dollars were due to salaries and benefits related to sales  customer service and administrative employees hired during the second half of and costs associated with opening our direct sales and service office in taiwan in these increases were partially offset by lower discretionary and compensation expenses during the second half of due to the cost cutting programs that were implemented in response to the decrease in orders and shipments during this period 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased million  or  to million  or of net revenues  in  from million  or of net revenues  in the increase was due to salaries and benefits related to additional engineers hired during to advance the development of our new di and yieldpilot systems  partially offset by a decrease in hiring and compensation related expenses during the second half of due to the cost cutting programs that were implemented during this period 
non recurring expenses 
non recurring expenses in of  include  of employee severance costs related to reductions in work force implemented in the second and fourth quarters in response to the decrease in orders and shipments during this period  and  of expenses related to the termination of our distributor agreement in taiwan  as a result of our decision to sell direct to customers in taiwan 
non recurring expense in consists entirely of the write off of certain internal business automation software as a result of our decision to discontinue the implementation of this software 
interest income  net 
net interest income increased  to million in from million in the increase is due to interest income earned from investing the proceeds received from our initial public offering the ipo in june for all of  partially offset by lower overall investment balances in  due to the use of cash to fund operations and lower rates of return earned on investment balances 
income taxes 
the benefit from income taxes in was  or an effective tax rate of  compared to a provision for income taxes of  or an effective tax rate of  in the high effective income tax rate in  compared to the federal statutory rate of plus state and local taxes  was primarily due to the impact of federal and state general business and extraterritorial income credits and tax exempt interest income that will not be utilized until future years due to our net loss 
the low effective income tax rate in was primarily due to federal and state general business credits 
liquidity and capital resources as of december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  as compared to million at december  the increase in cash and cash equivalents was primarily due to the reinvestment of a portion of the maturities of short term investments in cash equivalents 
as of december  we had working capital of million as compared to million at december  working capital decreased primarily due to the use of short term investments to fund operations 
during  net cash used in operating activities was million  which resulted primarily from our net loss and an increase in accounts receivable  partially offset by non cash charges  decreased prepaid expenses and other current assets and inventories 
net cash provided by investing activities was million  due to million of net proceeds from the redemption and purchases of securities  partially offset by million of additions to property and equipment and other assets 
net cash provided by financing activities was million from the proceeds of issuances of common stock in conjunction with the exercise of stock options by employees and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
during  net cash used in operating activities was million  which resulted primarily from increased inventories  prepaid and other current assets and decreased accounts payable  partially offset by decreased accounts receivable and an increase in customer deposits 
net cash used in investing activities was  due to million of additions to property and equipment and other assets  partially offset by million of net proceeds from the redemption and purchases of securities held to maturity 
net cash provided by financing activities was  from the proceeds of issuances of common stock in conjunction with the exercise of stock options by employees and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
during  net cash used in operating activities was million  which resulted primarily from increased accounts receivable  inventories and prepaid and other current assets  partially offset by increased accounts payable  accrued compensation  other accrued liabilities and accrued income taxes 
net cash used in investing activities was million  due to purchases of held to maturity securities of million and million of additions to property and equipment  partially offset by million of proceeds from the maturities of securities held to maturity 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  including million of net proceeds received from the sale of  shares of common stock in the ipo  partially offset by the re payment of million of debt 
at december   our principal sources of liquidity consisted of million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable debt instruments and our revolving credit line  which expires in april this agreement allows for borrowings of up to million subject to availability based on accounts receivable and inventory balances 
our liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of our business and others of which relate to the uncertainties of global economies and the cyclical nature of the microelectronic industries 
we have no outstanding debt at december  although liquidity requirements will fluctuate based on the timing and extent of these factors  management believes that cash generated from operations  together with existing cash and investment balances and our line of credit will be adequate to satisfy our liquidity requirements for the next months 
the following table summarizes our future cash payments due under contractual obligations as of december  noncancelable operating lease obligations in thousands total  acquisitions on february  we entered into a settlement and purchase agreement with semiconductor technologies instruments  inc sti and its sole shareholder  asti holdings  ltd asti of singapore  to purchase all of the outstanding stock of sti and resolve any remaining disputes with asti and sti regarding our may stock purchase agreement with sti and asti which we terminated in august pursuant to the settlement and purchase agreement  we have agreed to purchase all of the outstanding stock of sti for a purchase price of million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
the agreement is subject to approval of the shareholders of asti and we expect to close the purchase in the second quarter of the closing of the proposed acquisition of sti remains subject to various risks  including the possibility that shareholders of asti will not approve the transaction or that other legal or regulatory issues may arise that prevent the closing 
even if the closing takes place  our ability to benefit from the acquisition will depend upon how quickly and effectively we integrate sti s operations and personnel with our business 
unanticipated difficulties or costs in this integration process may adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to close the acquisition  asti and sti may continue to seek resolution of disputes with respect to our may purchase agreement 
in august  we terminated the may purchase agreement and asserted that asti owed us a break up fee of million 
asti claimed that we had improperly terminated the agreement and asserted that we owed the million break up fee to them 
if we are unable to resolve this dispute by closing the proposed acquisition  resulting damage awards or the payment of the break up fee may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
whether or not we prevail  the legal expenses involved in any such proceeding may be material 
impact of accounting standards in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statements of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and must be applied beginning january  sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred rather than when the exit or disposal plan is approved 
we do not expect that the adoption of sfas will have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december   as required by the standard 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires companies to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
guarantees in existence at december  are grandfathered for the purposes of recognition and would only need to be disclosed 
we do not expect that the adoption of fin will have an effect on our consolidated financial statements 
we will adopt the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin for guarantees issued or modified after december  in december  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this issue addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
in some arrangements  the different revenue generating activities deliverables are sufficiently separable and there exists sufficient evidence of their fair values to separately account for some or all of the deliverables that is  there are separate units of accounting 
in other arrangements  some or all of the deliverables are not independently functional  or there is not sufficient evidence of their fair values to account for them separately 
this issue addresses when and  if so  how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
this issue does not change otherwise applicable revenue recognition criteria 
the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the adoption of eitf will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment to fasb statement 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas  accounting for stock based compensation  to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we adopted the disclosure provisions of sfas effective december  in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are effective for newly created variable interest entities formed after january   and for existing variable interest entities  on the first interim or annual reporting period beginning after june  we will adopt the provisions of fin for existing variable interest entities on july  the disclosure requirements of this interpretation are effective for financial statements issued after january  we adopted the provisions of fin for newly formed variable interest entities effective january   which will not have a material effect on our financial statements 
in addition  we adopted the disclosure provisions of fin effective december  cautionary statements certain statements contained in this form k and other written and oral statements made from time to time by us do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
as such  they are considered forward looking statements which provide current expectations or forecasts of future events 
such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as anticipate  believe  estimate  expect  intend  may  could  possible  plan  project  should  will  forecast and similar words or expressions 
our forward looking statements generally relate to our growth strategies  financial results  product development and sales efforts 
one must carefully consider forward looking statements and understand that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties  known and unknown  and may be affected by inaccurate assumptions  including  among others  those discussed below 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed and actual results may vary materially 
we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  but investors are advised to consult any further disclosures by us on this subject in our filings with the securities and exchange commission  especially on forms k  q and k if any  in which we discuss in more detail various important factors that could cause actual results to differ from expected or historic results 
we note these factors as permitted by the private securities litigation reform act of it is not possible to foresee or identify all such factors 
as such  investors should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks  uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions 
global economic and political environments are important to economic conditions  and long term continued risk or concerns could affect our business 
future political or related events similar or comparable to the september  terrorist attacks  or significant military conflicts such as the possible war in iraq  or long term reactions of governments and society to such events  may significantly affect the willingness or ability of our customers to visit our facilities or trade shows  review our systems capabilities and or purchase or take delivery of our products  as well as our abilities to visit our customers  to perform application studies for our customers  to sell and deliver solutions  and to service those solutions 
any decline in willingness or ability of our customers to travel and visit our facilities  or our ability to travel and visit our customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business and the financial condition and results of operations 
in addition to political risks  the global economy has remained in a downturn over the past year and any further global or regional weakening or the extension of the current recession beyond current reasonable market expectations could have a material adverse effect on our business and our financial condition and results of operations 
the microelectronic industries that we serve are highly cyclical and are currently experiencing a severe and prolonged downturn 
our primary markets are the microelectronic industries  including semiconductor  which also includes advanced packaging  optoelectronics  photonics  mems  micro displays and data storage 
our business depends heavily upon capital expenditures by manufacturers in these industries 
the microelectronic industries are highly cyclical  with periods of capacity shortage and periods of excess capacity  this is historically due to sudden changes in demand for microelectronic devices 
in periods of excess capacity  there are often drastic changes in the timing and quantity of capital equipment purchases and investments in new technology or capacity needs by our customers  including sharp cuts in purchases of capital equipment by customers  including our products 
the timing  length and volatility of these periods are difficult to predict  resulting in pressure on our revenues  gross margin and net income 
in addition to affecting our customers  downturns also challenge our suppliers  vendors  other partners  as well as our management  sales  engineering  manufacturing  customer service and other employees who are vital to our success 
the microelectronic equipment industry  as well as many of the microelectronic device industries  is currently experiencing a severe and prolonged downturn 
many industry sources have indicated that the current microelectronic industry downturn may be the steepest and one of the longest declines in history 
our management cannot predict when a recovery will begin or how robust it will be 
there are similarly no accurate or reliable market predictions from industry sources predicting the timing  length and strength of a recovery 
in the past  during microelectronic industry downturns  customers typically reduce or delay purchases  and or delay delivery or cancel orders 
as a result  it is imperative that we maintain an organization able to quickly and effectively align with market conditions including bringing our cost structures in line with current industry and overall market conditions 
at the same time  it is imperative that we continue to serve our existing customers  provide new and improved solutions for new and existing customers  operate effectively with our suppliers  and motivate and retain key employees 
if we are  for any reason  unable to achieve any one or more of the above objectives in an efficient  effective and timely manner  there could be a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
furthermore  any delays or reductions in future purchases of capital equipment or delays or cancellations of current orders by microelectronic device manufacturers  for any reason  may have a material adverse effect on our business and the financial condition and results of operations 
our future rate of growth is highly dependent on the development and growth of the market for microelectronic device test and inspection equipment and the market acceptance of our products 
we primarily target our products to address the needs of microelectronic device manufacturers for wafer defect inspection 
if for any reason the market for microelectronic device test and inspection equipment fails to stabilize in the near term  and grow in the long term as we expect  we may be unable to maintain current revenue levels in the short term and return to our historical growth in the long term 
in addition  our current revenue levels and future growth depends upon the adoption of our products by microelectronic device manufacturers 
if  for any reason  these manufacturers do not find our products to be appropriate for their use  our current revenue levels and future growth will be adversely affected 
our sales and operating results can fluctuate significantly from period to period  which may adversely affect the market price of our stock 
our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could adversely affect sales or operating results  or lead to significant variability in our operating results 
in addition  because a significant portion of our revenue in any particular quarter has historically come from the sale of a relatively small number of systems  the loss of any sale could have a significant negative impact 
a variety of factors could cause this variability  including the following order cancellations or delays in orders by customers  the high selling prices of our nsx series and di series  which typically result in a long sales cycle  decreases in capital spending by our customers  particularly in light of current conditions in the microelectronic industries  new product introductions by our competitors and competitive pricing pressures  component shortages resulting in manufacturing delays  and delays in the development  introduction and manufacture of our products 
we cannot predict the impact of these and other factors on our revenues and operating results in any future period 
results of operations in any period  therefore  should not be considered indicative of the results to be expected for any future period 
because of this difficulty in predicting future performance  our operating results may fall below expectations of securities analysts or investors in some future quarter or quarters 
our failure to meet these expectations would likely adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
two product lines account for a significant portion of our sales  consequently  continued market acceptance of these product lines is critical to our success 
approximately of our net revenues came from the sales of our nsx series and approximately of our net revenues came from the sales of our di series 
although we intend to introduce new products in  we still expect that the nsx series and di series will continue to account for at least a majority of our net revenues for the next twelve months 
continued market acceptance of these product lines is critical to our success 
any decline in demand for or failure to achieve continued market acceptance of these product lines or any new version of these product lines  would harm our business 
the market acceptance of our new products is critical to our growth 
microelectronic device manufacturing equipment and processes are subject to rapid technological changes 
we continue to spend a significant amount of time and resources developing new systems  new models to existing system series and improvements or enhancements on current models for both our current and new markets and applications 
due to the length of the product development cycles in our industries  we must make these significant time and resource expenditures well in advance of any prospect of a revenue stream from such new products 
if our customers do not accept and integrate our new products into their operations  our revenue  cash flow  operating results or stock price could be negatively impacted 
if we are unable to develop and introduce successful new products and technologies in a timely manner  our business will be harmed 
the microelectronic capital equipment manufacturing business is a highly competitive business and microelectronic device manufacturing equipment and processes provided are subject to rapid technological changes 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to continue to enhance our existing product line to meet customer needs and to develop and introduce new products in a timely manner 
we cannot assure you that our product enhancement efforts to improve and advance products such as the nsx series and the di series  or our new product development efforts  will be successful or that we will be able to respond effectively to technological change or that we will choose the most opportunistic new markets and applications 
if we are unsuccessful  our expenses  revenue  operating results or stock price could be negatively impacted 
we continue to make and or review significant investments in research  development and engineering in new technology and or businesses with new or complementary products  services and or technologies  and we are aware of the numerous risks associated therewith  including but not limited to diversion of management s attention from day to day operational matters  lack of synergy  or the inability to realize expected synergies  failure to commercialize the new technology or business  worse than expected performance of the new technology or business  lower than expected market opportunities or market acceptance of any new products  and unexpected reduction of sales of existing products by new products 
if we are unsuccessful  our revenue  operating results or stock price could be negatively impacted 
our products are complex and any product or process development issues could negatively impact our operations or financial results 
our products are complex and often the applications of our customers are unique 
we believe that our future success will depend in part upon our ability to meet both our customers and our functionality and reliability requirements in a timely manner 
we cannot be sure that our product offerings  application assistance  enhancement efforts  or our new product development efforts will fulfill every functionality and reliability requirement of every customer 
in addition  new product offerings that are highly complex in terms of software or hardware may require application or service work such as bug fixing prior to acceptance thereby delaying revenue recognition 
if we are unsuccessful in these areas  our market share  revenue  operating results or stock price could be negatively impacted 
our operating results could be negatively impacted if we are unable to obtain the necessary resources to invest in our future 
although the microelectronic industries are currently in a severe and prolonged downturn  we intend to prepare for the next up turn in these industries by continuing to invest in certain areas of our business 
these investments may result in the need to spend significant amounts of cash to fund increases in research  development and engineering expenses  take advantage of unanticipated opportunities  such as strategic alliances or other special marketing opportunities  acquisitions of complementary businesses or assets  or the development of new products  and or respond to unanticipated developments  increasing customer demands or competitive pressures 
if our cash  together with cash available under our credit facility  is insufficient to meet these cash requirements  we will need to seek alternative sources of financing to carry out our growth and operating strategies 
we may not be able to raise needed cash on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
financing may be on terms that are dilutive or potentially dilutive 
in addition  our stock price has seen extreme fluctuations over the past year ranging from to and such fluctuations may continue in the future 
we believe various factors  including many beyond our control  are causing the volatility in all stocks in the technology sector 
the current low stock price may negatively impact our ability to raise capital through future equity financing  should such financing be desirable or needed 
as a result  if alternative sources of financing are required but are insufficient or unavailable  we will be required to modify our growth and operating plans to the extent of available funding 
our market is highly competitive and we may lose business to larger and better financed competitors 
the microelectronic defect inspection equipment industry is highly competitive in all areas of the world 
many other domestic and foreign companies participate in the same market as our nsx and di series systems and the industry is intensely competitive 
our current primary competitors in the market for microelectronic wafer defect inspection equipment are semiconductor technologies instruments  inc sti  robotic vision systems  inc  toray industries  inc 
and electroglas  inc 
we have entered into a settlement and stock purchase agreement to purchase all of the outstanding stock of sti and we currently expect to close the purchase in the second quarter of in addition  companies such as kla tencor corporation  applied materials  inc  rudolph technologies and photon dynamics  that are currently providing automated inspection products for the wafer manufacturing and processing market  may enter our market 
most of these competitors  as well as other potential competitors  have substantially greater financial resources and more extensive engineering  manufacturing  marketing and customer support capabilities than we have 
unless we are able to invest significant financial resources in developing products and enhancing customer support worldwide  and are able to gain customer acceptance of our products  we may not be able to compete effectively 
as we continue to diversify into the evolving and emerging microelectronic technologies and markets including semiconductors  advanced packaging  optoelectronics  photonics  mems or other micro machines  flat panel display  printheads  data storage  disk drives and other similar devices  further competitors may enter our markets  or we may enter the markets of other companies 
our success depends on attracting and retaining key personnel 
our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to recruit and retain highly skilled technical  manufacturing  managerial  financial and marketing personnel 
the labor market in which we operate is highly competitive and as a result  we may not be able to retain and recruit key personnel 
our failure to hire  retain  or adequately train key personnel could have a negative impact on our performance 
in addition  during this prolonged and extensive microelectronic industry downturn we have had reductions in our work force  reduced or eliminated salary increases and for certain periods implemented pay cuts at the management level  and reduced discretionary spending 
although we believe these measures have been strategically achieved to minimize disruption to our new product development  we recognize that any of the above measures may have long term effects on our business 
our business may be harmed if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights 
our success depends in part upon our ability to obtain intellectual property rights and licenses and to preserve other intellectual property rights covering our products and our products under development 
to protect these rights  we have obtained two domestic patents and intend to continue to seek patents on our inventions when appropriate 
as of december   we also have an increasing variety of pending patent applications in the united states and internationally and expect our portfolio to grow in the future 
the process of seeking intellectual property protection can be time consuming and expensive 
we cannot ensure that patents will be issued from currently pending or future applications  our existing patents or any new patents will be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us  foreign intellectual property laws will protect our intellectual property rights  or others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around our technology 
if we do not successfully protect and then enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
we also rely on trade secrets  proprietary know how and confidentiality provisions in agreements with employees  consultants  key customers and vendors to protect our intellectual property 
other parties may not comply with the terms of their agreements with us and we may not be able to adequately enforce our rights against these people 
third parties may claim that we are infringing upon their intellectual property and we could suffer significant litigation costs  licensing expenses or be prevented from selling our products 
intellectual property rights are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we may be unknowingly infringing upon the intellectual property rights of others and may be liable for that infringement  which could result in significant liability for us 
if we do infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others  we could be forced to either seek a license to those intellectual property rights or to alter our products so that they no longer infringe 
a license could be very expensive to obtain or may not be available at all 
similarly  changing our products or processes to avoid infringing upon the rights of others may be costly or impractical 
we are responsible for any patent litigation costs 
if we were to become involved in a dispute regarding intellectual property  whether ours or that of another company  we may have to participate in legal proceedings 
these types of proceedings may be costly and time consuming for us  even if we eventually prevail 
if we do not prevail  we might be forced to pay significant damages  obtain licenses  modify our products or processes  stop making products or stop using processes 
our dependence on a few significant customers exposes us to operating risks 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for of net revenues in  of net revenues in and of net revenues in in  we had two customers each account for more than ten percent of our business  with one accounting for almost sixteen percent 
our customers are able to cancel orders  prior to shipment  with few or no penalties 
if a significant customer reduces orders for any reason  our revenues  operating results and financial condition will be negatively affected 
in addition  our ability to increase our sales will depend in part upon our ability to obtain orders from new customers for whom there is intense competition 
our dependence on subcontractors and sole or limited source suppliers may prevent us from delivering an acceptable product on a timely basis and could result in disruption of our operations 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture many of the components and subassemblies for our products and we depend on single or limited source suppliers for some of our components 
our reliance on subcontractors gives us little control over the manufacturing process and exposes us to significant risks such as inadequate capacity  late delivery  substandard quality and high costs 
if a supplier were to become unable to provide parts in the volumes needed or at an acceptable price  we would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements from alternative sources of supply  or manufacture the components internally 
depending on the part  the process of qualifying subcontractors and suppliers generally takes between and days 
we have no written supply agreements with any of our single or limited source suppliers and purchase our custom components through individual purchase orders 
if we were unable to obtain these components in a timely fashion  we may not be able to meet demands for future shipments 
we believe that we would be able to find alternative solutions if supplies were unavailable from any of our sole source suppliers  including the supplier of our image processing component 
this may take time and the disruption would adversely affect our results of operations 
failure to accurately and timely adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents in inventory due to changing market conditions or customer acceptance of our products could adversely affect our consolidated financial statements including earnings 
our earnings could be harmed and our inventory levels could materially increase if we are unable to accurately and timely predict our inventory needs and adjust our orders for parts and subcomponents should our needs increase or decrease materially due to unexpected increases or decreases in demand for our products 
any material increase in our inventories could result in an adverse effect on our earnings  while any material decrease in our ability to procure needed inventories could result in an inability to supply customer demand for our products thus adversely affecting our revenues 
our dependence upon international customers and suppliers may reduce our revenues or impede our ability to supply products 
international sales have accounted for a significant and growing portion of our revenues in recent years and we expect that the percentage of sales from international customers will continue to increase 
sales outside of north america accounted for of our net revenues in  of our net revenues in and of our net revenues in in addition  we rely on non us suppliers for several components of the systems we sell 
as a result  a major part of our revenues and the ability to manufacture our products are subject to the risks associated with international commerce 
international sales and our relationships with suppliers may be hurt by many factors  including changes in law or policy resulting in burdensome government controls  tariffs  restrictions  embargoes or export license requirements  political or economic instability in our target international markets  longer payment cycles common in foreign markets  difficulties in staffing and managing our international operations  less favorable foreign intellectual property laws making it harder to protect our technology from appropriation by competitors  and difficulties in collecting our accounts receivable because of the geographic distance and different legal rules 
if our international sales or relationships with international suppliers are adversely affected by any of these factors  our financial condition could be adversely affected 
our operational results could be negatively impacted by currency fluctuations and other global business risks 
our foreign sales are made in us dollars 
a strengthening in the dollar relative to the currencies of those countries where we do business would increase the prices of our products as stated in those currencies and hurt our sales in those countries 
if we lower our prices to reflect a change in exchange rates  our profitability in those markets will decrease 
in the past  there have been significant fluctuations in the exchange rates between the dollar and the currencies in the countries where we do business 
we have not historically tried to reduce our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations by using hedging transactions 
however  we may choose to do so in the future 
we may not be able to do so successfully 
accordingly  we may experience economic loss and a negative impact on earnings and equity as a result of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we are also subject to risks associated with shipping products outside of the us including shipping delays  varying business conditions  differing business cultures  cultural diversities and export laws  among other risks 
failure to increase our sales in asia will negatively impact our financial performance 
asia is an important region for the markets we serve 
in the past year  pockets of asia have accounted for a growing percentage of our business 
we expect our dependence upon the asian market to increase 
in recent years  asia has experienced serious economic problems including currency devaluations  debt defaults  lack of liquidity and recessions 
our revenues depend upon the capital expenditures of microelectronic manufacturers  many of who have operations and customers in asia 
serious economic problems in asia would likely result in a significant decrease in the sale of equipment to microelectronic industries 
if we are unable to increase our sales in asia  our future financial condition  revenues and operating results will be negatively affected 
in addition  we opened an office in taiwan in where we directly sell and service our systems using our own employees 
when we opened the office  we believed the microelectronic industries in taiwan and surrounding countries would have significant sales potential 
we believe our and sales in taiwan justified the decision to open the office  however  should the current trend of continued growth in the taiwan market not occur  our future financial condition  revenues and operating results will be negatively affected 
although we have found that the opening of the office provided us with more control over our affairs and a direct sales and service force dedicated to our products  the opening of the office required a lease of a facility  the hiring of employees  the formation of a limited liability entity and opening of a taiwan branch  and other actions  all of which may increase our exposure 
due to the success of our taiwan office  we continue to pursue other direct sales opportunities where we believe significant sales potential exists and more control over our affairs is prudent  such as in pockets of europe where we have opened an office in the united kingdom 
although we believe that the use of a more direct sales and service force will provide us with more control over our affairs and dedication to our products  this approach may require a lease of a facility  the hiring of employees  the formation of a limited liability entity and other actions all of which may increase our exposure 
we will continue to rely upon distributors for a portion of our future sales  and a disruption in our relationships with these distributors could have a negative impact on our international sales 
a portion of our sales has been made through independent distributors 
although our sales through distributors decreased in  as compared to  we expect that sales through independent distributors will represent some portion of our sales for the next several years 
in  sales to our exclusive distributor in japan accounted for of our net revenues  sales to our exclusive distributor in asia excluding japan and taiwan for all of and excluding all of asia  except south korea  for may through december accounted for of our net revenues and sales to our distributors in europe accounted for of our net revenues 
the activities of these distributors are not within our control 
although we believe that we maintain good relations with our independent distributors  the relationships may nevertheless deteriorate in the future 
a reduction in the sales or service efforts or financial viability of any of our independent distributors  or a termination of our relationships with them  could harm our sales  our financial results and our ability to support our customers 
any acquisitions we may make could disrupt and harm our business 
on february  we entered into a settlement and purchase agreement with sti and its sole shareholder  asti holdings  ltd asti of singapore  to purchase all of the outstanding stock of sti and resolve any remaining disputes with asti and sti regarding our may stock purchase agreement with sti and asti which we terminated in august pursuant to the settlement and purchase agreement  we have agreed to purchase all of the outstanding stock of sti for a purchase price of million in cash and  shares of our common stock 
the agreement is subject to approval of the shareholders of asti and we expect to close the purchase in the second quarter of the closing of the proposed acquisition of sti remains subject to various risks  including the possibility that shareholders of asti will not approve the transaction or that other legal or regulatory issues may arise that prevent the closing 
even if the closing takes place  our ability to benefit from the acquisition will depend upon how quickly and effectively we integrate sti s operations and personnel with our business 
unanticipated difficulties or costs in this integration process may adversely affect our business 
if we are unable to close the acquisition  asti and sti may continue to seek resolution of disputes with respect to our may purchase agreement 
in august  we terminated the may purchase agreement and asserted that asti owed us a break up fee of million 
asti claimed that we had improperly terminated the agreement and asserted that we owed the million break up fee to them 
if we are unable to resolve this dispute by closing the proposed acquisition  resulting damage awards or the payment of the break up fee may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
whether or not we prevail  the legal expenses involved in any such proceeding may be material 
although we do not have any other specific plans or agreements to make any specific material acquisitions  we plan to pursue acquisitions of related businesses 
our identification of suitable acquisition candidates involves risks inherent in assessing the values  strengths  weaknesses  risks and profitability of acquisition candidates  including the effects of the possible acquisition on our business  diversion of our management s attention and risks associated with unanticipated problems or latent liabilities 
if we are successful in closing on the sti acquisition and or in pursuing other acquisitions  we may be required to expend significant funds  incur additional debt or issue additional securities  which may negatively affect our results of operations and be dilutive to our shareholders 
if we spend significant funds or incur additional debt  our ability to obtain financing for working capital or other purposes could decline and we may be more vulnerable to economic downturns and competitive pressures 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to finance acquisitions or that we will realize any anticipated benefits from acquisitions that we complete 
the process of reviewing and acquiring related businesses involve numerous risks  including but not limited to diversion of management s attention from other operational matters  lack of synergy  or the inability to realize expected synergies  resulting from the acquisition  failure to commercialize purchased technology  and acquired intangible assets becoming impaired as a result of technological advancements or worse than expected performance of the acquired company 
should we successfully acquire sti or another business  the process of integrating acquired operations into our existing operations may result in unforeseen operating difficulties and may require significant financial resources that would otherwise be available for the ongoing development or expansion of our existing business 
mergers and acquisitions are inherently risky and the inability to effectively manage these risks could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if a microelectronic device manufacturer is loyal to another microelectronic equipment supplier  we may be unable to sell our products to that potential customer and our sales and market share could suffer as a result 
we believe that once a microelectronic device manufacturer has selected one vendor s capital equipment for a production line application  the manufacturer generally relies upon that capital equipment and  to the extent possible  subsequent generations of the same vendor s equipment  for the life of the application 
once a vendor s equipment has been installed in a production line  a microelectronic device manufacturer must often make substantial technical modifications and may experience production line downtime in order to switch to another vendor s equipment 
accordingly  unless our systems offer performance or cost advantages that outweigh a customer s expense of switching to our systems  it will be difficult for us to achieve significant sales to that customer once it has selected another vendor s capital equipment for an application 
if we are required to account for stock options as a compensation expense  our net income and earnings per share will be significantly reduced 
some companies have begun to account for stock options as a compensation expense thus resulting in a reduction of their net income and earnings per share 
we currently grant all options at fair market value and do not record compensation expense in connection with the grants 
it is possible that future laws and regulations will require us to record the fair market value of all stock options as a compensation expense in our consolidated financial statements 
if such a change occurs  our net income and earnings per share will be significantly reduced 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to market risk primarily from changes in interest rates and credit risk 
we do not have material exposure to market risk from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates because all sales are made in us dollars 
interest rate risk we are exposed to interest rate risk primarily from investments in cash equivalents and short term and long term marketable debt securities the investment portfolio 
the entire investment portfolio is classified as available for sale and  accordingly  is recorded on the consolidated balance sheet at fair value based on quoted market prices  with unrealized gains and losses reported in shareholders equity under the caption accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
the entire investment portfolio is denominated in us dollars 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in the investment portfolio 
due to the short duration of our investment portfolio  an immediate percent change in interest rates is not expected to have a material adverse effect on our near term financial condition or results of operations 
credit risk financial instruments which potentially subject us to credit risk consist principally of securities in the investment portfolio and trade receivables 
we limit credit risk related to the investment portfolio by placing all investments with high credit quality issuers and limit the amount of investment with any one issuer 
as of december   of the investment portfolio consisted of government securities and corporate commercial paper and bonds with maturities of one year or less 
we limit credit risk associated with trade receivables by performing ongoing credit evaluations and believe that there is no additional risk beyond amounts provided for collection losses to be inherent in trade receivables
