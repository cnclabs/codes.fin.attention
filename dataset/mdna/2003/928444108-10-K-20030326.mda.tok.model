item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  the related notes thereto  and other financial information included elsewhere in this form k 
references to we  us or our refer to visual networks  inc on a consolidated basis 
overview from our incorporation in august through december  our principal objective was to secure sufficient equity financing to enable us to accelerate product development efforts of visual uptime for frame relay deployment and create the corporate infrastructure necessary to support these efforts 
we first shipped visual uptime in mid and began generating significant revenue during since our inception  we have focused on establishing relationships with service providers with the goal of having these service providers include our products into their infrastructure or in their service offerings to their subscribers 
consistent with this goal  we have established agreements with major service providers such as at t  bellsouth  earthlink  equant  sbc  sprint  verizon and worldcom 
during  and  we continued to focus on selling visual uptime and added to our product portfolio as a result of a series of acquisitions the netnet product  celltracer  in  the inverse products  visual ip insight and visual internet benchmark  in  and the avesta products  visual trinity and visual ewatcher  in during  we discontinued development and sales efforts of visual trinity and sold the visual internet benchmark service 
in  the remaining customer for our celltracer product  network associates  placed what they indicated would be final orders 
also  in  we continued to evaluate the future of the visual ewatcher and celltracer products 
in their current form  neither product produced significant revenue for the year ended december  we believe that the technology of both products may be useful to other products in the future and we are exploring alternatives for these products 
however  we decided not to focus our development or sales efforts on these products in therefore  we do not anticipate any significant revenue from these products during we continue to focus our sales efforts on visual uptime and visual ip insight 
we acquired avesta technologies  inc avesta on may  we believed that the acquisition of avesta would provide critical pieces to our strategy to become one of the largest network performance management vendors with one of the industry s broadest portfolios of products and functionality 
we also anticipated that the merger would bring us closer to providing a single vendor solution to the internet infrastructure management needs of customers  especially our intended integration of networks  systems and applications into a unified service view for service providers and their enterprise subscribers 
we expected to generate revenue from the avesta products of approximately million in instead  these products generated revenue of only million in  and significantly increased our operating expenses 
subsequent to the acquisition  we concluded that  without significant modifications  the primary avesta product  trinity  was not a viable solution for our strategic service provider customers 
the product was more specifically targeted to direct enterprise customers  which did not fit with our service provider focused business plan 
as a result of an analysis performed in early by a company wide task force  we determined that the time and expense required to make the visual trinity product competitive in its market space and more suitable to our service provider customers would be prohibitive 
these factors  in conjunction with revenue declines in our other products  resulted in a million impairment charge and million in restructuring charges in in  we discontinued the visual trinity product  resulting in million in additional impairment charges related to the remaining intangible assets from the avesta acquisition  million in a write down related to an investment that was acquired with avesta that was determined to be impaired as of december  and million net of reversals in restructuring charges 
we did not have any significant remaining assets related to avesta included in our balance sheet as of december  or following the acquisition of avesta  we allowed our business strategy to become less focused  which increased the complexity of our business and adversely affected our results of operations 
we incurred significant losses from the second quarter of through the fourth quarter of the deterioration of our operating results that began in  excluding the effects of the impairment and restructuring charges and the write off of in process research and development  was due primarily to decreased revenue and increased operating expenses following the avesta acquisition 
in response  we made significant reductions in operating expenses in the remainder of  and by closing three facilities and by reducing our workforce by approximately employees from october through december  including approximately of whom were terminated during despite the growth of data networking  was a challenging year as our customers continued reducing spending 
one of our most significant customers  worldcom  filed chapter bankruptcy in july even with the bankruptcies of worldcom and a number of emerging service providers  and the general economic downturn of the telecommunications market  we were able to achieve profitability  limit our accounts receivable losses and maintain our cash balances 
this was accomplished due primarily to the following factors o our business is not related to the build out of telecommunications infrastructure  but rather is tied to the sale and deployment of data networking services to enterprises  o in march  we issued million in convertible debentures to improve our cash position  o throughout  we significantly reduced operating expenses and realigned them with our lower revenue expectations 
research and development expense  sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense declined from million in to million in  and o in july  we executed an agreement  later amended  with worldcom that stipulated payment terms while worldcom is in bankruptcy  enabling us to continue to sell our products to worldcom during its restructuring period 
we generated million in revenue from worldcom during  and incurred million in bad debts 
we cannot assure you that we will continue to generate this level of revenue from sales of our products to worldcom during we returned to profitability for the three months ended march  and have remained profitable since then 
however  we have continued to experience declining revenue from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december   including a reduction in the sale of each of our major products 
visual uptime revenue decreased by million due to a decrease in demand reflecting the overall downturn in the telecommunications industry  which was reflected in a slowdown in demand for telecommunications products and services  including those based on our products  tighter inventory control at our service provider customers  specifically at t  and the loss of business to competitors 
revenue from the visual ip insight product decreased million resulting from decreased demand due to the bankruptcies of many of the new internet service providers isps that were our primary targets for visual ip insight 
in addition  revenue from the visual ip insight product often fluctuates significantly from year to year due to the sizeable orders from a limited number of service providers that we are dependent upon for sales of that product 
such fluctuations can also significantly affect our gross margin percentage because our software costs of revenue are so insignificant 
the million decrease in revenue from visual internet benchmark  visual trinity  visual ewatcher and celltracer reflects  respectively  the sale of visual internet benchmark and the discontinuation of sales of visual trinity  visual ewatcher and celltracer 
we have refocused our sales  marketing and other efforts on our core visual uptime and visual ip insight products  our core service provider customers and service creation over resale to end users 
we have directed our visual ip insight development efforts at making the product more suitable for our core service provider customers and enabling the use of our product in higher margin broadband networks over  for example  cable lines and digital subscriber lines dsl 
we have also aggressively reduced our operating expenses to be more in line with our reduced revenue projections 
while we do not know when the downturn in telecommunications industry will end  or how robust the recovery will be once or if it does begin  we have revised our business plan to reflect lower projected revenue and reduced our operating expenses as we seek to remain profitable even with this reduced demand 
there can be no assurance that we will remain profitable 
based on our current cost structure  including changes made during the fourth quarter of  our ability to generate net income in the future is  in large part  dependent on our success in achieving quarterly revenue of at least million  achieving quarterly gross margins of to and maintaining or further reducing operating expenses 
due to market conditions  competitive pressures  and other factors beyond our control  there can be no assurances that we will be able to meet these goals 
in the event that the anticipated revenue goals are not met  we may not be profitable and we may be required to further reduce our cost structure

our primary sales and marketing strategy depends predominantly on sales of visual uptime and visual ip insight to telecommunications service providers 
service providers use our products as operations tools in their own network infrastructures  base value added services on our products and resell our products to their customers 
pressure on capital expenditures and the decline in the telecommunications markets may delay the rollout of new services based on our products 
furthermore  any potential reduction in demand for value added services or products from the service providers customers would directly impact the volume of our products purchased 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenue in will be attributable to sales of visual uptime and visual ip insight to service providers 
the loss of any one of at t  sprint or worldcom  which together have historically provided a majority of our revenue  would result in a substantial loss of revenue that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
for the year ended december   at t  sprint and worldcom represented  and  respectively  our consolidated revenue 
revenue related to all service providers represented   and of our consolidated revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
this concentration should continue because our customer base consists predominantly of service providers 
existing service provider customers are not easily replaced because of the relatively few participants in that market 
high barriers to entry due to extraordinary capital requirements and the increased possibility that existing service providers may merge or fail because of the current downturn in the telecommunications industry  may further reduce their number and make replacing a significant network service provider customer very difficult in the future 
furthermore  the small number of network service providers means that the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders or a delay in shipment of our products to any one service provider customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue for a quarter 
our anticipated dependence on sizable orders from a limited number of service provider customers will make the relationship between us and each service provider critically important to our business 
further  because none of our agreements contain minimum purchase requirements  there can be no assurance that the issuance of a purchase order will result in significant recurring business 
compared with revenue 
our revenue can be divided into three types hardware  software  and support and services 
each of our products has components of each revenue type 
sales of visual uptime are primarily classified as hardware revenue 
we also sell licenses related to visual uptime that are classified as software revenue 
sales of visual ip insight are primarily classified as software revenue 
however  sales of our newest hardware product  the ip service element ise  which embeds certain visual ip insight functionality in a hardware device  are classified as hardware revenue 
sales of visual ewatcher  prior to discontinuation in  are classified as software revenue 
sales of visual trinity  prior to discontinuation in may  were classified as software revenue 
sales of our visual ip insight subscription service  which we no longer offer to our customers  were classified as support and services revenue 
sales of the visual internet benchmark service  prior to sale of that product in june  were classified as support and services revenue 
royalties from the visual internet benchmark service are classified as support and services revenue 
sales of celltracer are classified as hardware revenue 
sales of technical support  professional services and training for all of our products are classified as support and services revenue 
total revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
sales to all service providers increased from approximately of revenue in to in we anticipate that the percentage of revenue attributable to our service providers for will be consistent with the levels achieved during hardware revenue 
hardware revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in demand for visual uptime from at t  sprint and worldcom 
we believe  in general  that the decrease in demand for visual uptime was primarily the result of the overall downturn in the telecommunications industry  which was reflected in a slowdown in demand for telecommunications products and services and reduced spending 
more specifically  we believe that revenue from at t decreased due to tighter inventory control and revenue from sprint and worldcom decreased due to the loss of market share of these customers to their competitors coupled with our loss of business to our competitors 
we do not believe that the recent events at worldcom had a significant impact on our revenue from worldcom for however  there is a risk that worldcom s bankruptcy could adversely affect our future revenue 
the decrease was also due to decreased revenue from celltracer of million due to decreased demand from nai 
software revenue 
software revenue was million in compared to million in  an increase of million 
the increase in software revenue was due primarily to an increase of million in licenses for visual uptime resulting from kentrox licenses  cisco licenses and other license upgrades for visual uptime 
in addition  even though total visual ip insight revenue decreased in  license revenue related to that product increased by million 
this increase is due to more license sales that replaced the sale of the visual ip insight subscription service in following the discontinuation of our subscription service 
since  we sell visual ip insight as a software license only 
prior to september   we offered both a subscription service and software licenses for that product 
these combined increases are offset by decreases in license revenue of million from visual trinity and visual ewatcher following the discontinuation of those products 
support and services revenue 
support and services revenue was million in and million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in support and services revenue was due primarily to decreased revenue from the visual trinity product  visual ewatcher product and visual internet benchmark service of million due to expired contracts that have not renewed as a result of the discontinuation of these products 
subscription fees for visual ip insight decreased by approximately million as customers have migrated to a perpetual license for that product 
the larger installed base of our visual uptime product for which we are selling technical support and the accelerated recognition of terminated technical support for celltracer as a result of the transfer of the source code to nai offsets these combined decreases 
we will continue to recognize revenue from the visual internet benchmark service that was sold during  for existing contracts under which we are still required to perform services through may  all of which is currently in deferred revenue 
we also receive royalty payments from the purchaser on new contracts 
cost of revenue and gross profit 
cost of revenue consists of subcontracting costs  component parts  warehouse costs  direct compensation costs  warranty and other contractual obligations  royalties  license fees and other overhead expenses related to the manufacturing operations 
product cost of revenue includes both hardware and software cost of revenue in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
cost of revenue related to software sales has not been significant 
support and services cost of revenue includes outsourced benchmark services  professional services and technical support costs 
total cost of revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
gross profit was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
gross profit margin was of revenue in as compared to of revenue in the increase in gross profit margin percentage was due primarily to the overall high gross margin of our new visual uptime and releases  decreased lower margin celltracer revenue  decreased fixed costs such as fees paid to third parties to provide the visual ip insight subscription service and visual internet benchmark service to customers for which we had existing contracts and overall decreased fixed costs in our manufacturing and support operations due to our cost reduction initiatives implemented since the fourth quarter of our future gross margins may be affected by a number of factors  including product mix  the proportion of sales to service providers  competitive pricing  manufacturing volumes and an increase in the cost of component parts 
based on our current product offerings and the level of fixed cost reductions that has been achieved to date  we expect our future margins to be in the range of to product cost of revenue 
product cost of revenue  which includes both hardware and software cost of revenue  was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
our software costs of revenue are insignificant 
the gross profit margin attributable to products was and in and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit margin was due primarily to the overall high gross margin of our new visual uptime and releases  decreased low gross margin celltracer revenue and overall decreased fixed costs in our manufacturing and support operations due to our cost cutting initiatives implemented since the fourth quarter of support and services cost of revenue 
support and services cost of revenue  which includes visual internet benchmark services  visual ip insight subscription services  professional services and technical support costs  was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the gross profit margin attributable to support and services was and in and  respectively 
the increase in gross profit margin was due primarily to decreased fixed costs such as fees paid to third parties to provide the visual ip insight subscription service and visual internet benchmark service to customers for which we had existing contracts 
operating expenses 
research and development expense 
research and development expense consists primarily of compensation for research and development staff  depreciation of test and development equipment  certain software development costs and costs of prototype materials 
research and development expense was million for compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to the full period effect of workforce reductions and facility closures that occurred in and additional workforce reductions during research and development expense was and of revenue in and  respectively 
we intend to incur research and development expense at or below the level of such expense in as a result of our continued focus on the control of operating expenses 
sales and marketing expense 
sales and marketing expense consists of compensation for the sales and marketing staff  commissions  pre sales support  travel and entertainment expense  trade shows and other marketing programs 
sales and marketing expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million

general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expense consists of the costs of executive management  finance  administration and other activities 
general and administrative expense was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in general and administrative expense was due primarily to the full period effect of workforce reductions and facility closures that occurred in and additional workforce reductions during general and administrative expense was and of revenue in and  respectively 
we intend to incur general and administrative expense at or below the level of such expense in as a result of our continued focus on the control of operating expenses 
restructuring and impairment charges 
during the second quarter of  we reversed million of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of due primarily to lower than estimated costs related to facility closures 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the second quarter of that consisted primarily of severance and other termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately employees and lease costs and leasehold improvement write offs related to the closure of our new york facility following our announcement to discontinue the visual trinity product 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed million of the restructuring charge recorded in the second quarter of due to lower than estimated costs related to facility closures and other contractual obligations 
we recorded another restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of that consisted of severance and other termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately people resulting from our continued focus on the reduction of our operating expenses see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
there were no restructuring or impairment charges in costs associated with the workforce reductions in of approximately employees have been charged to operating expenses as incurred 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in the second quarter of as a result of our discontinuation of the visual trinity product 
we also recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to the impairment of an investment acquired with the avesta acquisition and the write off of the remaining intangible assets related to the avesta acquisition as a result of our plans for the ewatcher product see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
we recorded million in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in related to the avesta acquisition 
all amounts of goodwill and other intangible assets were amortized or written off as of december  therefore  no amortization was recorded during interest income expense  net 
interest income  net  was million in compared to interest expense of million in the decrease of million was due primarily to both cash and non cash interest expense related to the convertible debentures we issued in march see note of notes to consolidated financial statements plus interest expense incurred on borrowings under our line of credit facility prior to payment and cancellation of the line offset by interest income on cash balances after the issuance of the convertible debentures 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for was million and related primarily to state income taxes and other non recoverable income tax payments 
there was no provision for income taxes for net income loss 
net loss for was million as compared to net income of million for  an increase of million 
the increase was due primarily to decreases in cost of sales  operating expenses  restructuring and impairment charges and amortization of intangible assets offset by decreased revenue 
compared with revenue 
total revenue was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
hardware revenue 
hardware revenue  which includes revenue from sales of visual uptime and visual celltracer  was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in celltracer revenue of million  from one customer  with the remaining decrease in visual uptime revenue  primarily from service providers and value added resellers 
the decrease in celltracer revenue was due to reduced demand from nai 
the decrease in sales of visual uptime was due primarily to a decrease in purchases from sprint and worldcom due to the loss of market share of one of these service providers to its competitors and to increased market penetration by a competitor 
as a result  the overall decrease was due to decreased demand for visual uptime and celltracer 
sales to all service providers increased from approximately of revenue for to for software revenue 
software revenue  which includes revenue from sales of visual ip insight  visual trinity  and ewatcher  was million in compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in software revenue was due primarily to the discontinuation of the visual trinity product  the primary product acquired from avesta  and decreased revenue from ip insight 
support and services revenue 
support and services revenue  which includes revenue from sales of visual internet benchmark  professional services and technical support  was million and million  an increase of million 
the increase in support and services revenue was due primarily to the larger installed base of our visual uptime product for which we are selling technical support and the full year effect of the support related to the visual trinity product 
cost of revenue and gross profit 
total cost of revenue was million for compared to million for  a decrease of million 
gross profit was million for compared to million for  a decrease of million 
gross profit margin was of revenue for as compared to of revenue for product cost of revenue 
product cost of revenue  which includes both hardware and software cost of revenue  was million for compared to million for  a decrease of million 
our software costs of revenue are insignificant 
the gross profit margin attributable to products was for and for the decrease in gross profit margin was due primarily to fewer high gross margin software sales due primarily to the discontinuation of the visual trinity product 
support and services cost of revenue 
support and services cost of revenue  which includes visual internet benchmark services  professional services and technical support costs  was million for compared to million for  an increase of million 
the gross profit margin attributable to support and services was for and for the decrease in gross profit margin was due primarily to higher fixed costs to support the visual internet benchmark service for existing contracts 
operating expenses 
research and development expense 
research and development expense was million for compared to million in  a decrease of million 
the decrease in research and development expense was due primarily to workforce reductions and facility closures during and research and development expense was and of revenue for and  respectively 
write off of purchased research and development 
a write off of purchased research and development costs of million was recorded in in connection with the acquisition of avesta 
avesta had in process technology which represented research and development projects of avesta that had not reached technological feasibility and that had no alternative future use in research and development activities or otherwise 
we charged as an expense as of the acquisition date amounts assigned to in process research and development ipr d  which met the foregoing criteria 
the evaluated projects were future releases of the trinity  ewatcher and other products 
the products in process included both upgrades to existing products as well as major modifications for future releases 
additional products that had been started but not yet assigned a numerical designation and were considered to be approximately complete were excluded from the evaluation 
the trinity related projects represented the majority of the value assigned to the ipr d projects 
we valued the acquired ipr d based upon an independent appraisal 
the values of the ipr d projects were determined by estimating the future cash flows from the projects  once commercially feasible  discounting the net cash flows back to their present values and then applying a percentage of completion to the calculated values to reflect the uncertainty of technical success of the projects 
the rates used to discount the net cash flows to their present values were based on avesta s weighted average cost of capital 
the percentage of completion was based on management s estimates of the amount of resources spent to date and on the expected use of future resources 
as of the valuation date  avesta was offering version of the trinity product 
versions  and were considered ipr d projects and were estimated to be  and complete  respectively 
the ewatcher product had been acquired by avesta in and versions and were considered ipr d projects and were estimated to be and complete  respectively 
certain risks and uncertainties are associated with the completion of the development of these products within a reasonable projected period of time 
each of the acquired ipr d projects had not demonstrated technological feasibility as of the acquisition date

restructuring and impairment charges 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of that consisted primarily of severance and other termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately employees and lease costs and leasehold improvement write offs related to the closure of facilities in ottawa  canada and sunnyvale  california and the reduction in size of our facilities in rockville  maryland and new york  new york 
these facility closures were the result of our efforts to consolidate and integrate the acquisition of avesta as well as an effort to downsize our operations and reduce our cost structure 
during the second quarter of  we reversed million of the restructuring charge recorded in the fourth quarter of due primarily to lower than estimated costs related to facility closures 
we recorded a restructuring charge of million in the second quarter of that consisted primarily of severance and other termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately employees and lease costs and leasehold improvement write offs related to the closure of our new york facility following our announcement to discontinue the visual trinity product 
during the fourth quarter of  we reversed million of the restructuring charge recorded in the second quarter of due to lower than estimated costs related to facility closures and other contractual obligations 
we recorded another restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of that consisted of severance and other termination benefits related to a workforce reduction of approximately people resulting from our continued focus on the reduction of our operating expenses see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of for the write off of goodwill and other intangibles related to the avesta acquisition 
we recorded an additional impairment charge of million in the second quarter of as a result of our discontinuation of the visual trinity product 
we also recorded an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to the impairment of an investment acquired with the avesta acquisition and the write off of the remaining intangible assets related to the avesta acquisition as a result of our plans for the ewatcher product see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
amortization of acquired intangibles 
we recorded million in amortization of goodwill and other intangibles in related to the avesta acquisition compared with million in the decrease was the result of decreased goodwill and intangibles resulting from the impairment charges recorded in and interest income  net 
interest income  net  was million for compared to million for the decrease of million was due primarily to decreased cash balances 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes for was million and related primarily to state income taxes and other non recoverable income tax payments 
net loss 
net loss for was million as compared to million for  a decrease of million 
the decrease was due primarily to a decrease in restructuring and impairment charges  amortization of intangibles and operating expenses  offset in part by decreases in revenue  gross profit  interest income and income tax benefits 
liquidity and capital resources at december   our unrestricted cash balance was million compared to million as of december   an increase of million 
this increase was due primarily to million in cash received from the issuance of convertible debentures  net of issuance costs  in march  offset by the payment of the outstanding balances under our credit facility and capital leases 
we used million of cash to purchase equipment and other fixed assets  made principal payments on capital lease obligations of million and made principal payments on our credit facility obligations of million 
cash provided by the sale of common stock pursuant to the exercise of employee stock options and our employee stock purchase plan was million 
we require substantial working capital to fund our business  particularly to finance inventories  accounts receivable  research and development activities and capital expenditures 
to date  we have financed our operations and capital expenditures primarily with the proceeds from our initial public offering completed in february  our operating income and the proceeds from the issuance of convertible debentures in march in  we became dependent on cash that was provided by our bank under a credit facility 
in addition  from time to time  we have obtained advance payments in connection with certain customer purchase orders 
in the fourth quarter of  we received an advance payment of approximately million that was classified as a customer deposit in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet as of december   the related customer orders were fulfilled in february we do not anticipate receiving customer advance payments in the future 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the rate of revenue growth  if any  as well as our gross margins and our levels of operating expenses  including product research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses 
our revenue for was million  which was a decrease of million compared to in response to the trends of decreasing revenue and increasing operating expenses that began in the second quarter of following our acquisition of avesta  we initiated a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of to realign our product portfolio  streamline our operations and devote resources to the markets and products that we believe have the greatest opportunity for growth 
in  we announced a plan to discontinue development and sales efforts on the visual trinity product  the primary product acquired from avesta  and eliminate the related costs 
also in  we sold the visual internet benchmark service and discontinued our subscription service of visual ip insight 
in  the remaining customer for our celltracer product  network associates placed what they indicated would be final orders with us for this product 
also  in  we continued to evaluate the future of the visual ewatcher and celltracer products 
in their current form  neither product produced significant revenue for the year ended december  we believe that the technology of both products may be useful to other products in the future and we are exploring alternatives for these technologies 
however  we decided not to focus our development or sales efforts on these products in therefore  we do not anticipate any significant revenue from these products during in  and  we made significant reductions in staff and other operating costs 
as a result of these actions  research and development expense  sales and marketing expense and general and administrative expense  were reduced from a level of million for to million for as a result these cost reductions  we returned to profitability in the first quarter of and have remained profitable since then 
our ability to generate operating income in the future is dependent upon not only our continued success in reducing operating expenses  but also our ability to sustain revenue 
general market conditions  competitive pressures and other factors beyond our control may adversely affect our ability to generate sufficient revenue to enable us to remain profitable 
our ability to sustain revenue may be negatively affected by our dependence on sales to our service providers 
pressure on capital expenditures and the decline in the telecommunications industry may delay the rollout of new services offered by our service providers based on our products 
furthermore  any potential reduction in demand for value added services or products from the service providers customers directly impacts the volume of our products purchased and may impact our ability to sustain revenue 
we do not believe that the recent events at worldcom had a significant impact on our revenue from worldcom in however  worldcom s bankruptcy could have a material adverse impact on our future revenue 
as of december   worldcom owed us million that is included in accounts receivable in the accompanying balance sheet 
we wrote off approximately million in accounts receivable related to amounts worldcom owed to us prior to the bankruptcy filing against the allowance for bad debts during any future recoveries of these written off receivables will be recorded when and if they are received 
subsequent to december   we entered into an agreement to sell these previously written off receivables to an unrelated third party for approximately million 
we anticipate that this cash will be collected and recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense during the three months ended march the current level of our operating expenses  which include a substantial fixed component in the form of compensation  other employee related costs  occupancy costs and other costs incurred under contractual arrangements  is based  in part  on our expectation of future revenue 
in the event that the anticipated cost reductions are not realized or we do not meet our revenue goals  we may be required to further reduce our cost structure 
while we are able to further reduce these expenses  should reductions become appropriate  it would take at least thirty to ninety days for the full effects of any such further expense reductions to be realized 
if revenue levels are below expectations  operating results are likely to be materially and adversely affected because we may not be able to reduce operating expenses in sufficient time to compensate for an unexpected reduction in revenue 
there can be no assurances that we will be able to sustain revenue or remain profitable 
failure to sustain revenue and remain profitable coupled with our limited capital resources and significant accumulated deficit could also result in our inability to continue as a going concern 
the significant operating losses incurred by us since the second quarter of through the end of have resulted in a significant reduction in our cash 
in order to strengthen our financial position and provide cash for working capital purposes  in march  we issued senior secured convertible debentures in the aggregate amount of million in a private placement 
the debentures are due march   are payable in common stock or cash  at our option provided certain conditions are satisfied  and bear interest at an annual rate of payable quarterly in common stock or cash  at our option  provided certain conditions are satisfied 
the debentures are secured by a first priority lien on substantially all of our assets which is to be released based on the achievement  as documented in this annual report  of certain financial goals 
the debentures may be converted initially into  shares of our common stock at the option of the holders at a price of per share  subject to certain adjustments 
the conversion price will adjust if we issue certain additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into common stock at a price that is less than the conversion price of the debentures 
we have the right to require the holders to convert their debentures into common stock if the closing price of our common stock exceeds of the conversion price for consecutive days after september  in connection with the issuance of the debentures  we also issued warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock at an initial exercise price of per share 
the exercise price may be adjusted if we issue certain additional shares of our common stock or instruments convertible into common stock at a lower price than the initial exercise price 
the warrants expire on march  the holders of the debentures also received the right to purchase shares of to be created series a preferred stock the preferred stock rights at certain dates in the future 
the first preferred stock right for shares for million expired on may  the holders did not exercise the right to purchase these shares of series a preferred stock 
a second preferred stock right for shares for million may be exercised at any time after the six month anniversary but before the fifteen month anniversary of the issuance of the debentures 
a third preferred stock purchase right for shares for million also expired on may  the holders did not exercise the right to purchase these shares of series a preferred stock 
the debenture holders were also granted certain equity participation and registration rights 
under the terms of the debentures  a number of events could trigger the debenture holders right to force early repayment of of the outstanding principal plus accrued and unpaid interest owed under the debentures 
events constituting a triggering event include o our default on other indebtedness or obligations under any other debenture  any mortgage  credit agreement or other facility  indenture agreement  factoring agreement or other instrument under which there may be issued  or by which there may be secured or evidenced  any indebtedness for borrowed money or money due under any long term leasing or factoring arrangement in an amount exceeding million  o failure to have our common stock listed on an eligible market  o our bankruptcy  o engaging in certain change in control  sale of assets or redemption transactions  o failure to timely file our annual report  and o certain other failures to perform our obligations under the debenture agreement and or the related agreements 
in addition  the debentures include certain financial covenants related to and we met the financial covenant for if our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  less capital expenditures  for the year ended december  are less than million  our debenture holders may require that we prepay all or a portion of up to of the outstanding principal amount of their debentures  plus accrued interest 
the redemption may be made in common stock or cash at our option provided certain conditions are satisfied 
if we do not have sufficient cash to repay these amounts early and are required to do so  we may be required to seek additional capital through a sale of assets  sale of additional securities or through additional borrowings  none of which may be available on terms reasonably acceptable to us 
in connection with the issuance of the debentures  the outstanding amounts borrowed from the bank under our accounts receivable based and our equipment financing arrangements were repaid  and the related loan agreements were terminated 
the standby letter of credit  as amended  issued by the bank in december in the amount of million with an expiration date of september  remains outstanding and secured with our pledge of a certificate of deposit in the amount of million that matures on may  proceeds from the issuance of the million of debentures significantly improved our cash position and working capital  and our cash position and working capital have continued to improve as a result of our cash flow from operations 
our balance of cash and cash equivalents was million as of december   up million from december  accounts payable and accrued expenses totaled million at december   down million from december   and current assets exceeded current liabilities by approximately million as of december  based on our current cost structure coupled with changes made during the fourth quarter of  our ability to generate net income in the future is  in large part  dependent on our success in achieving quarterly revenue of at least million  achieving quarterly gross margins of to and maintaining or further reducing operating expenses 
due to market conditions  competitive pressures  and other factors beyond our control  there can be no assurances that we will be able to meet these goals 
in the event that the anticipated revenue goals are not met  we may be required to further reduce our cost structure 
future minimum payments as of december  under the debentures and non cancelable operating leases are as follows in thousands operating debentures leases thereafter total minimum payments   interest element of payments  present value of future minimum payments 
 unamortized debt discount  current portion long term portion  we have purchase commitments for inventory purchased by certain suppliers on our behalf 
if such inventory is not used within a specified period of time  we discontinue a product for which the suppliers have made purchases or we terminate a relationship with the supplier for which we have set minimum inventory requirements  we are required to purchase the inventory from the suppliers 
additionally  if we cancel a purchase order placed on a supplier  we may be subject to certain costs and fees 
we do not engage in any off balance sheet financing arrangements 
in particular  we do not have any interest in so called limited purpose entities  which include special purpose entities and structured finance entities 
the future success of our company will be dependent upon  among other factors  our ability to generate adequate cash for operating and capital needs 
we are relying on our existing balance of cash and cash equivalents together with future sales and the collection of the related accounts receivable  at least at the levels set forth in our business plan  to meet our future cash requirements for at least the next twelve months 
if cash provided by these sources is not sufficient  we will be required to further reduce our expenditures for operations or to seek additional capital through other means that may include the sale of assets  the sale of equity securities or additional borrowings 
there can be no assurance that additional capital will be available  or available on terms that are reasonable or acceptable to us 
if we are unable to generate additional cash  our business and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected such that we may need to consider other alternatives for our future 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we consider the accounting policies related to revenue recognition and inventory valuation to be critical to the understanding of our results of operations 
our critical accounting policies also include the areas where we have made the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in making estimates  and where these estimates can significantly impact our financial results under different assumptions and conditions 
we prepare our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from hardware  software and support and services 
our revenue recognition policies follow the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop no 
 software revenue recognition and sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which summarizes existing accounting literature and requires that four criteria be met prior to the recognition of revenue 
our accounting policies regarding revenue recognition are written to comply with the following criteria see note of notes to consolidated financial statements persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is probable 
the third and fourth criteria may require us to make significant judgments or estimates 
to determine if a fee is fixed or determinable  we evaluate rights of return  customer acceptance rights  if applicable  and multiple element arrangements of products and services to determine the impact on revenue recognition 
our agreements generally have not included rights of return except in certain reseller relationships that include stock rotation rights 
if offered  rights of return only apply to hardware 
if an agreement provides for a right of return  we typically recognize revenue when the right has expired or the product has been resold by the master distributor 
if we have sufficient historical information to allow us to make an estimate of returns in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 revenue recognition when right of return exists  we defer an estimate for such returns and recognize the remainder at the date of shipment 
if an agreement provides for evaluation or customer acceptance  we recognize revenue upon the completion of the evaluation process  acceptance of the product by the customer and completion of all other criteria 
most of our sales are multiple element arrangements and include hardware  software  and technical support 
our software sales sometimes include professional services for implementation but these services are not a significant source of our revenue 
training is also offered but is not a significant source of our revenue 
revenue from multiple element arrangements is recognized using the residual method whereby the fair value of any undelivered elements  such as customer support and services  is deferred and any residual value is allocated to the software and recognized as revenue upon delivery 
the fair values of any undelivered elements  typically professional services  technical support and training  have been determined based on our specific objective evidence of fair value  which is based on the price that we charge customers when the element is sold separately 
our maintenance contracts require us to provide technical support and unspecified software updates to customers on a when and if available basis 
we recognize customer support revenue  including support revenue that is bundled with product sales  ratably over the term of the contract period  which generally ranges from one to three years 
we recognize revenue from services when the services are performed 
subscription fees for our benchmark reports are recognized upon delivery of the reports 
the remaining subscription fees will be complete in may when the final contract under which we are obligated to provide service will be complete 
we sell our products directly to service providers  through indirect channels and to end user customers 
certain reseller customers have stock rotation rights  under which the customer can exchange previously purchased products for other products of equal or greater cost  subject to certain limitations  based on their end user customers requirements 
we recognize revenue under these arrangements once the stock rotation right expires or the product has been resold by our master distributor 
we also examine the specific facts and circumstances of all sales arrangements with payment terms extending beyond our normal payment terms to make a determination of whether the sales price is fixed or determinable and whether collectibility is probable 
payment terms are not tied to milestone deliverables or customer acceptance 
our evaluation of the impact on revenue recognition  if any  includes our history with our customers and the specific facts of each arrangement 
it is generally not our practice to offer payment terms that differ from our normal payment terms  and we have not written off any accounts receivable related to extended payment term arrangements 
inventory because of the order lead times required to obtain manufactured product  we must maintain sufficient quantities of inventory of all of our products to meet expected demand 
if actual demand is much lower than forecasted  we may not be able to dispose of our inventory at or above its cost 
we write down our inventory for estimated excess and obsolete amounts to the lower of cost or market value 
the estimates are based on historical trends  forecasts and specific customer or transaction information 
it is generally our policy to write down inventory to the amount that we expect to sell within a one year period 
if future demand is lower than currently estimated  additional write downs of our inventory may be required 
allowance for bad debt we grant credit terms without collateral to our customers and  prior to  had not experienced any significant credit related losses 
during  the company wrote off approximately million in receivable balances due from worldcom  following worldcom s bankruptcy filing against the allowance for bad debts 
any future recoveries of these written off receivables will be recorded when and if they are received 
subsequent to december   we entered into an agreement to sell these previously written off receivables to an unrelated third party for approximately million 
we anticipate that this cash will be collected and recorded as a reduction of bad debt expense during the three months ended march  accounts receivable include allowances to record receivables at their estimated net realizable value  which is determined based on estimates for bad debt 
the estimates are based on historical information and specific review of outstanding receivables at the end of each reporting period 
if future events occur that impact our customers  additional write downs of our accounts receivable may be required 
additional risk factors in addition to the other information provided or incorporated by reference in this document  stockholders should also consider the following factors carefully in evaluating whether to make an investment decision 
stockholders should also refer to the section entitled forward looking statements 
we have an accumulated deficit of million 
the acquisition of avesta in may added a significant level of operating expenses to our company without a commensurate addition of revenue at the same time as we began to feel the effects of the economic downturn in the telecommunications sector in our core hardware business 
these factors  plus the effects of impairment and restructuring charges  amortization of intangible assets and the write off of in process research and development  all of which were recorded in connection with the acquisition of avesta  have resulted in an accumulated deficit of million as of december  as a result  we could be unable to raise equity financing  to arrange bank financing or to arrange credit from suppliers on reasonable or acceptable terms 
we may not be profitable in the future 
our ability to generate operating income in the future is  in large part  dependent on our success in sustaining revenue and reducing operating expenses 
research and development expense  sales and marketing expense and general administrative expense decreased from million in to million in however  revenue declined from million in to million in market conditions  competitive pressures  and other factors beyond our control  may adversely affect our ability to adequately sustain revenue in the future 
in particular  our ability to sustain revenue may be negatively affected by our dependence on our service provider customers  including worldcom 
pressure on capital expenditures in and the decline of the telecommunications industry may delay the roll out of new services based on our products offered by our service provider customers 
any potential reduction in demand for value added services or products  which our products support  from the service providers customers  directly impacts the purchase volume of our products and may impact our ability to sustain revenue 
worldcom  one of our largest customers  declared bankruptcy during and there is no guarantee that it will be able to emerge from bankruptcy protection or that we will continue to achieve significant levels of revenue from worldcom in the future 
we are uncertain as to whether bankruptcy will affect the buying habits of worldcom in the future 
we believe that we have reduced operating expenses to a sufficient level such that when combined with our anticipated revenue  we will remain profitable 
in the event that we do not remain profitable  we may be required to further reduce our cost structure 
failure to sustain revenue and remain profitable coupled with our significant accumulated deficit could also result in our inability to continue as a going concern 
because our operating expenses include substantial fixed costs  we may not achieve future profitability if our expected revenue levels are not achieved 
the level of our operating expenses  which include a substantial fixed component in the form of compensation  employee related costs  occupancy costs and other costs incurred under contractual arrangements  is based  in part  on our expectation of future revenue 
these expenses cannot be reduced quickly 
if revenue levels are below expectations  operating results are likely to be materially and adversely affected because we may not be able to reduce operating expenses in sufficient time to compensate for the reduction in revenue 
substantial dilution to our common stockholders could result if we are required to raise additional capital through the sale of equity at less than per share 
in connection with our march financing  investors purchased debentures for million that will initially convert into  shares of our common stock at the rate of per share plus warrants to purchase  exercisable for per share 
in connection with this financing  the investors received full ratchet anti dilution price protection on the conversion of their debentures and upon exercise of their warrants 
this means that if we are required to issue additional shares of common stock in connection with a financing or under other circumstances at a price lower than per share  the debentures would become convertible into a greater number of shares of common stock than they are today  or if we issue additional shares at less than per share  the warrants would become exercisable at a lower price and for an additional number of shares 
issuances of common stock that do not trigger this anti dilution protection include issuances as part of an acquisition or strategic investment  issuances under our stock incentive plan or employee stock purchase plan  issuances or issuances as part of a public offering of more than million 
the following table shows the number of shares that the currently outstanding debentures would be convertible into and the warrants would be exercisable for if we were to issue additional shares of common stock at prices  and below  the price that the investors originally paid for the debentures 
debenture warrant of company decline issuance price shares shares total no anti dilution   we are highly dependent on sales to telecommunications companies  and the loss of at t  worldcom or sprint as customers could severely harm our business 
our primary sales and marketing strategy depends predominantly on sales to telecommunications service providers 
we expect that a significant portion of our revenue in will be attributable to sales of visual uptime and visual ip insight to service providers 
the loss of any one of at t  worldcom or sprint  which together have historically provided a majority of our revenue  would result in a substantial loss of revenue that could have a material adverse effect on our business 
for the year ended december   at t  worldcom and sprint accounted for  and  respectively  of our consolidated revenue 
revenue related to our shipment of products to service providers represented  and of our consolidated revenue for the years ended december    and  respectively 
this concentration should continue because our customer base consists predominantly of service providers 
existing service provider customers are not easily replaced because of the relatively few participants in that market 
high barriers to entry due to extraordinary capital requirements and the increased possibility that existing service providers may merge or fail because of the current downturn in the telecommunications industry  may further reduce their number and make replacing a significant network service provider customer very difficult in the future 
furthermore  the small number of network service providers means that the reduction  delay or cancellation of orders or a delay in shipment of our products to any one service provider customer could have a material adverse effect on our revenue for a quarter 
worldcom  one of our largest customers  declared bankruptcy during and there is no guarantee that it will be able to emerge from bankruptcy protection or that we will continue to achieve significant levels of revenue from worldcom in the future 
we are uncertain as to whether bankruptcy will affect the buying habits of worldcom in the future 
our anticipated dependence on sizable orders from a limited number of service provider customers will make the relationship between us and each service provider critically important to our business 
further  because none of our agreements contain minimum purchase requirements  there can be no assurance that the issuance of a purchase order will result in significant recurring business 
an unanticipated interruption or delay in the scheduled receipt of products from our subcontract manufacturers could reduce revenue 
we have outsourced the manufacture of our ase units  the analysis service element of our visual uptime system  to two subcontract manufacturing firms 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenue from the sale of these units 
our ability to meet the delivery dates requested by customers depends on the timely supply of products from the subcontract manufacturers 
a decision by a subcontract manufacturer to reduce or eliminate the amount of credit extended to us or to stop the shipment of products due to concerns about our financial condition or the amount of their credit and inventory risk could delay delivery of product to our customers and cause a delay in our revenue 
if we are required to establish alternative subcontract manufacturers  there can be no assurances that we would be able to do so  or to do so on terms acceptable to us 
furthermore  if we were required to replace our current contract manufacturers  we could face substantial production delays and could be required to pay substantially higher prices in order to complete delivery of our customers orders 
such a delay or price increase could substantially damage our ability to generate sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
our failure to comply with nasdaq s listing standards could result in our delisting by nasdaq from the nasdaq small cap market and severely limit the ability of investors to sell our common stock 
in  we moved the trading of our common stock to the nasdaq small cap market 
to maintain the listing on this market  we are required to meet certain requirements  including a minimum bid price of per share 
if our stock is traded below the minimum bid price for consecutive business days  we will receive a deficiency notice and will have a grace period of calendar days to cure the deficiency by meeting the minimum bid price per share trading price for ten consecutive days 
there can be no assurance that we will maintain compliance with the minimum bid price 
if we fail to meet the minimum bid price for consecutive days during the grace period our common stock may be delisted from the nasdaq small cap market 
even if we are able to comply with the minimum bid price requirement  there is no assurance that in the future we will continue to satisfy the other nasdaq listing requirements  with the result that our common stock may be delisted 
should our common stock be delisted from the nasdaq small cap market  it would likely be traded on the so called pink sheets or the electronic bulletin board maintained by the national association of securities dealers  inc consequently  it would likely be more difficult to trade in or obtain accurate quotations as to the market price of our common stock 
furthermore  if we are no longer listed on the nasdaq small cap market  our outstanding debentures may be accelerated and become immediately due and payable upon demand by the debenture holders 
various events could trigger early repayment of our debentures and we may not have enough cash to repay our debenture holders 
under the terms of the million of convertible debentures that we sold in march  a number of events could trigger the debenture holders right to force early repayment of of the outstanding principal plus accrued and unpaid interest owed under the debentures 
events constituting a triggering event include o our default on other indebtedness or obligations under any other debenture  any mortgage  credit agreement or other facility  indenture agreement  factoring agreement or other instrument under which there may be issued  or by which there may be secured or evidenced  any indebtedness for borrowed money or money due under any long term leasing or factoring arrangement in an amount exceeding million  o failure to have our common stock listed on an eligible market  o our bankruptcy  o engaging in certain change in control  sale of assets or redemption transactions  o failure to timely file our annual report  and o certain other failures to perform our obligations under the debenture agreement and or the related agreements 
in addition to the above  if our earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  less capital expenditures  for the fiscal year ended december  is less than million  our debenture holders may require that we prepay all or a portion of up to of the outstanding principal amount of their debentures 
if we do not have sufficient cash to repay these amounts early  we may be required to seek additional capital through a sale of assets  sale of additional securities or through additional borrowings  none of which may be available on terms reasonably acceptable to us 
the downturn in the telecommunications market may make it more difficult for us to generate sufficient revenue from our service provider customers incorporating our products into their infrastructure 
aspects of our service provider deployment strategy depend on the sale of visual uptime and visual ip insight to service providers for use as operations tools in their own network infrastructures 
however  capital expenditures by service providers have decreased as they attempt to recover from the ongoing decline in the telecommunications markets 
this decrease may directly affect a service provider s purchases of our products for such purposes 
pressure on capital expenditures in and the decline of the telecommunications industry may delay the roll out of new services based on our products offered by our service provider customers 
any potential reduction in demand for value added services or products  which our products support  from the service providers customers  directly impacts the purchase volume of our products and may impact our ability to sustain revenue 
the success of this strategy in will depend  in part  on our ability to demonstrate that our product solutions reduce service provider operating expenses and enable the creation of new revenue generating services 
we cannot be sure that we will be successful in demonstrating the value of our products to service providers 
if we are unsuccessful  our revenue could be significantly lower than anticipated 
our long sales cycle  which has had a median length of approximately five to six months  requires us to expend significant resources on potential sales opportunities that may never be consummated 
sales of visual uptime and visual ip insight can involve significant capital outlays by our customers and significant testing and education 
because of the delays inherent in large organizations making significant capital expenditures on complicated systems  our sales cycles are relatively long 
for enterprise customers  our historical sales cycle has ranged from approximately one to twelve months  with a median of approximately five to six months 
this extended cycle further increases the risk that a potential customer might suffer a reduction in their capital budgets or a change in their need for our products 
because we are required to commit substantial sales and marketing resources during this extended time period without any assurance of consummating an eventual sale  we risk incurring significant losses without generating any revenue 
improvements to the infrastructure of the internet could reduce or eliminate demand for our network performance management products 
the demand for our network performance management products could be reduced or eliminated if future improvements to the infrastructure of the internet lead companies to conclude that measuring and evaluating the performance of their networks is no longer important to their business 
the internet is a complex  heterogeneous network of communications networks with multiple operators and vendors supplying and managing the underlying infrastructure as well as connections to this infrastructure 
because the inherent complexity of the internet currently causes significant e commerce quality of service problems for companies  the vendors and operators that supply and manage the underlying infrastructure are continuously seeking to improve the speed  availability  reliability and consistency of the internet 
if these vendors and operators succeed in significantly improving the performance of the internet  which would result in corresponding improvements in the performance of companies networks  demand for our products  and thus our revenue  would likely decline 
failure to adapt to rapid technological change could adversely affect our ability to compete effectively 
the market for our products is characterized by rapid changes  including continuing advances in technology  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and preferences and changes in industry standards 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new products and product enhancements in a timely fashion that accommodate future changes  we will likely lose customers and business which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the introduction of new technologies or advances in techniques for network services or the integration of service level management functionality into other network hardware components could render our products obsolete or unmarketable 
there can be no assurance that i our existing products will continue to compete successfully  ii our future product offerings will keep pace with the technological changes implemented by our competitors  iii our products will satisfy evolving industry standards or preferences of existing or prospective customers  or iv we will be successful in developing and marketing products for any future technology 
we face growing competition from several market segments that could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers 
we face competition from several market segments whose functionality our products integrate 
we expect competition in each of these market segments to intensify in the future 
our current competitors  include  and in the future may include  the following brix  kentrox  paradyne  adtran  packeteer  netscout  lucent technologies and concord 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services that they offer 
while we intend to compete by offering superior features  performance  reliability and flexibility at competitive prices and on the strength of our relationships with service providers  many of these competitors have greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us  and some have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
as a result  these competitors may be able to respond to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements more effectively than us  or devote greater resources than us to the development  promotion and sale of products 
in addition  we believe that competitors from one or more of our market segments could partner with each other to offer products that supply functionality approaching that provided by visual uptime 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced profitability and loss of market share  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
errors in our products or services could discourage customers and damage our reputation 
products and services as complex as those we offer may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
there can be no assurance that  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors will not be found in new products and services until commercial shipments have commenced 
such errors can substantially delay the time until we are able to generate revenue from new product releases and could force us to divert additional development resources to correct the errors 
if such errors are detected after shipments have been made  then our reputation may be damaged  and we may incur substantial costs covering warranty claims 
in our research and development spending plan  we allocate twenty percent of the engineering budget for sustaining issues 
sustaining issues include fixing problems in released products that were not identified in the development and testing cycle 
if during a given period  problems are found that cause the allocation of more than twenty percent of our resources to fixing these problems  then the next round of product feature releases can be delayed by this diversion of resources 
in the case of visual ip insight  in  we encountered difficulties in the implementation of the product in certain customer environments that resulted in expending greater than twenty percent of the budget for that product for sustaining engineering 
this resulted in delays in new visual ip insight feature development 
our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers makes the price we pay for important components in our products more volatile 
many key components used in the manufacture of our products are purchased only from sole or limited sources 
we presently use sole source suppliers for many of the components in our products  including dallas semiconductor for framers  lucent for fpgas  motorola for embedded communications processors  mindspeed for communication controllers and level one for line interface components 
although these components represent less than one percent of the contents of our products  if a sole or limited source supplier raises their prices  delays shipments or becomes unable or unwilling to supply a key component  we may be forced to obtain these components from alternative sources if they are available  which could impair our ability to deliver our products to our customers in a timely and cost effective manner  or could force us to increase our prices or reduce our gross profit margins 
claims by others that we infringe their intellectual property rights may harm our business 
if others claim that our products infringe on their intellectual property rights  whether the claims are valid or not  we may be forced to spend significant sums in litigation  pay damages  delay product shipments  reengineer our products or acquire licenses to the claimant s intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or to obtain licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
we expect that these claims may become more common as the number of products in the network management industry increases and the functionality of these products further overlaps 
if a claimant is successful in a lawsuit arising from such a claim  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
adverse publicity related to any intellectual property litigation also could harm the sale of our products and damage our competitive position 
failure to protect our own intellectual property rights may harm our business 
our success is dependent on the competitive advantage we gain from our proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
if we are unable to adequately protect our intellectual property  including our patented technology  others may be able to more easily compete by developing functionally equivalent technology 
we currently hold five united states patents  and also rely on copyright and trade secret laws  trademarks  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary software  documentation and other proprietary information 
these protection methods may not be adequate to prevent competitors from developing similar technology 
litigation to enforce our intellectual property rights  regardless of its success or failure  could be burdensome and expensive and could involve a high degree of uncertainty 
in addition  legal proceedings may divert management s attention from growing our business 
we may be subject to additional risk as we enter into transactions in countries where intellectual property laws are not well developed or enforced effectively 
legal protection of our rights may be ineffective in such countries  and technology developed or used in such countries may not be protected in jurisdictions where protection is ordinarily available 
the loss of key people could jeopardize our growth prospects 
the loss of the services of peter minihane  our interim president and chief executive officer  without an organized succession plan  patrick clark  our executive vice president for global sales  steven hindman  our executive vice president for product management and marketing  wayne fuller  our executive vice president for product operations  or any other key employee could adversely affect our ability to execute our business plan and could have a material adverse effect on our short and long term revenue 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of our key management and technical employees  particularly messrs 
minihane  clark  hindman and fuller 
if we are unable to recruit and retain employees  particularly a permanent president and ceo and cfo  we may be unable to grow to meet increased sales 
we are currently engaged in searches for a permanent president and chief executive officer and a chief financial officer 
due to the various risk factors described herein  we may find it very difficult or be unable to find qualified candidates for these positions at all  or on terms suitable to us 
additionally  although we have recently reduced our operating costs  including personnel  our future depends on increasing sales which will eventually require hiring and retaining additional highly skilled managerial  sales  marketing  customer support and product development personnel 
intense competition for technically trained sales and product development personnel makes recruiting and keeping qualified personnel difficult 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in continuing to attract and retain skilled employees 
failure to do so could hamper our ability to grow and meet future customer orders 
we may face difficulties assimilating and may incur costs associated with any future acquisitions 
although we have no current acquisition plans  we may seek to acquire or invest in businesses  products or technologies that we feel could complement or expand our business  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
in the past we have suffered substantial difficulties in assimilating companies that we have acquired  particularly with respect to our acquisition of avesta 
our failure to successfully assimilate companies or technologies acquired by us or the occurrence of unanticipated costs that may arise in connection with such acquisitions could have a material adverse effect on our business 
by example  problems with assimilating avesta and its technology contributed to a substantial diversion of our personnel and financial resources and eventually resulted in our write off of many of the avesta assets  including intangible assets and the discontinuation of the avesta products  that we were unable to integrate into our service line 
we have anti takeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 
terms of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws make it more difficult for another individual or company to acquire control of our company  even if a change of control would benefit our stockholders 
these terms include o our board of directors  without stockholder approval  may issue up to  shares of preferred stock on terms that they determine 
this preferred stock could be issued quickly with terms that delay or prevent the change in control of our company  make removal of management more difficult or depress the price of our stock  o certain provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws and of delaware law could delay or make more difficult a merger  tender offer or proxy contest  o we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law which prohibits a publicly held delaware corporation from engaging in a business combination with an interested stockholder for a period of three years after the date of the transaction in which the person became an interested stockholder  unless the business combination is approved in a prescribed manner  o our board of directors is staggered so that only a portion of its members are elected each year  o only our board of directors  our chairman of the board  our president or stockholders holding a majority of our stock can call special stockholder meetings  and o special procedures must be followed in order for stockholders to present proposals at stockholder meetings 
in addition  the million of debentures that we issued in march may become immediately due and payable upon a change of control  which could have the effect of discouraging an acquisition that might otherwise benefit our stockholders 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk during  we issued long term debt in the form of the convertible debentures discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the convertible debentures bear interest at a fixed annual rate of 
we are also exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates 
our investment policy restricts us to investing only in investment grade securities 
a failure of these investment securities to perform at their historical levels could reduce the interest income realized by us 
as of december   the fair value of our long term debt did not differ materially from its carrying value 
while substantially all of our product sales to date have been made to customers in the united states  we plan to sell our products to foreign customers at prices denominated in us dollars 
however  if we commence selling material volumes of product to such customers at prices not denominated in us dollars  we intend to adopt a strategy to hedge against fluctuations in foreign currency
