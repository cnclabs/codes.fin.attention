except where specifically indicated  the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations does not include the anticipated effects of the proposed transactions described under item business recent developments 
overview as of december   the company owned interests in retail properties containing an aggregate of approximately million square feet  multifamily properties containing  units and four industrial properties with an aggregate of approximately million square feet 
the company also owns interests in two retail properties currently under development  which are expected to contain an aggregate of approximately million square feet upon completion 
the company also provides management  leasing and development services for affiliated and third party property owners with respect to retail properties containing approximately million square feet  six office buildings containing approximately million square feet and two multifamily properties with units 
the company has achieved significant growth since with the acquisition of the rubin organization tro and the formation of pri 
during  the company continued this trend with two retail properties in its development pipeline  and same store net operating income growth of and in the retail and multifamily sectors  respectively 
please refer to item business recent developments and note to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of certain currently proposed transactions and other significant events related to our growth strategy 
if the proposed transactions are consummated  management  anticipates that it will need to devote significant resources to integrating the properties to be acquired into the company s existing retail portfolio 
this integration process could impact the company s day to day business 
the company s net income increased by million to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  real estate properties sold in generated gains of million as compared to million for the properties sold in property acquisitions and the placement in service in of properties previously under development resulted in an increase in company real estate revenues  with a corresponding increase in property operating expenses  and depreciation  amortization and interest expenses 
the company has investments in unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures the joint ventures 
the purpose of the joint ventures is to own and operate real estate 
it is a common practice in the real estate industry to invest in real estate in this manner 
of the joint venture properties  the company managed four of the properties and other parties  including several of the company s joint venture partners  manage the remaining properties 
none of the company s joint venture partners are affiliates of the company 
one of the company s key strategic objectives is to obtain managerial control of all its assets  although the company cannot assure you that it will do so 
the company holds a non controlling interest in each joint venture  and accounts for the joint ventures using the equity method of accounting 
under this accounting method  the company does not consolidate the joint ventures 
instead  the company records the earnings from the joint ventures under the income statement caption entitled equity in income of partnerships and joint ventures 
changes in the company s investment in these entities are recorded in the balance sheet caption entitled investment in and advances to partnerships and joint ventures  at equity 
for further information regarding the company s joint ventures  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management has made estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has utilized available information including the company s past history  industry standards and the current economic environment  among other factors  in forming its estimates and judgments  giving due consideration to materiality 
actual results may differ from those estimates 
in addition  other companies may utilize different estimates  which may impact comparability of the company s results of operations to those of companies in similar businesses 
set forth below is a summary of the accounting policies that management believes are critical to the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
this summary should be read in conjunction with the more complete discussion of the company s accounting policies included in note to the consolidated financial statements of the company 
revenue recognition the company derives over of its revenues from tenant rents and other tenant related activities 
tenant rents include base rents  percentage rents  expense reimbursements such as common area maintenance  real estate taxes and utilities and straight line rents 
the company records base rents on a straight line basis  which means that the monthly base rent income according to the terms of the company s leases with its tenants is adjusted so that an average monthly rent is recorded for each tenant over the term of its lease 
the difference between base rent and straight line rent is a non cash increase or decrease to rental income 
the straight line rent adjustment increased revenue by approximately million in  million in and million in percentage rents represent rental income that the tenant pays based on a percentage of its sales 
tenants that pay percentage rent usually pay in one of two ways  either a percentage of their total sales or a percentage of sales over a certain threshold 
in the latter case  the company does not record percentage rent until the sales threshold has been reached 
certain lease agreements contain provisions that require tenants to reimburse a pro rata share of real estate taxes and certain common area maintenance costs 
deferred revenue represents rental revenue received from tenants prior to their due dates 
expense reimbursement payments generally are made monthly based on a budgeted amount determined at the beginning of the year 
during the year  the company s income increases or decreases based on actual expense levels and changes in other factors that influence the reimbursement amounts  such as occupancy levels 
in  the company accrued million of income because reimbursable expense levels were greater than amounts billed 
shortly after the end of the year  the company prepares a reconciliation of the actual amounts due from tenants 
the difference between the actual amount due and the amounts paid by the tenant throughout the year is billed or credited to the tenant  depending on whether the tenant paid too much or too little during the year 
termination fee income is recognized in the period when a termination agreement is signed 
in the event that a tenant is in bankruptcy when the termination agreement is signed  termination fee income is recognized when it is received 
the company s other significant source of revenues comes from management activities  including property management  leasing and development 
management fees generally are a percentage of managed property revenues or cash receipts 
leasing fees are earned upon the consummation of new leases 
development fees are earned over the time period of the development activity 
these activities collectively are referred to as management fees in the consolidated statement of income 
there are no significant cash versus accrual differences for these activities 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable the company makes estimates of the collectibility of its accounts receivables related to tenant rents including base rents  straight line rentals  expense reimbursements and other revenue or income 
the company specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
in addition  with respect to tenants in bankruptcy  the company makes estimates of the expected recovery of pre petition and post petition claims in assessing the estimated collectibility of the related receivable 
in some cases  the time required to reach an ultimate resolution of these claims can exceed one year 
these estimates have a direct impact on the company s net income because a higher bad debt reserve results in less net income 
real estate land  buildings and fixtures and tenant improvements are recorded at cost and stated at cost less accumulated depreciation 
expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred 
renovations and or replacements  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives 
properties are depreciated using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the estimated useful lives are as follows buildings years land improvements years furniture fixtures years tenant improvements lease term the company is required to make subjective assessments as to the useful life of its properties for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect to those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on the company s net income 
if the company were to lengthen the expected useful life of a particular asset  it would be depreciated over more years  and result in less depreciation expense and higher annual net income 
assessment by the company of certain other lease related costs must be made when the company has a reason to believe that the tenant may not be able to perform under the terms of the lease as originally expected 
this requires management to make estimates as to the recoverability of such assets 
gains from sales of real estate properties generally are recognized using the full accrual method in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for real estate sales  provided that various criteria are met relating to the terms of sale and any subsequent involvement by the company with the properties sold 
off balance sheet arrangements the company has a number of off balance sheet joint ventures and other unconsolidated arrangements with varying structures described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
all of these arrangements are accounted for under the equity method because the company has the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control over the operating and financial decisions of the joint ventures 
accordingly  the company s share of the earnings of these joint ventures and companies is reflected in consolidated net income based upon the company s estimated economic ownership percentage 
to the extent that the company contributes assets to a joint venture  the company s investment in the joint venture is recorded at the company s cost basis in the assets that were contributed to the joint venture 
to the extent that the company s cost basis is different than the basis reflected at the joint venture level  the basis difference is amortized over the life of the related asset and reflected in the company s share of equity in net income of joint ventures 
assets held for sale the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets effective january  this standard addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when assets are identified by management as held for sale  the company discontinues depreciating the assets and estimates the sales price  net of selling costs of such assets 
if  in management s opinion  the net sales price of the assets that have been identified for sale is less than the net book value of the assets  a valuation allowance is established 
the company generally considers assets to be held for sale when the transaction has been approved by the appropriate level of management and there are no known material contingencies relating to the sale such that the sale is probable within one year 
accordingly  the results of operations of operating properties disposed of or classified as held for sale subsequent to january  for which the company has no significant continuing involvement  are reflected as discontinued operations 
asset impairment on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are any indicators that the value of the real estate properties may be impaired 
a property s value is impaired only if management s estimate of the aggregate future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges to be generated by the property are less than the carrying value of the property 
these estimates consider factors such as expected future operating income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand  competition and other factors 
in addition  these estimates may consider a probability weighted cash flow estimation approach when alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of a long lived asset are under consideration or when a range is estimated 
the determination of undiscounted cash flows requires significant estimates by management and considers the expected course of action at the balance sheet date 
subsequent changes in estimated undiscounted cash flows arising from changes in anticipated action could impact the determination of whether an impairment exists and whether the effects could materially impact the company s net income 
to the extent impairment has occurred  the loss will be measured as the excess of the carrying amount of the property over the fair value of the property 
the company conducts an annual review of goodwill balances for impairment and to determine whether any adjustments to the carrying value of goodwill are recognized 
liquidity and capital resources equity offering on july   the company issued  through a public offering  million shares of beneficial interest at a price of per share the offering 
net proceeds from the offering after deducting the underwriting discount of million and other expenses of approximately million were approximately million 
proceeds from the offering were used to repay million outstanding on an existing construction loan and million of outstanding indebtedness under the company s credit facility 
the remaining proceeds were used to fund projects then under development 
credit facility the company s operating partnership has a million revolving credit facility the credit facility with a group of banks 
the obligations of the company s operating partnership under the credit facility are secured by a pool of properties and have been guaranteed by the company 
there was million outstanding under the credit facility at december  the credit facility expires in december the initial term of the credit facility may be extended for an additional year on the lender s approval 
the company has not yet determined if it will seek to extend the existing credit facility or if it will seek another financing alternative 
the credit facility bears interest at the london interbank offered rate libor plus margins ranging from to basis points  depending on the ratio of the company s consolidated liabilities to gross asset value the leverage ratio  each as determined pursuant to the terms of the credit facility 
as of december   the margin was set at basis points 
the credit facility contains affirmative and negative covenants customarily found in facilities of this type  as well as requirements that the company maintain  on a consolidated basis a maximum leverage ratio of  a maximum borrowing base value as defined in the credit facility of  a minimum weighted average collateral pool property occupancy of  minimum tangible net worth as defined in the credit facility of million plus of cumulative net proceeds from the sale of equity securities  minimum ratios of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  and amortization ebitda to debt service and interest expense as defined in the credit facility of and  respectively  at december   maximum floating rate debt of million  and maximum commitments for properties under development not in excess of of gross asset value as defined in the credit facility 
as of december   the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 
capital resources the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements generally through its available working capital and net cash provided by operations 
the company believes that its net cash provided by operations will be sufficient to allow the company to make any distributions necessary to enable the company to continue to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  as amended 
the company also believes that the foregoing sources of liquidity will be sufficient to fund its short term liquidity needs for the foreseeable future  including capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
the following are some of the risks that could impact the company s cash flows and require the funding of future distributions  capital expenditures  tenant improvements and or leasing commissions with sources other than operating cash flows o increase in tenant bankruptcies reducing revenue and operating cash flows  o increase in interest expenses as a result of borrowing incurred in order to finance long term capital requirements such as property and portfolio acquisitions  o increase in interest rates affecting the company s net cost of borrowing  o increase in insurance premiums and or the company s portion of claims  o eroding market conditions in one or more of the company s primary geographic regions adversely affecting property operating cash flows  and o disputes with tenants over common area maintenance and other charges 
the company expects to meet certain long term capital requirements such as property and portfolio acquisitions  scheduled debt maturities  renovations  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities 
the company also expects to increase the funds available under the credit facility by placing acquired or developed properties into the collateral pool upon the achievement of prescribed criteria so as to fund acquisitions  development activities and capital improvements 
in general  when the credit markets are tight  the company may encounter resistance from lenders when the company seeks financing or refinancing for properties or proposed acquisitions 
the company also may be unable to sell additional equity securities on terms that are favorable to the company  if at all 
additionally  the following are some of the potential impediments to accessing additional funds under the credit facility o reduction in occupancy at one or more properties in the collateral pool  o reduction in appraised value of one or more properties in the collateral pool  o reduction in net operating income at one or more properties in the collateral pool  o constraining leverage covenants under the credit facility  o increased interest rates affecting interest coverage ratios  and o reduction in the company s consolidated earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
at december  the company had outstanding borrowings of million under its credit facility and had pledged million under the credit facility as collateral for several letters of credit 
of the unused portion of the credit facility of approximately million  as of december   the company s loan covenant restrictions allowed the company to borrow approximately an additional million based on the existing property collateral pool 
as noted  one of the additional means of increasing the company s borrowing capacity under the credit facility is the addition of unencumbered acquisition and or development properties to the collateral pool 
for example  during the first quarter of  the company placed creekview shopping center  a recently completed retail development project  into the collateral pool  which increased the company s borrowing capacity by approximately million 
the company expects to place additional projects into the collateral pool to provide additional borrowing capacity  as necessary 
the company believes that the anticipated placement of properties into the collateral pool will allow for sufficient availability of borrowing capacity to fund the development pipeline and acquisition commitments  other than with respect to the proposed rouse transactions  as well as any short term liquidity needs that are not fulfilled by cash flows from operations 
proposed transactions the company currently expects to incur approximately million of new and assumed indebtedness in order to complete the rouse transactions described under item business recent developments 
the company currently expects to use the proceeds from an acquisition term loan to finance the purchase of the rouse malls  and is in discussions with several institutional lenders regarding the loan 
the company will need to obtain the consent of the lenders under the credit facility to incur indebtedness under the acquisition term loan and to waive the effect of the proposed rouse transactions under the debt covenants of the credit facility 
this consent is not a condition to closing the rouse transactions  so the company may be required to terminate the rouse transactions and forfeit its million deposit to rouse if the company is unable to secure the acquisition term loan or obtain the consent of its lenders 
if the acquisition term loan and consent of the company s lenders is secured  and if the rouse transactions are consummated  the company will have a higher debt level and interest expense 
the company expects to reduce indebtedness by repayment or assumption by morgan of approximately million of indebtedness in connection with the sale of its multifamily portfolio to morgan described under item business recent developments 
in addition  the company expects to substantially repay the acquisition term loan that it expects to obtain in connection with the rouse transactions primarily with the cash proceeds from the sale of the multifamily portfolio  which is not expected to close until after the rouse transaction closes 
the company expects to finance the remainder of the rouse transaction with additional fixed rate  non recourse debt secured by assets acquired from rouse on an unencumbered basis 
if the sale of the multifamily portfolio to morgan does not occur  then the company may attempt to repay the term loan with the proceeds of a later sale of some or all of the multifamily portfolio  a sale of equity or other securities or otherwise 
the company cannot assure you that such proceeds will be available on terms that are favorable to the company  if at all 
a substantial portion of the expected gain from the sale of our multifamily portfolio to morgan has been designed under section of the internal revenue code to meet the requirements for a tax deferred exchange 
if the company sells its multifamily portfolio without a corresponding purchase from rouse or another party  then the company will incur substantial tax liability  including an obligation to indemnify the former owners of one of the properties included in the multifamily portfolio against the tax consequences of the sale

funds from operations funds from operations ffo is an important and widely used financial measure of the operating performance of real estate companies and is provided here as a supplemental measure of operating performance 
ffo is not specifically defined by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
given the nature of our business as a real estate company  we believe that ffo is helpful to investors as a measure of operational performance because it excludes various items included in net income that do not relate to or are not indicative of our operating performance such as various non recurring items  gains and losses on sales of real estate and related depreciation and amortization  which can make periodic and peer analyses of operating performance more difficult to conduct 
ffo is defined as income before gains losses on property sales and extraordinary items computed in accordance with gaap plus real estate depreciation and similar adjustments for unconsolidated joint ventures after adjustments for non real estate depreciation and amortization of financing costs 
the company computes ffo in accordance with standards established by nareit  which may not be comparable to ffo reported by other reits that do not define the term in accordance with the current nareit definition  or that interpret the current nareit definition differently than the company 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of the company s financial performance or as an alternative to cash flow from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund the company s cash needs  including its ability to make cash distributions 
ffo increased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million in the increase was primarily due to completed development projects  the acquisition of a interest in willow grove park  the acquisition of beaver valley mall  and internal growth in the company s retail portfolio 
the following information is provided to reconcile net income  which we believe is the most directly comparable gaap number  to ffo  and to show the items included in our ffo for the past periods indicated in thousands  except per share data rounded for the year ended december  per share per share net income   minority interest in operating partnership   minority interest in discontinued operations gains on sales of interests in real estate  gains on dispositions of discontinued operations  depreciation and amortization wholly owned consolidated partnership   unconsolidated partnerships joint ventures   discontinued operations excess purchase price over net assets acquired prepayment fee funds from operations   weighted average number of shares outstanding   weighted average effect of full conversion of op units   total weighted average shares outstanding  including op units   excludes depreciation of non real estate assets  amortization of deferred financing costs and discontinued operations

competition the company s shopping centers compete with other shopping centers in their trade areas as well as alternative retail formats  including catalogues  home shopping networks and internet commerce 
apartment properties compete for tenants with other multifamily properties as well as single family housing alternatives in their markets 
economic factors  such as employment trends and the level of interest rates  impact shopping center sales as well as a prospective tenant s choice to rent or own his her residence 
some of our properties are of the same type and are within the same market area as other competitive properties 
this results in the competition for both acquisition of prime sites and for tenants to occupy the space that we and our competitors develop and manage 
the existence of competitive properties could have a material adverse effect on our ability to lease space and on the level of rents we can obtain 
seasonality shopping center leases often provide for the payment of rents based on a percentage of sales over certain levels 
income from such rents is recorded only after the minimum sales levels have been met 
the sales levels are often met in the fourth quarter  during the december holiday season 
inflation inflation can have many effects on the financial performance of the company 
shopping center leases often provide for the payment of rents based on a percentage of sales  which may increase with inflation 
leases may also provide for tenants to bear all or a portion of operating expenses  which may reduce the impact of such increases on the company 
apartment leases are normally for a one year term  which may allow the company to seek increased rents as leases are renewed or when new tenants are obtained 
however  during times when inflation is greater than increases in rent as provided for in leases  net increases may not keep up with inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the analysis below presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market interest rates 
in order to mitigate the impact of fluctuation in market interest rates  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements with notional amounts totaling million 
all derivative instruments are entered into for other than trading purposes 
as of december   the company s consolidated debt portfolio consisted of million in fixed rate mortgage notes and million borrowed under its revolving facility  which has a variable interest rate 
changes in market interest rates have different impacts on the fixed and variable portions of the company s debt portfolio 
a change in market interest rates on the fixed portion of the debt portfolio impacts the fair value  but it has no impact on interest incurred or cash flows 
a change in market interest rates on the variable portion of the debt portfolio impacts the interest incurred and cash flows  but does not impact the fair value 
the sensitivity analysis related to the fixed debt portfolio assumes an immediate basis point move in interest rates from their actual december  levels  with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a decrease in the net financial instrument position of million at december  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in an increase in the net financial instrument position of million at december  based on the variable rate debt included in the company s debt portfolio  including two interest rate swap agreements  as of december   a basis point increase in interest rates would have resulted in an additional million in interest incurred in a basis point decrease would have reduced interest incurred by million in to manage interest rate risk  the company may employ options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying exposure 
the company undertakes a variety of borrowings from lines of credit  to medium and long term financings 
to limit overall interest cost  the company may use interest rate instruments  typically interest rate swaps  to convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt  or even a portion of its fixed rate debt to variable rate debt 
interest rate differentials that arise under these swap contracts are recognized in interest expense over the life of the contracts 
the resulting cost of funds is expected to be lower than that which would have been available if debt with matching characteristics was issued directly 
the company may also employ forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying anticipated transactions 
gains and losses are deferred and recognized in net income in the same period that the underlying transaction occurs  expires or is otherwise terminated 
mortgage notes payable  which are secured by of the company s wholly owned properties  are due in installments over various terms extending to the year with interest at rates ranging from to with a weighted average interest rate of at december  the following table summarizes the notional values and fair values of the company s derivative financial instruments at december  the notional value provides an indication of the extent of the company s involvement in these instruments at that time  but does not represent exposure to credit  interest rate or market risks 
fixed interest rate notional amount vs 
day libor maturity date million december million december as of december   the derivative instruments were reported at their fair value as a liability of million 
this amount is included in accrued expenses and other liabilities on the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
interest rate hedges that are designated as cash flow hedges hedge the future cash outflows on debt 
interest rate swaps that convert variable payments to fixed payments  interest rate caps  floors  collars and forwards are cash flow hedges 
the unrealized gains losses in the fair value of these hedges are reported on the consolidated balance sheet with a corresponding adjustment to either accumulated other comprehensive income or earnings depending on the type of hedging relationship 
if the hedging transaction is a cash flow hedge  then the offsetting gains losses are reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
over time  the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income loss will be charged to earnings 
this treatment matches the adjustment recorded when the hedged items are also recognized in earnings 
within the next twelve months  the company expects to incur interest expense of approximately million of the current balance held in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
disclosure of limitations as the information presented above includes only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
the information represented herein has limited predictive value 
as a result  the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  the hedging strategies at the time and interest rates
