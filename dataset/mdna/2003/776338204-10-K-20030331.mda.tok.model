critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america which requires that certain estimates and assumptions be made that affect the amounts and disclosures reported in those financial statements and the related accompanying notes 
actual results could differ from these estimates and assumptions 
management uses its best judgment in valuing these estimates and may  as warranted  solicit external professional advice 
estimates are based on current facts and circumstances  prior experience and other assumptions believed to be reasonable 
the following critical accounting policies  some of which are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates  affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts the preparation of financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions relating to the collectibility of our accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounting for sales incentives the company records sales incentives as a reduction of sales in our statements of operations 
sales incentives include rebates  consideration and allowances given to retailers for space in their stores slotting fees  consideration and allowances given to obtain favorable display positions in the retailer s stores and other promotional activity 
the company records these promotional incentives in the period during which the related product is shipped to the customer  or when the expense is incurred 
estimated sales incentives are calculated and recorded at the time related sales are made and are based primarily on historical rates and consideration of recent promotional activities 
we review our assumptions and adjust our allowances quarterly 
our financial statements could be materially impacted if the actual promotion costs fluctuate from the standard rate 
the allowances are classified as a reduction of accounts receivable 
revenue recognition the company records revenue upon the shipment of its consumer products to customers and upon the delivery of the aviation products or services 
inventory valuations inventories are valued at lower of cost or market determined by the first in  first out fifo method 
management regularly reviews inventory for salability and establishes obsolescence reserves to absorb estimated lower market values 
on an annual basis  the company takes a physical inventory verifying the units on hand and comparing its perpetual records to physical counts 
impairment of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  the company assesses the recoverability of long lived assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the asset 
in the event the sum of the estimated undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying value of the asset  an impairment loss equal to the excess of the asset s carrying value over its fair value is recorded 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured for medical insurance up to certain maximum liability amounts 
medical insurance reserves are determined based upon historical expense experience  insurance company estimates and loss reporting trends 
the amounts accrued for self insurance are based upon management s best estimate and the amounts the company will ultimately disburse could differ from such accrued amounts 
other loss accruals the company has a number of other potential loss exposures incurred in the ordinary course of business such as environmental claims  product liability  litigation  restructuring charges  and appeal of a tax audit by the state of new jersey 
establishing accruals for these matters required management s estimate and judgment with regard to maximum risk exposure and ultimate liability or realization 
as a result  these estimates are often developed with the company s counsel  or other appropriate advisors  and are based on management s current understanding of the underlying facts and circumstances 
because of uncertainties related to the ultimate outcome of these issues or the possibility of changes in the underlying facts and circumstances  additional charges related to these issues could be required in the future 
pension plans the valuation of our pension plans requires the use of assumptions and estimates that are used to develop actuarial valuation of expenses  assets and liabilities 
these assumptions include discount rates  investment returns  and mortality rates 
the actuarial assumptions used in our pension reporting are reviewed annually by management and the company s independent actuary and compared with external benchmarks to ensure that they accurately account for our future pension obligations 
changes in assumptions and future investment returns could potentially have a material impact on pension expense and related funding requirements 
accounting for income taxes the company assesses the need for a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets by considering future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made
