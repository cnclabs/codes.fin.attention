item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading national distributor of natural and organic foods and related products in the united states 
in recent years  our sales to existing and new customers have increased through the acquisition of or merger with natural products distributors  the expansion of existing distribution centers and the continued growth of the natural products industry in general 
through these efforts  we believe that we have been able to broaden our geographic penetration  expand our customer base  enhance and diversify our product selections and increase our market share 
our distribution operations are comprised of three principal units our eastern region  which is comprised of united natural foods  united northeast formerly northeast cooperative and blooming prairie formerly blooming prairie cooperative  our western region  which is comprised of mountain people s warehouse  inc and rainbow natural foods  inc  and albert s  which operates in various markets across the united states 
through our subsidiary  the natural retail group  we also own and operate natural products retail stores located primarily in florida 
we believe our retail business serves as a natural complement to our distribution business  enabling us to develop new marketing programs and improve customer service 
in addition  hershey is a business that specializes in the international trading  roasting and packaging of nuts  seeds  dried fruits and snack items 
in order to maintain our market leadership and improve our operating efficiencies  we are continually expanding marketing and customer service programs across the four regions  expanding national purchasing opportunities  consolidating systems applications among physical locations and regions  integrating administrative and accounting functions  and reducing geographic overlap between regions 
in addition  our continued growth has created the need for expansion of existing facilities to achieve maximum operating efficiencies and to assure adequate space for future needs 
we have made considerable capital expenditures and incurred considerable expenses in connection with the expansion of our facilities  including the expansion of our facilities located in auburn  california  new oxford  pennsylvania  vernon  california  atlanta  georgia and our fontana  california distribution facility 
we completed the expansion of our chesterfield  new hampshire distribution facility in june this expansion included the consolidation of our operations from brattleboro  vermont to chesterfield  new hampshire 
we now operate a  square foot facility that provides more product diversity and enables us to better serve customers in our eastern region 
we are currently expanding our iowa city  iowa distribution facility from its existing  square feet to  square feet 
this will enable us to provide enhanced service levels to our customers in the midwest market and continue to grow our sales base in that market 
we are also currently expanding our dayville  connecticut distribution facility from its existing  square feet to  square feet 
the additional storage space in our iowa city and dayville facilities allows for more product diversity and the elimination of outside storage expenses 
while we anticipate incremental short term costs during the first half of fiscal  we expect the efficiencies created by expanding our iowa city and dayville facilities to lower our expenses relative to sales over the long term 
upon completion of the iowa city and dayville facilities expansions  we will have added approximately  square feet to our distribution centers in the last years  which represents a increase in our storage space 
while operating margins may be affected in periods in which these expenses are incurred  over the long term  we expect to benefit from the increased absorption of our expenses over a larger sales base 
in addition  we continue to increase our leading market share of the growing natural products industry by expanding our customer base  increasing our share of existing customers business and continuing to expand and further penetrate new distribution territories  particularly in the midwest and texas markets 
to this end  on october  we acquired substantially all the assets of blooming prairie  the largest volume distributor of natural foods and products in the midwest region of the united states 
the acquisition of blooming prairie s iowa city  iowa and mounds view  minnesota distribution facilities has provided us with an immediate physical base and growth platform with which to broaden our presence in the fast growing midwest market 
our net sales consist primarily of sales of natural products to retailers adjusted for customer volume discounts  returns and allowances 
the principal components of our cost of sales include the amount paid to manufacturers and growers for product sold  plus the cost of transportation necessary to bring the product to our distribution facilities 
operating expenses include salaries and wages  employee benefits including payments under our employee stock ownership plan  warehousing and delivery  selling  occupancy  insurance  administrative  depreciation and amortization expense 
other expenses income include interest on outstanding indebtedness  interest income  and the change in fair value of financial instruments and miscellaneous income and expenses 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined critical accounting policies as those that are both most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require our most difficult  complex or subjective judgments or estimates 
based on this definition  we believe our critical accounting policies include the following i determining our allowance for doubtful accounts and ii valuing goodwill and intangible assets 
for all financial statement periods presented  there have been no material modifications to the application of these critical accounting policies 
allowance for doubtful accounts we analyze customer creditworthiness  accounts receivable balances  payment history  payment terms and historical bad debt levels when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in instances where a reserve has been recorded for a particular customer  future sales to the customer are conducted using either cash on delivery terms  or the account is closely monitored so that as agreed upon payments are received  orders are released  a failure to pay results in held or cancelled orders 
our accounts receivable balance was million  net of the allowance for doubtful accounts of million  as of july  insurance reserves it is our policy to record the self insured portion of our workers compensation  health insurance and automobile liabilities based upon actuarial estimates of the future cost of claims and related expenses that have been reported but not settled  and that have been incurred but not yet reported 
any projection of losses concerning workers compensation and automobile liability is subject to a considerable degree of variability 
among the causes of this variability are unpredictable external factors affecting litigation trends  benefit level changes and claim settlement patterns 
if actual claims incurred are greater than those anticipated  our reserves may be insufficient and additional costs could be recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of goodwill and intangible assets sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets requires that companies no longer amortize goodwill  but instead test goodwill for impairment at least annually and between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
we have elected to perform our annual tests for indications of goodwill impairment as of july of each year 
impairment losses are determined based upon the excess of carrying amounts over discounted expected future cash flows of the underlying business 
the assessment of the recoverability of long lived assets will be impacted if estimated future cash flows are not achieved 
for reporting units that indicated potential impairment  we determined the implied fair value of that reporting unit using a discounted cash flow analysis and compared such values to the respective reporting units carrying amounts 
the restructuring of hershey during the fourth quarter of fiscal represented a triggering event that required us to evaluate hershey s goodwill for potential impairment 
our testing and subsequent analysis indicated that goodwill for hershey was impaired 
accordingly  we recognized an impairment charge of approximately million on goodwill for the year ended july  as of july   our annual assessment of each of our reporting units indicated that no impairment of goodwill existed 
we recorded additional goodwill in our distribution operating segment of approximately million during the year ended july  as a result of our acquisitions of blooming prairie cooperative warehouse million and northeast cooperative million 
total goodwill as of july  was million after recording the hershey impairment charge of approximately million 
as of july   we had goodwill of million 
goodwill for the distribution operating segment totaled million and million as of july  and  respectively 
results of operations the following table presents  for the periods indicated  certain income and expense items expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended july  gaap basis excluding special items net sales cost of sales gross profit operating expenses restructuring and asset impairment charges amortization of intangibles total operating expenses operating income other expense income interest expense change in value of financial instruments other  net total other expense income before income taxes income taxes net income year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales our net sales increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended july  from billion for the year ended july  the increase was primarily due to the effects of the acquired businesses  resulting in growth in the independently owned natural products retailers and mass market distribution channels of approximately and  respectively 
we acquired blooming prairie  a distributor of natural foods and products in the midwest region of the united states  in october  and northeast cooperative  another natural food distributor  in december the decline in the percentage of sales to supernaturals over the prior year was the result of the expiration of our contract as primary distributor to wild oats  inc wild oats in august however  we continued to distribute to wild oats in fiscal as a secondary supplier  and generated revenue from such distribution of approximately million 
fiscal sales growth including acquisitions  but excluding the effect of sales to wild oats  was 
sales to our largest customer  whole foods market represented approximately of net sales for the year ended july  whole foods market and wild oats represented approximately and  respectively  of net sales for the year ended july  our current distribution arrangement with whole foods market expires on august  gross profit our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
operating expenses our total operating expenses  excluding special items  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  our total operating expenses  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  excluding special charges  increased from for the year ended july  to for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  including special charges  increased from for the year ended july  to for the year ended july  special items are discussed below 
the increase in operating expenses was due primarily to the effect of the acquired businesses and lower productivity caused by the transition of the wild oats business 
we believe we will be able to decrease operating expenses as a percentage of sales as we focus on increasing market share to replace wild oats sales and integrating blooming prairie and northeast cooperative into our eastern region  resulting in more efficient routing and warehouse operations 
transportation  warehouse labor  and utilities costs continued to track at levels consistent with the prior year as a percentage of sales 
fuel expense  as a percentage of sales  increased approximately basis points compared to the prior year  due primarily to the marked increase in average diesel prices during the year 
the operating expense figures reflect the impact of the adoption of the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  which requires the reclassification of advertising income to cost of goods sold from operating expenses 
these changes reduced cost of sales and also increased operating expenses by million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
this accounting change had no impact on reported operating income  net income or earnings per share 
we may incur additional special charges as we increase our warehouse capacity 
operating income operating income  excluding the special items discussed below  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of sales  operating income  excluding special items  decreased to for the year ended july  compared to for the year ended july  operating income  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or of sales  for the year ended july  from million  or of sales  for the year ended july  other income expense other expense  excluding the change in fair value of financial instruments  remained relatively flat at million for the years ended july  and this consistency was primarily due to higher interest expense caused by a higher borrowing base  which was partially offset by lower interest rates and an increase in other income of million 
other expense  including the change in fair value of financial instruments  decreased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  this decrease was primarily due to a smaller decline in the fair value of our interest rate swap agreements and related option agreements resulting from unfavorable changes in yield curves used to determine the change in fair value 
we will continue to recognize either income or expense quarterly for the duration of the swap agreement until either october or for the swap agreement entered into in october  and either august or for the swap agreement entered into in august  depending on whether the agreements are extended by the counter party 
the recognition of income or expense in any given quarter  and the magnitude of that item  is dependent on interest rates and the remaining term of the contracts 
upon expiration of any such contract  the cumulative earnings impact from the changes in fair value of the instruments will be zero 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was and for the years ended july  and  respectively 
the effective rates were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes 
net income as a result of the foregoing  net income  excluding special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  net income  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  we expect earnings per diluted share in the range of for fiscal  excluding any potential special items 
special items the special items for the year ended july  included a goodwill impairment charge  inventory write down and restructuring and asset impairment charges related to our subsidiary  hershey  and moving and other costs related to the expansion of our chesterfield  new hampshire distribution facility 
in addition  the special items included costs related to the loss of a major customer and a non cash charge related to the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps and related option agreements caused by unfavorable changes in yield curves 
special items for the year ended july  consisted of a non cash charge related to the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps and related option agreements caused by unfavorable changes in yield curves as well as moving  asset impairment and redundant rent expense related to moving our atlanta  georgia distribution facility  incremental costs such as labor  utilities and rent related to the startup of our southern california distribution facility and labor  utilities  rent and severance related to relocating our subsidiary  hershey 
we entered into interest rate swap agreements in october  august and april the october and august agreements are ineffective hedges 
applicable accounting treatment requires that we record the changes in fair value of the october and august agreements in our consolidated statement of income  rather than within other comprehensive income in our statement of stockholders equity 
the changes in fair value are dependent upon the forward looking yield curves for each swap and are impossible for us to predict in our forward looking statements 
the april agreement is an effective hedge and therefore does not require this treatment 
we believe that our october and august agreements are special items that are excludable as non recurring items 
first  we only intend to enter into effective hedges going forward 
this stated intention began with the april agreement 
second  we believe that the october and august agreements may distort and confuse investors if the change in fair value cannot be treated as a special charge because their inclusion directly impacts our reported earnings per share 
a change in fair value  whether positive or negative  can significantly increase or decrease our reported earnings per share 
for example  we recorded a negative change in fair value for fiscal that decreased our earnings per share by 
if we were prohibited from excluding this item as a special charge  it would artificially deflate our reported earnings per share below our stated guidance and thereby mislead investors as to our condition

a reconciliation of specific adjustments to gaap results for the year ended july  and the same period last year is included in the financial tables shown above 
a description of our use of non gaap information is provided under use of non gaap results below 
year ended july  compared to year ended july  net sales our net sales increased approximately  or million  to billion for the year ended july  from billion for the year ended july  the increase was primarily due to growth in the supernatural and mass market distribution channels of approximately and  respectively 
also included in net sales for fiscal were sales for boulder fruit express  an organic produce and perishables distributor we acquired in november  and sales for a florida retail store we opened in october sales growth excluding the acquisition and the new store sales was 
sales to our two largest customers  whole foods market  and wild oats represented approximately and  respectively  of net sales for the year ended july  whole foods market represented approximately and wild oats represented approximately of net sales for the year ended july  gross profit our gross profit increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july   reflecting the reclassification upon adoption of eitf our gross profit as a percentage of net sales was for the years ended july  and july  operating expenses our operating expenses  excluding special items  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july   reflecting the reclassification upon adoption of eitf our operating expenses  including special items  increased by approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  excluding special items  decreased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  as a percentage of net sales  operating expenses  including special items  decreased to for the year ended july  from for the year ended july  special items are discussed below 
the lower operating expenses as a percentage of net sales were due primarily to increased efficiencies in our transportation departments as a result of more efficient routing and successfully leveraging our fixed expenses against a higher sales base 
we also experienced improved labor productivity due primarily to a more favorable labor market nationwide and a higher retention rate of experienced warehouse and transportation employees 
we experienced significant increases in workers compensation and commercial automobile insurance premiums 
the insurance premium market is somewhat volatile  and whether there is improvement or deterioration in future quarters is largely dependent on our ability to control our automobile and workers compensation losses  which are retained risks 
we have reduced our operating expenses  excluding special charges  to of sales by continuing to realize operating efficiencies and expanding our sales base 
operating income operating income  excluding the special items discussed below  increased approximately  or million  to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  as a percentage of sales  operating income  excluding special items  increased to for the year ended july  compared to for the year ended july  operating income  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or of sales  for the year ended july  from million  or of sales  for the year ended july  other income expense other expense  excluding the change in fair value of financial instruments  increased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  this increase was primarily due to higher interest expense caused by a higher borrowing base  partially offset by lower interest rates 
other expense  including the change in fair value of financial instruments  increased million to million for the year ended july  from million for the year ended july  this increase was primarily due to the decrease in fair value on our interest rate swap agreements and related option agreements resulting from unfavorable changes in yield curves used to determine the change in fair value 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was for the years ended july  and the effective rates were higher than the federal statutory rate primarily due to state and local income taxes 
net income as a result of the foregoing  net income  excluding special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july   compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  net income  including special items  increased approximately  or million  to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  compared to million  or per diluted share  for the year ended july  special items the special items for the year ended july  included a non cash charge related to the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps and related option agreements caused by unfavorable changes in yield curves  relocation  asset impairment and redundant rent expense related to moving our atlanta  georgia distribution facility  incremental costs such as labor  utilities and rent related to the startup of our southern california distribution facility and labor  utilities  rent and severance related to relocating hershey 
special items for the year ended july  consisted of a non cash charge related to the change in the fair value of interest rate swaps and related option agreements caused by unfavorable changes in yield curves  costs related to the expansion of our new oxford  pennsylvania distribution facility and asset impairment charges  primarily goodwill  associated with closing an unprofitable retail store 
see disclosure above regarding our belief that our interest rate swap agreements are special items that should be excluded as non recurring items

liquidity and capital resources we finance operations and growth primarily with cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit facility  operating and capital leases  trade payables  bank indebtedness and the sale of equity and debt securities 
in september  we entered into an agreement to increase our secured revolving credit facility to million from million at an interest rate of libor plus maturing on june  this additional access to capital provides for working capital requirements in the normal course of business and the opportunity to grow our business organically or through acquisitions 
as of july   our borrowing base  based on accounts receivable and inventory levels  was million with remaining availability of million 
in april  we executed an amendment to our loan and security agreement  which released and discharged real estate mortgages on certain real property 
additionally  in april we executed a term loan agreement in the principal amount of million secured by the real property that was released in accordance with the aforementioned amendment 
the million term loan is repayable over seven years based on a fifteen year amortization schedule 
interest on the term loan accrues at libor plus 
proceeds received from the term loan were used to reduce the outstanding balance on our million credit facility on which interest accrues at the new york prime rate or the banks london interbank offered rate libor plus 
we believe that our capital requirements for fiscal will be in the to million range  and that we will finance these requirements with cash generated from operations and the use of our existing credit facilities 
approximately million of the capital required for the expansion of our distribution facilities will be financed through additional long term debt with terms and conditions similar to the existing million term loan  with the same financial institutions 
we believe that our future capital requirements will be similar to our anticipated fiscal requirements  as we continue to invest in our growth by upgrading our infrastructure and expanding our facilities 
future investments in acquisitions will be financed through either equity or long term debt negotiated at the time of the potential acquisition 
net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended july  and was the result of cash collected from customers net of cash paid to vendors  partially offset by investments in inventory 
the increases in inventory levels relate to supporting increased sales with wider product assortment combined with our ability to capture purchasing efficiency opportunities in excess of total carrying costs  as well as our acquisitions of blooming prairie and northeast cooperative 
days in inventory was consistent at july  and at days 
days sales outstanding at july  was days compared to days at july  net cash provided by operations was million for the year ended july  and was due to cash collected from customers  net of cash paid to vendors  exceeding our investments in accounts receivable and inventory 
working capital at july  was million 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended july  and was due primarily to the purchase of substantially all the assets of blooming prairie  the merger with privately held northeast cooperative  and the expansion of our chesterfield  new hampshire facility  compared to million for the same period last year that was due primarily to capital expenditures for the purchase of our new atlanta  georgia facility and equipment purchases for our fontana  california facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended july  due to proceeds from the issuance of a million term loan agreement and proceeds from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by repayments of long term debt and repayments on our million secured revolving credit facility 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended july  due to increased borrowings on our line of credit and our equipment financing lines  offset by the repayment of long term debt as a result of the establishment of the million secured revolving credit facility 
in october  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement 
the agreement provides for us to pay interest for a five year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing our effective rate at 
the five year term of the swap agreement may be extended to seven years at the option of the counter party  which prohibits accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement effective august  the additional agreement provides for us to pay interest for a four year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing our effective rate on the notional amount at 
if libor exceeds in a given period the agreement is suspended for that period 
libor was as of july  the four year term of the swap agreement may be extended to six years at the option of the counter party  which prohibits accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under sfas in may  we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement 
the agreement provides for us to pay interest for a seven year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing our effective rate on the notional amount at 
the swap agreement qualifies as an effective hedge under sfas no 
impact of inflation historically  we have been able to pass along inflation related increases 
consequently  inflation has not had a material impact upon the results of our operations or profitability 
seasonality generally  we do not experience any material seasonality 
however  our sales and operating results may vary significantly from quarter to quarter due to factors such as changes in our operating expenses  management s ability to execute our operating and growth strategies  personnel changes  demand for natural products  supply shortages and general economic conditions 
recently issued financial accounting standards emerging issues task force issue no 
 accounting by a reseller for cash consideration received  became effective for us during the third quarter of fiscal this issue addresses the appropriate accounting for cash consideration received from a vendor 
the consensus reached on this issue was that cash consideration received from a vendor is presumed to be a reduction of the cost of sales and should be recorded as a reduction of cost of goods sold unless the consideration is for either payment for assets or services and therefore revenue or a reimbursement of specific  incremental  identifiable costs incurred to sell the vendor s products and therefore  a reduction of advertising expense 
we do not track costs on a specific vendor basis 
therefore  we were required to classify vendor consideration received for advertising as a reduction in cost of sales 
vendor payments received for advertising arrangements formerly classified as reductions of operating expenses have been reclassified as a reduction of cost of sales for all the periods presented 
these changes reduce cost of sales and also increase operating expenses by million  million and million for the years ended july   and  respectively 
this accounting change had no impact on reported operating income  net income or earnings per share for any of the periods presented

use of non gaap results financial measures included in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that are not in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap are referred to as non gaap financial measures 
to supplement our financial statements presented on a gaap basis  we use non gaap additional measures of operating results  net earnings and earnings per share adjusted to exclude special charges 
we believe that the use of these additional measures is appropriate to enhance an overall understanding of our past financial performance and also our prospects for the future as these special charges are not expected to be part of our ongoing business 
the adjustments to our gaap results are made with the intent of providing both management and investors with a more complete understanding of the underlying operational results and trends and its marketplace performance 
for example  these adjusted non gaap results are among the primary indicators management uses as a basis for our planning and forecasting of future periods 
the presentation of this additional information is not meant to be considered in isolation or as a substitute for net earnings or diluted earnings per share prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states 
a comparison and reconciliation from non gaap to gaap results is included in the tables above 
certain factors that may affect future results this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements that involve substantial risks and uncertainties 
in some cases you can identify these statements by forward looking words such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  intend  may  should  will  and would  or similar words 
you should read statements that contain these words carefully because they discuss future expectations  contain projections of future results of operations or of financial position or state other forward looking information 
the important factors listed below as well as any cautionary language in this annual report on form k  provide examples of risks  uncertainties and events that may cause our actual results to differ materially from the expectations described in these forward looking statements 
you should be aware that the occurrence of the events described in the risk factors below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k could have an adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial position 
any forward looking statements in this annual report on form k and the documents incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k are not guarantees of future performance  and actual results  developments and business decisions may differ from those envisaged by such forward looking statements  possibly materially 
we do not undertake to update any information in the foregoing reports until the effective date of our future reports required by applicable laws 
any projections of future results of operations should not be construed in any manner as a guarantee that such results will in fact occur 
these projections are subject to change and could differ materially from final reported results 
we may from time to time update these publicly announced projections  but we are not obligated to do so 
acquisitions we continually evaluate opportunities to acquire other companies 
we believe that there are risks related to acquiring companies including overpaying for acquisitions  losing key employees of acquired companies and failing to achieve potential synergies 
additionally  our business could be adversely affected if we are unable to integrate our acquisitions and mergers 
a significant portion of our historical growth has been achieved through acquisitions of or mergers with other distributors of natural products 
successful integration of mergers is critical to our future operating and financial performance 
integration requires  among other things the optimization of delivery routes  coordination of administrative  distribution and finance functions  the integration of management information systems and personnel  and maintaining customer base 
the integration process has and could divert the attention of management and any difficulties or problems encountered in the transition process could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
in addition  the process of combining companies has and could cause the interruption of  or a loss of momentum in  the activities of the respective businesses  which could have an adverse effect on their combined operations 
there can be no assurance that we will realize any of the anticipated benefits of mergers 
we may have difficulty in managing our growth the growth in the size of our business and operations has placed and is expected to continue to place a significant strain on our management 
our future growth is limited in part by the size and location of our distribution centers 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully expand our existing distribution facilities or open new distribution facilities in new or existing markets to facilitate growth 
in addition  our growth strategy to expand our market presence includes possible additional acquisitions 
to the extent our future growth includes acquisitions  there can be no assurance that we will successfully identify suitable acquisition candidates  consummate and integrate such potential acquisitions or expand into new markets 
our ability to compete effectively and to manage future growth  if any  will depend on our ability to continue to implement and improve operational  financial and management information systems on a timely basis and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
there can be no assurance that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our operations 
our inability to manage our growth effectively could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have significant competition from a variety of sources we operate in competitive markets  and our future success will be largely dependent on our ability to provide quality products and services at competitive prices 
our competition comes from a variety of sources  including other distributors of natural products as well as specialty grocery and mass market grocery distributors 
there can be no assurance that mass market grocery distributors will not increase their emphasis on natural products and more directly compete with us or that new competitors will not enter the market 
these distributors may have been in business longer than us  may have substantially greater financial and other resources than us and may be better established in their markets 
there can be no assurance that our current or potential competitors will not provide services comparable or superior to those provided by us or adapt more quickly than we do to evolving industry trends or changing market requirements 
it is also possible that alliances among competitors may develop and rapidly acquire significant market share or that certain of our customers will increase distribution to their own retail facilities 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to compete effectively against current and future competitors 
we depend heavily on our principal customer our current distribution arrangement with our top customer  whole foods market  is effective through august  whole foods market accounted for approximately and of our net sales during the fiscal years ended july  and  respectively 
as a result of this concentration of our customer base  the loss or cancellation of business from whole foods market including from increased distribution to its own facilities  could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we sell products under purchase orders  and we generally have no agreements with or commitments from our customers for the purchase of products 
no assurance can be given that our customers will maintain or increase their sales volumes or orders for the products supplied by us or that we will be able to maintain or add to our existing customer base 
our profit margins may decrease due to consolidation in the grocery industry the grocery distribution industry generally is characterized by relatively high volume with relatively low profit margins 
the continuing consolidation of retailers in the natural products industry and the growth of super natural chains may reduce our profit margins in the future as more customers qualify for greater volume discounts 
our operations are sensitive to economic downturns the grocery industry is also sensitive to national and regional economic conditions  and the demand for our products may be adversely affected from time to time by economic downturns 
in addition  our operating results are particularly sensitive to  and may be materially adversely affected by difficulties with the collectibility of accounts receivable  difficulties with inventory control  competitive pricing pressures  and unexpected increases in fuel or other transportation related costs 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we are dependent on a number of key executives management of our business is substantially dependent upon the services of steven h 
townsend  president and chief executive officer  rick d 
puckett  chief financial officer  dan atwood  president of united natural brands  senior vice president and secretary  rick antonelli  president of our eastern region and other key management employees 
loss of the services of any officers or any other key management employee could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our operating results are subject to significant fluctuations our net sales and operating results may vary significantly from period to period due to changes in our operating expenses  including in fuel and insurance  management s ability to execute our business and growth strategies  personnel changes  demand for natural products  supply shortages  general economic conditions  changes in customer preferences and demands for natural products  including levels of enthusiasm for health  fitness and environmental issues  fluctuation of natural product prices due to competitive pressures  lack of an adequate supply of high quality agricultural products due to poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  volatility in prices of high quality agricultural products resulting from poor growing conditions  natural disasters or otherwise  and future acquisitions  particularly in periods immediately following the consummation of such acquisition transactions while the operations of the acquired businesses are being integrated into our operations 
due to the foregoing factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results may not necessarily be meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
we are subject to significant governmental regulation our business is highly regulated at the federal  state and local levels and our products and distribution operations require various licenses  permits and approvals 
in particular our products are subject to inspection by the us food and drug administration  our warehouse and distribution facilities are subject to inspection by the us department of agriculture and state health authorities  and the us department of transportation and the us federal highway administration regulate our trucking operations 
the loss or revocation of any existing licenses  permits or approvals or the failure to obtain any additional licenses  permits or approvals in new jurisdictions where we intend to do business could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
union organizing activities could cause labor relations difficulties as of july   we had approximately  full and part time employees 
an aggregate of approximately  or  of the employees at our auburn  washington  iowa city  iowa and edison  new jersey facilities are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
these agreements expire in march  june and june  respectively 
we have in the past been the focus of union organizing efforts 
as we increase our employee base and broaden our distribution operations to new geographic markets  our increased visibility could result in increased or expanded union organizing efforts 
although we have not experienced a work stoppage to date  if additional employees were to unionize  we could be subject to work stoppages and increases in labor costs  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition or results of operations 
access to capital and the cost of that capital we have a secured revolving credit facility with available credit under it of million at an interest rate of libor plus maturing on june  as of july   our borrowing base  based on accounts receivable and inventory levels  was million with remaining availability of million 
in april  we executed a term loan agreement in the principal amount of million secured by real property that was released in accordance with an amendment to the loan and security agreement related to the revolving credit facility 
the million term loan is repayable over seven years based on a fifteen year amortization schedule 
interest on the term loan accrues at libor plus 
in order to maintain our profit margins  we rely on strategic investment buying initiatives  such as discounted bulk purchases  which require spending significant amounts of working capital 
in the event that our cost of capital increases or our ability to borrow funds or raise equity capital is limited  we could suffer reduced profit margins and be unable to grow our business organically or through acquisitions  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to interest rate fluctuations on our borrowings 
as more fully described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we use interest rate swap agreements to modify variable rate obligations to fixed rate obligations 
beginning in  we began managing our debt portfolio by using interest rate swaps to achieve a desired mix of fixed rates 
at july   we had two interest rate swaps relating to our million revolving credit facility 
the swaps convert million in notional amounts from floating rate to a fixed rate 
the interest rate swap agreement entered into in october swap is a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing our effective rate at 
the five year term of the swap agreement may be extended to seven years at the option of the counter party  which prohibits accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under sfas no 
sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
we entered into an additional interest rate swap agreement effective august swap 
the additional agreement provides for the company to pay interest for a four year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current and anticipated variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing the company s effective rate on the notional amount at 
if libor exceeds in a given period the agreement is suspended for that period 
the four year term of the swap agreement may be extended to six years at the option of the counter party  which prohibits accounting for the swap as an effective hedge under sfas the fair market value of these derivatives was approximately million 
with all other variables remaining constant  a basis point change in libor on the october swap would have yielded a  change in fair value at july  with all other variables remaining constant  a basis point change in libor on the swap would have yielded a  change in fair value at july  we account for our interest rate swap agreement entered into during may swap using hedge accounting treatment as the derivative has been determined to be highly effective in achieving offsetting changes in fair value of the hedged items 
the agreement provides for us to pay interest for a seven year period at a fixed rate of on a notional principal amount of million while receiving interest for the same period at the libor rate on the same notional principal amount 
the swap has been entered into as a hedge against libor interest rate movements on current variable rate indebtedness totaling million at libor plus  thereby fixing our effective rate on the notional amount at 
under this method of accounting  at july   we recorded a million asset representing gross unrealized gains on this derivative  and a corresponding credit to accumulated other comprehensive income in the statement of stockholders equity 
we do not enter into derivative agreements for trading purposes
