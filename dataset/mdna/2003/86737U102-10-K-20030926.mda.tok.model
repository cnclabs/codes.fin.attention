item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following table sets forth the percentage of the patient days from various payors in sunlink s owned or leased hospitals for the periods indicated 
fiscal year ended june  fiscal year ended june  three months ended june  two months ended march  source medicare medicaid private and other sources total the following table sets forth the percentage of the net patient revenues from various payors in sunlink s owned or leased hospitals 
fiscal year ended june  fiscal year ended june  three months ended june  two months ended march  source medicare medicaid private and other sources total medicare is a federal program that provides certain hospital and medical insurance benefits to persons age and over  some disabled persons and persons with end stage renal disease 
medicaid is a federal state program  administered by the states  that provides hospital and nursing home benefits to qualifying individuals who are unable to afford care 
all of sunlink s hospitals are certified as healthcare services providers for persons covered by medicare and medicaid programs 
amounts received under the medicare and medicaid programs generally are significantly less than the established charges of most hospitals  including our own  for the services provided 
patients generally are not responsible for any difference between established hospital charges and amounts reimbursed for such services under medicare  medicaid  some private insurer plans  hmos or ppos  but are responsible to the extent of any exclusions  deductibles or co insurance features of their coverage 
the amount of such exclusions  deductibles and co insurance has been increasing in recent years 
collection of amounts due from individuals typically is more difficult than from governmental or third party payors 
management information systems sunlink utilizes commercially available management information systems at our hospitals  four of which utilize a comprehensive system designed for larger hospitals and two of which utilize a system designed for smaller hospitals 
each system includes features such as a general ledger  patient accounting  billing  accounts receivable  payroll  accounts payable  medical records and materials management 
sunlink maintains a small staff and limited equipment to complement the hospital systems and to report combined and individual data for corporate management  monitoring and compliance purposes 
our goal is to convert all of our hospitals to a single management information system upon expiration of our existing systems agreements  which unexpired terms range from two to four years 
quality assurance each sunlink hospital implements quality assurance procedures to monitor the level and quality of care provided to its patients 
each hospital has a medical director who supervises and is responsible for the quality of medical care provided and a medical advisory committee comprised of physicians who review the professional credentials of physicians applying for medical staff privileges at the hospital 
the medical advisory committee also reviews and monitors surgical outcomes along with procedures performed and the quality of the logistical  medical and technological support provided to the physicians 
each hospital periodically conducts surveys of its patients  either during their stay at the hospital or subsequently by mail  to identify potential areas of improvement 
each sunlink hospital  other than the leased hospital in dexter  missouri  is accredited by the joint commission of accreditation of healthcare organizations  also known as jcaho 
regulatory compliance program sunlink maintains a company wide compliance program under the direction of jerome orth  vice president  technical and compliance services 
mr 
orth has over twenty five years experience in reimbursement in multi hospital corporations  at both the facility and corporate level 
sunlink s compliance program is directed at all areas of regulatory compliance  including physician recruitment  reimbursement and cost reporting practices  and laboratory and home healthcare operations 
each hospital designates a compliance officer and develops plans to correct problems should they arise 
in addition  all employees are provided with a copy of and given an introduction to sunlink s code of conduct  which includes ethical and compliance guidelines and instructions about the proper resources to utilize in order to address any concerns that may arise 
each hospital conducts annual training to re emphasize sunlink s code of conduct 
we monitor our corporate compliance program to respond to developments in healthcare regulations and the industry 
sunlink also maintains a toll free hotline to permit employees to report compliance concerns on an anonymous basis 
competition among the factors which we believe influence patient selection among hospitals in exurban markets are the appearance and functionality of the healthcare facilities  the quality and demeanor of professional staff and physicians  and the participation of the hospital in plans which pay a portion of the patient s bill 
such factors are influenced heavily by the quality and scope of medical services  strength of referral networks  hospital location and the price of hospital services 
although our hospitals may face less competition in their immediate patient service areas than would be expected in larger communities  since they are the primary provider of healthcare services in their respective communities  our hospitals nevertheless face competition from larger tertiary care centers and  in some cases  other rural  exurban  suburban or  in limited circumstances  urban hospitals  some of which  particularly large urban hospitals offer more specialized services 
the competing hospitals may be owned by governmental agencies or not for profit entities supported by endowments and charitable contributions and may be able to finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis 
such governmental owned and not for profit hospitals  as well as for profit hospitals operating in the service area  likely have greater access to financial resources than do sunlink hospitals 
medical staff the number and quality of physicians affiliated with a hospital directly affects the quality and availability of patient care and the reputation of such hospital 
physicians generally may terminate their affiliation with a hospital at any time 
we seek to retain physicians of varied specialties on the medical staffs of our hospitals and to attract other qualified physicians 
sunlink believes physicians refer patients to a hospital primarily on the basis of the quality of services the hospital renders to patients and physicians  the quality of other physicians on the medical staff  the location of the hospital and the quality of the hospital s facilities  equipment and employees 
accordingly  sunlink strives to provide quality facilities  equipment  employees and services for physicians and their patients 
managed care and efforts to control healthcare costs each sunlink hospital is somewhat dependent on its ability to negotiate service contracts with purchasers of group healthcare services 
health maintenance organizations and preferred provider organizations attempt to direct and control the use of hospital services through managed care programs and to obtain discounts from hospitals established charges 
in addition  employers and traditional health insurers increasingly are seeking to contain costs through negotiations with hospitals for managed care programs and discounts from established charges 
generally  hospitals compete for service contracts with group healthcare service purchasers on the basis of market reputation  geographic location  quality and range of services  quality of medical staff  convenience and price 
the importance of obtaining contracts with managed care organizations varies from market to market  depending on the market strength of such organizations 
on an industry basis  managed care contracts generally are less important in the exurban markets than in urban and suburban markets where there is typically a higher level of managed care penetration 
nevertheless  a significant portion of hospital patients in rural and exurban communities are covered by managed care or other reimbursement programs which pay less than established charges for hospital services 
the healthcare industry  as a whole  faces the challenge of continuing to provide quality patient care while managing rising costs  facing strong competition for patients and adjusting to a general reduction of reimbursement rates by both private and government payors 
both private and government payors continually seek to reduce the nature and scope of services which may be reimbursed 
healthcare reform at both the federal and state level generally is designed to reduce reimbursement rates 
changes in medical technology  existing and future legislation  regulations and interpretations  and competitive contracting for provider services by private and government payors  may require changes in facilities  equipment  personnel  rates and or services in the future 
the hospital industry  including all of sunlink s hospitals  continues to have significant unused capacity 
inpatient utilization  average lengths of stay and average inpatient occupancy rates continue to be affected negatively by payor required pre admission authorization  utilization review and payment mechanisms designed to maximize outpatient and alternative healthcare delivery services for less acutely ill patients and to limit the cost of treating inpatients 
admissions constraints  payor pressures and increased competition are likely to continue and we expect to continue to respond to such trends by adding and expanding outpatient services  upgrading facilities and equipment  offering new program and adding or expanding certain inpatient and ancillary services 
acquisition strategy our priority is to improve the profitability of our existing hospitals 
we monitor the market for community hospitals which are or may be available for purchase 
we face competition for acquisitions primarily from for profit hospital management companies and not for profit entities which may have greater financial and other resources than sunlink 
increased competition for the acquisition of non urbanacute care hospitals could have an adverse impact on sunlink s ability to acquire such hospitals on favorable terms 
in recent years  the legislatures and attorney generals of several states  including certain states which we believe may have suitable acquisition targets  have shown a heightened level of interest in reviewing transactions involving the sale of not for profit hospitals 
although the level of interest varies from state to state  the trend is to require increased governmental review  and  in some cases  approval of transactions involving a not for profit corporation selling a healthcare facility 
healthmont acquisition on october   sunlink announced that it and a wholly owned subsidiary of sunlink had signed a definitive merger agreement to acquire all of the outstanding capital stock of healthmont  inc healthmont  a privately held operator of community hospitals 
if the transaction is consummated  sunlink would acquire two community hospitals memorial hospital of adel  a bed acute care facility in adel  georgia  which includes a bed nursing home  and callaway community hospital  a bed acute care hospital in fulton  missouri 
upon completion of the merger  sunlink would operate eight community hospitals with a total of beds 
on january   sunlink received a letter from healthmont purporting to conclude that a sale offer healthmont received from a third party was a superior proposal within the terms of the merger agreement 
although the merger agreement remained in full force and effect  capitalized costs of relating to the merger through december  were expensed in the quarter ended december  because  at that time  sunlink could no longer determine that it was probable that the healthmont merger would be completed 
on march   sunlink and healthmont announced the merger agreement had been amended and modified 
sunlink and healthmont agreed to extend the merger agreement through june  sunlink also agreed to extend a loan to healthmont of up to  of which was loaned on march  to allow healthmont to repay senior debt of approximately in connection with the sale of its hospital in san benito  texas  which sunlink would not acquire 
additionally  on march   sunlink assumed management of healthmont s adel  georgia and fulton  missouri hospitals under a management agreement expiring on august  for a fee of per month 
a commitment for a proposed  year secured term loan to sunlink was modified in connection with the amended merger agreement to allow sunlink to borrow up to prior to the closing of the merger 
such amount was borrowed in march through the sale of of sunlink s notes and was used as partial funding for sunlink s  loan to healthmont 
the remaining  loan commitment will be used for payment of certain transaction costs and for working capital needs 
the notes and the term loan borrowings will bear an interest rate of per annum 
the notes require and the remaining term loans borrowings will require sunlink to pay certain fees 
sunlink will also issue warrants to purchase  of its common shares at an exercise price of per share  of which  warrants were issued in march in connection with the term loan 
on june   sunlink and healthmont announced the merger agreement had been further amended and modified to extend the merger agreement through september  sunlink also agreed to extend a loan to healthmont of up to  all of which had been loaned on september  under the terms of the merger agreement as amended  sunlink would  among other things  issue to the shareholders of healthmont up to  common shares of sunlink in consideration for all issued and outstanding capital stock of healthmont 
healthmont currently has approximately shareholders and approximately  healthmont shares are expected to be outstanding immediately prior to closing 
each healthmont shareholder is expected to receive one common share of sunlink for each healthmont shares approximately of a common share of sunlink for each share of healthmont  or a total of approximately  sunlink common shares 
in addition  sunlink would issue  common shares in connection with the transaction to settle certain contractual obligations of healthmont to its officers and directors 
sunlink would also become obligated to issue approximately  common shares upon exercise of outstanding healthmont options 
in connection with the transaction  sunlink would also assume healthmont s debt  currently approximately  subject to a number of conditions  healthmont obtained the consent of its senior lender to the proposed merger of healthmont with sunlink and the modification of certain terms of healthmont s senior debt  including an extension of the maturity date of the debt to august  upon completion of the merger  healthmont s senior lender would hold warrants to purchase  shares of sunlink s common shares at an exercise price of per share 
certain healthmont investors have arranged letters of credit which support up to  of healthmont s revolving credit loans with healthmont s senior lender 
subject to completion of the merger  sunlink has agreed  in the event the letters of credit are drawn and the proceeds are applied to the outstanding balance of the revolving credit loans  to issue to such letter of credit obligors  of sunlink common shares in full satisfaction of healthmont s reimbursement obligations under the letters of credit 
sunlink would also pay to such letter of creditor obligors a commitment fee annually through august  in consideration of their obligations to maintain the letters of credit in effect 
based on the average market price of sunlink s common shares of per share calculated based on the price two days before  the day of and two days after the amended merger agreement was entered into  plus the amount of senior debt and capital lease obligations expected to be assumed  plus currently estimated transaction costs  the price to sunlink of the transaction would be approximately  on january   sunlink filed its preliminary joint proxy registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission for a special shareholders meeting to vote on the proposed merger 
on april  and august   sunlink filed amendments to its preliminary joint proxy registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
on august   sunlink filed a final amendment to its preliminary joint proxy registration statement on form s with the securities and exchange commission 
on august   the securities and exchange commission declared the registration statement effective for the issuance of sunlink s common shares in connection with the acquisition of healthmont 
the mailing of the joint proxy prospectus for the special shareholder meeting commenced on august  the transaction was approved by healthmont s shareholders on september  and sunlink s shareholders on september  at each company s respective special meeting of shareholders 
completion of the merger is subject to financing arrangements expected to be completed by september  the net revenues of the two healthmont facilities to be acquired through the merger were approximately  as reported by healthmont for the twelve months ended march  sunlink does not plan to add any corporate staff or to significantly increase its overhead as a result of the merger 
sunlink will not acquire healthmont s corporate staff and offices in connection with the merger 
upon consummation of the merger  the board of directors of sunlink intends to elect gene burleson  a current healthmont director  to the unexpired term of ronald j 
vannuki  who would step down from sunlink s board 
sunlink also has agreed to nominate mr 
burleson for election by its shareholders to a two year term on its board of directors at its annual meeting 
government reimbursement programs medicare medicaid reimbursement a significant portion of sunlink s net revenues is dependent upon reimbursement from medicare and medicaid programs 
the medicare program pays hospitals under the provisions of a prospective payment system for inpatient services 
under the prospective payment system  a hospital receives a fixed amount for inpatient hospital services based on the established fixed payment amount per discharge for categories of hospital treatment  known as diagnosis related group drg payments 
drg payments do not consider a specific hospital s costs  but are national rates adjusted for area wage differentials and case mix indices 
long term care psychiatric units within hospitals along with certain other services generally not provided in our facilities currently are exempt from the prospective payment system and are reimbursed under the provisions of a cost based system  subject to specific reimbursement caps 
although the federal government reviews payment rates annually  the percentage increases to drg payment rates for the last several years have been lower than the percentage increases in the related cost of goods and services provided by general hospitals 
the index used to adjust the drg payment rates is based on a price statistic  known as the centers for medicare and medicaid services market basket index  reduced by congressionally mandated reduction factors 
drg rate increases were     and for federal fiscal years     and respectively 
the balanced budget act of set the increase in drg payment rates for future federal fiscal years at rates that are based on the market basket rates less reduction factors of in and in and the medicare  medicaid and health benefits improvement and protection act of bipa amended the balanced budget act of by giving hospitals a full market basket increase in fiscal and market basket increases minus in fiscal years and in addition  bipa contains provisions delaying scheduled reductions in payment for home health agencies and other provisions designed to lessen the impact on providers of spending reductions contained in the balanced budget act of the medicare program historically has set aside of medicare inpatient payments to pay for outlier cases 
outlier cases are specific cases that exceed published thresholds days or cost for which additional payments outlier payments are received  based on a pre determined formula  over and above the drg rate for that specific case 
during federal fiscal year  medicare projected that payments for outlier cases had exceeded the and  therefore  increased the cost threshold for federal fiscal year  which reduced total payments for outlier cases 
for federal fiscal year  medicare again increased the cost threshold  which will reduce total payments for outlier cases 
for federal fiscal year  medicare has not only increased the cost threshold  thus reducing total payments for outlier cases  but also has changed the rules to apply the cost threshold after the drg rate plus indirect medical education and disproportionate share payments 
historically  sunlink facilities have had little or no outlier cases 
this trend is not expected to change in future periods and therefore the changes in outlier payments should not have any significant impact on sunlink s facilities 
most outpatient services provided by general hospitals are reimbursed by medicare under the outpatient prospective payment system 
the balanced budget act of mandated the implementation of the prospective payment system for medicare outpatient services 
this outpatient prospective payment system is based on a system of ambulatory payment classifications apc 
each apc is designed to represent a bundle of outpatient services  and each apc is assigned a fully prospective reimbursement rate 
bipa also improved the apc rate update factor for calendar year from market basket minus to market basket plus 
for calendar years and  the update factor remains at a market basket of and  respectively 
the calendar year apc update is an average that includes a update for rural facilities 
four of sunlink s six facilities are classified as rural 
in addition to the standard drg payment  the social security act requires additional medicare payments be made to hospitals with a disproportionate share of low income patients 
bipa provisions  effective for services provided on and after april   stipulate that rural facilities with fewer than beds with a disproportionate share percentage greater than will be classified as a disproportionate share hospital entitled to receive a supplemental disproportionate share payment based on gross drg payments 
for discharges between april  and september  the disproportionate share payment was  from october  through september  the effective disproportionate share payment was  and beginning october  is of drg payments 
all of our hospitals were classified as disproportionate share hospitals at june  medicare disproportionate share payments are estimated to represent approximately of net patient care revenues for the years ended june  and  and for the months ended june  prior to april   none of our facilities qualified for medicare disproportionate payments under the regulations in effect at that time 
each state operates a medicaid program funded jointly by the state and the federal government 
federal law governs the general management of the medicaid program  but there is wide latitude for states to customize medicaid programs to fit local needs and resources 
as a result  each state medicaid plan has its own payment formula and recipient eligibility criteria 
government reimbursement program adjustments the medicare  medicaid and tricare programs are subject to statutory and regulatory changes  administrative rulings  interpretations and determinations  requirements for utilization review and new governmental funding restrictions  all of which may materially increase or decrease program payments as well as affect the cost of providing services and the timing of payments to facilities 
all hospitals participating in the medicare and medicaid programs  whether paid on a reasonable cost basis or under a prospective payment system  are required to meet certain financial reporting requirements 
federal and  where applicable  state regulations require the submission of annual cost reports covering the revenue  costs and expenses associated with the services provided by each hospital to medicare beneficiaries and medicaid recipients 
annual cost reports required under the medicare and medicaid programs are subject to routine audits which may result in adjustments to the amounts ultimately determined to be due to sunlink under these reimbursement programs 
these audits often require several years to reach the final determination of amounts due 
providers also have rights of appeal  and it is common to contest issues raised in audits of prior years cost reports 
although the final outcome of these audits and the nature and amounts of any adjustments are difficult to predict  we believe that we have made adequate provisions in our financial statements for adjustments that may result from these audits and that final resolution of any contested issues should not have a material adverse effect upon our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
until final adjustment  however  significant issues remain unresolved and previously determined allowances could become either inadequate or greater than ultimately required 
if sunlink or any of our facilities were found to be in violation of federal or state laws relating to medicare  medicaid or similar programs  sunlink could be subject to substantial monetary fines  civil penalties and exclusion from future participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
any such sanctions could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
healthcare regulation overview the healthcare industry is one of the largest industries in the united states and continues to attract much legislative interest and public attention 
there are many factors that are highly significant to the healthcare industry including medicare  medicaid  other public and private hospital cost containment programs  proposals to limit healthcare spending and proposals to limit prices and industry competition factors 
the healthcare industry is governed by an extremely complex framework of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations 
there continue to be federal and state proposals that would  and actions that do  impose limitations on government and private payments to providers  including community hospitals 
in addition  there regularly are proposals to increase co payments and deductibles from program and private patients 
hospital facilities also are affected by controls imposed by government and private payors designed to reduce admissions and lengths of stay 
such controls  including what is commonly referred to as utilization review  have resulted in a decrease in certain treatments and procedures being performed 
utilization review entails the review of a patient s admission and course of treatment by a third party 
utilization review by third party peer review organizations is required in connection with the provision of care which is to be funded by medicare and medicaid 
utilization review by third parties also is required under many managed care arrangements 
many states have enacted  or are considering enacting  measures that are designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures and to make changes to private healthcare insurance 
various states have applied  or are considering applying  for a waiver from current medicaid regulations in order to allow them to serve some of their medicaid participants through managed care providers 
these proposals also may attempt to include coverage for some people who presently are uninsured  and generally could have the effect of reducing payments to hospitals  physicians and other providers for the same level of service provided under medicaid 
certificate of need requirements a number of states require approval for the purchase  construction  and expansion of healthcare facilities  including findings of need for additional or expanded healthcare facilities or services 
certificates of need con  which are issued by governmental agencies with jurisdiction over healthcare facilities  are at times required for capital expenditures exceeding a prescribed amount  changes in bed capacity or services and certain other matters 
all four states in which sunlink currently operates hospitals alabama  georgia  mississippi and missouri have con laws 
the states periodically review  modify and revise their con laws and related regulations 
in addition  future hospital acquisitions may occur in states that require certificates of need 
sunlink is unable to predict whether its hospitals will be able to obtain any certificates of need that may be necessary to accomplish their business objectives in any jurisdiction where such certificates of need are required 
anti kickback and self referral regulations sections of the anti fraud and abuse amendments to the social security act  commonly known as the anti kickback statute  prohibit certain business practices and relationships that might influence the provision and cost of healthcare services reimbursable under medicaid  medicare or other federal healthcare programs  including the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients whose care will be funded by medicare or other government programs 
sanctions for violating the anti kickback statute include criminal penalties and civil sanctions  including fines and possible exclusion from future participation in government programs  such as medicare and medicaid 
pursuant to the medicare and medicaid patient and program protection act of  the us department of health and human services hhs issued regulations that create safe harbors under the anti kickback statute 
a given business arrangement that does not fall within an enumerated safe harbor is not per se illegal  however  business arrangements that fail to satisfy the applicable safe harbor criteria are subject to increased scrutiny by enforcement authorities 
the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  which became effective january   added several new fraud and abuse laws 
these new laws cover all health insurance programs  private as well as governmental 
in addition  hipaa broadened the scope of certain fraud and abuse laws  such as the anti kickback statute  to include not just medicare and medicaid services  but all healthcare services reimbursed under a federal or state healthcare program 
there is increasing scrutiny by law enforcement authorities  the office of inspector general of the hhs  the courts and the us congress of arrangements between healthcare providers and potential referral sources to ensure that the arrangements are not designed as mechanisms to exchange remuneration for patient care referrals and opportunities 
investigators also have demonstrated a willingness to look behind the formalities of a business transaction to determine the underlying purpose of payments between healthcare providers and potential referral sources 
enforcement actions have increased  as is evidenced by highly publicized enforcement investigations of certain hospital activities 
in addition  provisions of the social security act  known as the stark act  also prohibit physicians from referring medicare and medicaid patients to providers of a broad range of designated health services with which the physicians or their immediate family members have ownership or certain other financial arrangements 
certain exceptions are available for employment agreements  leases  physician recruitment and certain other physician arrangements 
a person making a referral  or seeking payment for services referred  in violation of the stark act is subject to civil monetary penalties of up to  for each service  restitution of any amounts received for illegally billed claims  and or  exclusion from future participation in the medicare program  which can subject the person or entity to exclusion from future participation in state healthcare programs 
further  if any physician or entity enters into an arrangement or scheme that the physician or entity knows or should have known has the principal purpose of assuring referrals by the physician to a particular entity  and the physician directly makes referrals to such entity  then such physician or entity could be subject to a civil monetary penalty of up to  many states have adopted or are considering similar legislative proposals  some of which extend beyond the medicaid program  to prohibit the payment or receipt of remuneration for the referral of patients and physician self referrals regardless of the source of the payment for the care 
the federal false claims act and similar state laws a factor affecting the healthcare industry today is the use of the federal false claims act  usc et 
seq  and  in particular  actions brought by individuals on behalf of the united states under the qui tam or whistleblower provisions of the false claims act 
whistleblower provisions allow private individuals to bring actions on behalf of the united states alleging that the defendant has defrauded the federal government 
violations of the false claims act are punishable by damages equal to three times the actual damages sustained by the government  plus mandatory civil penalties of between  and  for each separate false claim 
settlements entered prior to litigation usually involve a less severe damages methodology 
there are many potential bases for liability under the false claims act 
liability often arises when an entity knowingly submits a false claim for reimbursement to the federal government 
the false claims act defines the term knowingly broadly 
thus  although simple negligence will not give rise to liability under the false claims act  submitting a claim with reckless disregard for its truth or falsity constitutes a knowing submission under the false claims act and  therefore  will provide grounds for liability 
in some cases whistleblowers or the federal government have taken the position that providers who allegedly have violated other statutes  such as the anti kickback statute and the stark act  likewise thereby have submitted false claims under the false claims act 
a number of states have adopted their own false claims provisions as well as their own whistleblower provisions whereby a private party may file a civil lawsuit in state court on behalf of such state governments 
environmental regulations the healthcare operations of sunlink generate medical waste that must be disposed of in compliance with federal  state and local environmental laws  rules and regulations 
sunlink s operations also are subject to various other environmental laws  rules and regulations 
healthcare facility licensing requirements sunlink s healthcare facilities are subject to extensive federal  state and local legislation and regulations 
in order to maintain their operating licenses  healthcare facilities must comply with strict standards concerning medical care  equipment and hygiene 
various licenses and permits also are required in order to dispense narcotics  operate pharmacies  handle radioactive materials and operate certain equipment 
all licenses  provider numbers and other permits or approvals required to perform hospital business operations are held by individual subsidiaries  each of which operates a single hospital 
all of sunlink s hospitals  except the leased hospital in dexter  missouri  are fully accredited by jcaho 
utilization review compliance and hospital governance sunlink s healthcare facilities are subject to  and comply with  various forms of utilization review 
in addition  under the medicare prospective payment system  each state must have a peer review organization to carry out a federally mandated system of review of medicare patient admissions  treatments and discharges in hospitals 
medical and surgical services and physician practices are supervised extensively by committees of staff doctors at each healthcare facility  are overseen by each healthcare facility s local governing board  the primary voting members of which are physicians and community members  and are reviewed by sunlink s quality assurance personnel 
the local governing boards also help maintain standards for quality care  develop long range plans  establish  review and enforce practices and procedures and approve the credentials and disciplining of medical staff members 
hipaa privacy regulations hipaa provided that if congress did not pass comprehensive health privacy legislation by august   the secretary of hhs was required to issue regulations designed to protect the privacy of individually identifiable health information no later than february  neither congress nor the secretary of hhs met these deadlines  although hhs eventually did publish final privacy regulations on december  the final regulations became effective in april  and compliance was required by april the regulations apply to all documents  paper or electronic  and verbal communications containing individually identifiable protected healthcare information created by healthcare providers  hospitals  health plans and healthcare clearing houses 
the regulations increase consumer control over their medical records  mandate substantial financial penalties for violation of a patient s right to privacy and  with a few exceptions  require that an individual s health information only be used for healthcare related purposes 
the hipaa regulations also require healthcare providers to implement and enforce privacy policies to ensure compliance with the regulations 
on august   hhs published final modifications to the privacy rule regulation 
the final privacy rule contained technical corrections and additional clarifications designed to ensure that protections for patient privacy are implemented in a manner that maximizes privacy while not compromising either the availability or the quality of medical care 
under the direction of sunlink s vice president  technical and compliance and in conjunction with a private hipaa consultant and hipaa coordinators at each facility  individually tailored policies and procedures were developed and implemented and hipaa privacy educational programs were presented to all employees and physicians at every facility prior to the april  deadline 
in addition to the hipaa privacy initiative  various initiatives are underway to address the electronic data interchange edi transaction code standards as well as the security standards which will be effective on october  and april   respectively 
hippa electronic data standards the administrative simplification provisions of hipaa require the use of uniform electronic data transmission standards for all healthcare related electronic data interchange 
these provisions are intended to streamline and encourage electronic commerce in the healthcare industry 
on august   hhs published final regulations establishing electronic data transmission standards that all healthcare providers and payors must use when submitting and receiving certain electronic healthcare transactions 
compliance with these regulations is required by october  we believe that sunlink will be fully compliant with these regulations by the due date and that the cost of implementing systems and procedures to comply with such regulations will not have a significant impact on operations 
when fully implemented  the uniform data transmission standards will enable sunlink to exchange billing and payment information directly with the various payors cutting out the cost of data clearinghouses and simplifying  thus reducing the cost  of the interface programs necessary to perform this function 
professional liability as part of our business  we are subject to claims of liability for events occurring in the ordinary course of hospital operations 
to cover these claims  we maintain professional malpractice liability insurance and general liability insurance in amounts that we believe are sufficient for our operations  although some claims may  exceed the scope or amount of the coverage in effect 
in connection with the acquisition of our initial six community hospitals  sunlink assumed responsibility for general and professional liability claims reported after february  acquisition date  and the previous owner retained responsibility for all known and filed claims 
we have purchased claims made commercial insurance with a substantial self insured retention for coverage prior to and after the acquisition date 
the recorded liability for general and professional liability risks includes an estimate of the liability for claims incurred prior to february   but reported after february  and for claims incurred after february  to the extent of the self insured retention 
discontinued operations and related contingent obligations over the past fifteen years  we have discontinued operations carried on by our former industrial  uk leisure marine  life sciences and engineering and uk child safety segments  as well as the uk housewares segment 
reserves relating to discontinued operations of these segments represent management s best estimate of our possible liability for property  product liability and other claims for which it may incur liability 
these estimates are based on management s judgments using currently available information as well as  in certain instances  consultation with its insurance carriers and legal counsel 
in the past we purchased insurance policies to reduce certain of our product liability exposure 
while we have based these estimates on our evaluation of available information  it is not possible to predict with certainty the ultimate outcome of many contingencies relating to discontinued operations 
we intend to adjust our estimates of the reserves as additional information is developed and evaluated 
however  management believes that the final resolution of these contingencies will not have a material adverse impact on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
employee and labor relations as of june   sunlink employed full time and part time persons in the us  none of whom are represented by a union 
we believe our labor relations generally are satisfactory 
environmental law compliance we believe we are in substantial compliance with applicable federal  state and local environmental regulations 
to date  compliance with federal  state and local laws regulating the discharge of material into the environment or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment have not had a material effect upon our consolidated results of operations  consolidated financial condition or competitive position 
similarly  we have not had to make material capital expenditures to comply with such regulations

corporate business strategy we have redirected our business strategy toward the operation of community hospitals in the united states and  in february   we acquired for approximately  the six community hospitals and related businesses which we currently operate 
on october   we sold all of the capital stock of what was then our wholly owned united kingdom housewares subsidiary  beldray limited  and we no longer own any operating businesses outside the united states 
in august  to reflect the change in our business focus  we changed our name to sunlink health systems  inc  and changed our fiscal year end from march to june critical accounting policies and estimates in january  the sec issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
the following is not intended to be a comprehensive list of all of our accounting policies 
in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  with no need for management s judgment in their application 
there are also areas in which management s judgment in selecting an available alternative would not produce a materially different result 
we have identified the following as accounting policies critical to us management estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
some of the more significant estimates made by management involve reserves for adjustments to net patient service revenues  evaluation of the recoverability of assets  including accounts receivable  and the assessment of litigation and contingencies  including income taxes and related tax asset valuation allowances and risks of losses from claims  casualties and other events  all as discussed in more detail in the remainder of this subsection 
actual results could differ materially from these estimates 
net patient service revenues we have agreements with third party payors that provide for payments at amounts different from established charges 
payment arrangements vary and include prospectively determined rates per discharge  reimbursed costs  discounted charges and per diem payments 
our patient service revenues are reported as services are rendered at the estimated net realizable amounts from patients  third party payors and others 
estimated net realizable amounts are estimated based upon contracts with third party payors  published reimbursement rates and historical reimbursements percentages pertaining to each payor type 
estimated reductions in revenues to reflect agreements with third party payors and estimated retroactive adjustments under such reimbursement agreements are accrued during the period the related services are rendered and are adjusted in future periods as interim and final settlements are determined 
significant changes in reimbursement levels for services under government and private programs could significantly impact the estimates used to accrue such revenue deductions 
at june   there were no material claims or disputes with third party payors 
allowance for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts estimated to become uncollectible in the future 
substantially all of the company s receivables result from providing healthcare services to hospital facility patients 
the company s calculation of the allowance for doubtful accounts is based generally upon our historical collection experience for each type of payor 
the allowance amount is computed by applying allowance percentages to amounts included in specific payor categories of patient accounts receivable 
significant changes in reimbursement levels for services under government and private programs could significantly impact the estimates used to determine the allowance for doubtful accounts 
risk management we are exposed to various risks of loss from medical malpractice and other claims and casualties  theft of  damage to  and destruction of  assets  business interruption  errors and omissions  employee injuries and illnesses  natural disasters including earthquakes  and employee health  dental and accident benefits 
commercial insurance coverage is purchased for a portion of claims arising from such matters 
when  in our judgment  claims are sufficiently identified  we accrue a liability for estimated costs and losses under such claims  net of estimated insurance recoveries 
in connection with the acquisition of our initial six hospitals  we assumed responsibility for professional liability claims reported after the february  acquisition date and the previous owner retained responsibility for all known and filed claims prior to the acquisition date 
we purchased claims made commercial insurance for acts prior to and after the acquisition date 
the recorded liability for professional liability risks includes an estimate of the liability for claims incurred prior to february   but reported after february   and for claims incurred after february  these amounts are based on actuarially determined amounts 
we self insure for workers compensation and employee health risks 
the estimated liability for workers compensation and employee health risks includes estimates of the ultimate costs for both reported claims and claims incurred but not reported 
we accrue an estimate of losses resulting from workers compensation  employee health and professional liability claims to the extent they are not covered by insurance 
these accruals are estimated quarterly based upon management s review of claims reported and historical loss data 
we record a liability pertaining to pending litigation if it is probable a loss has been incurred and accrue the most likely amount of loss based the information available 
if no amount within the range of losses estimated from the information available is more likely than any other amount in the range of loss  the minimum amount in the range of loss is accrued 
because of uncertainties surrounding the nature of litigation and the ultimate liability to us  if any  we continually revise our estimated losses as additional facts become known 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
sfas no 
requires an asset and liability approach and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities for expected future tax consequences 
sfas no 
generally requires consideration of all expected future events other than proposed enactments of changes in the income tax law or rates 
we have provided a valuation allowance for all tax assets so that the net tax asset is zero based on our assessment  using factors identified in sfas no 
 that it is more likely than not that none of the net deferred tax asset will be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies 
at june   the most significant tax asset is a us net operating loss carryforward which expires in and of approximately  utilization of which is subject to the limitations imposed by section of the internal revenue code 
stock based compensation the company measures compensation cost for share options issued to employees using the intrinsic value based method of accounting 
financial summary year ended june  year ended june  three months ended june  year ended march  net revenues cost of patient service revenues operating profit loss merger expenses interest expense interest income earnings loss from continuing operations before income taxes admissions equivalent admissions surgeries revenue per equivalent admissions equivalent admissions equivalent admissions is used by management and investors as a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
equivalent admissions is computed by multiplying admissions inpatient volume by the sum of gross inpatient revenues and gross outpatient revenues and dividing the result by gross inpatient revenues 
the equivalent admissions computation seeks to equate outpatient revenues to the volume measure admissions used to measure inpatient volume to result in a general measure of combined inpatient and outpatient volume 
results of operations all of our net revenues are from our us community hospital segment which was acquired february  as such  net revenues from continuing operations for the twelve months ended june  and  the three months ended june  and the twelve months ended march   respectively  represent only the revenues subsequent to the acquisition date 
therefore  the results for the three months ended june  and year ended march  are not comparable to the years ended june  and  respectively 
the operations of sunlink s two other business segments which were operated during these periods  uk housewares and child safety products  are reported in discontinued operations for all periods discussed 
net revenues for the year ended june  were  with a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  compared to net revenues of  a total of  equivalent admissions and revenues per equivalent admission of  for the year ended june  the increase in net revenues for the year ended june  was due to a increase in equivalent admissions  a increase in revenue per equivalent admission and an increase of  for the settlement and filing of prior year third party payor issues 
net revenues were decreased by during the year ended june  due to a payment in settlement of a medicaid indigent care issue 
the increase in equivalent admissions was a result of a increase in inpatient admissions and an increase in total surgeries 
net outpatient service revenues increased  to  for the current year  but decreased to of net revenues from last year 
recruitment of new doctors and spending for capital improvements have contributed greatly to the increase in net revenues in the current year 
we added net new doctors during the year ended june  and net new doctors during the year ended june  we also have expended approximately  for capital expenditures to upgrade services and facilities since the acquisition on february  in addition  we have expended approximately  for a new replacement hospital in jasper  georgia 
we believe the upgraded services and facilities and the new doctors contributed to the increase in net revenues  admissions  equivalent admissions and surgeries for the year ended june  compared to the prior year 
we continue to seek increased patient volume by attracting additional physicians to our hospitals  further upgrading the services offered by the hospitals and improving the hospitals physical facilities 
the sources of the increase in the net revenues for the current year were primarily revenues from medicare  medicaid and commercial patients while net revenues from private patients were relatively unchanged 
the following table sets forth the percentage of net patient revenues from various payors in the company s hospitals for the periods indicated years ended june  source medicare medicaid self pay commercial insurance other net revenues for the three months ended june  were  with  adjusted admissions and revenues per adjusted admission of  net revenues for the year ended march  were  with a total of  adjusted admissions and revenues per adjusted admission of  cost of patient service revenues  including depreciation  were    and  for the years ended june  and  the three months ended june  and the year ended march   respectively 
cost of patient service revenues as of net revenues year ended june  salaries  wages and benefits provision for bad debts supplies purchased services other operating expenses rent and lease expense salaries  wages and benefits expense decreased in the year ended june  as a percentage of net revenues due to the increased net revenues 
the provision for bad debts was of net revenues in the year ended june   a decrease of of net revenues from the prior year and was due to decreased self pay and commercial payers net revenues and increased medicare and medicaid net revenues as a percentage of total net revenues 
supplies expense increased as a percentage of net revenues in the current year due to an increase in total surgeries for the year ended june  compared to the prior year 
sunlink opened a new hospital in jasper  georgia  in may  replacing an older facility 
during the year ended june   sunlink determined that the carrying value of the older facility and an adjacent medical office building exceeded their estimated fair value by  and  respectively 
an impairment loss of  which is included in cost of patient service revenues was recorded in the year ended june  to write down the hospital and medical office building to fair value 
fair value was determined by sunlink based upon management s determination of the best future use of the facilities and the estimated cash flows generated by these uses 
the medical office building is being retained and continues to be leased to medical practitioners 
the old hospital facility is held for sale 
sunlink expensed previously capitalized costs of during the year ended june  relating to the possible merger with healthmont 
such costs were expensed in the second fiscal quarter of because at that time sunlink could not determine that it was probable that the healthmont merger would be completed 
subsequently  the amended merger agreement was executed and thereafter management believed it was now probable that the merger would be completed  thus no further merger costs have been expensed 
merger costs of were capitalized at june  interest expense was   and for the years ended june  and  the three months ended june  and the year ended march   respectively 
the decrease in fiscal was due to of interest capitalized in property  plant and equipment for the hospital constructed in jasper  georgia and an adjustment of to decrease interest expense as a result of the reduction of the principal amounts of the senior subordinated notes which were issued in connection with the acquisition of sunlink s six initial hospitals in february in december  we reached agreement with the note holder to reduce the principal of the two notes retroactive to february  in settlement of working capital purchased with the acquisition of such hospitals 
we recorded an income tax expense of federal tax and state tax for the year ended june  compared to for the year ended june  for state taxes 
income tax expense of for the year ended march  is composed of for state income taxes and for uk tax expense 
no income tax expense was recorded for the three months ended june  due to tax operating losses in the us and us we had a net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately  at june  use of this net operating loss carryforward is subject to the limitations of the provisions of internal revenue code section as a result  not all of the net operating loss carryforward is available to offset federal taxable income in the current year and federal income tax expense results 
we have provided a valuation allowance for the entire amount of our deferred tax assets the majority of which is the net operating loss carryforward for federal income tax purposes as it is our assessment based upon the criteria identified in sfas no 
that it is currently more likely than not that none of the deferred tax assets will be realized through future taxable earnings or implementation of tax planning strategies 
earnings from continuing operations were per fully diluted share for the year ended june  compared to losses from continuing operations of per fully diluted share  per fully diluted share and per fully diluted share for the year ended june   the three months ended june  and the year ended march  earnings in fiscal resulted from increased net revenues which generated increased operating profit and decreased interest expense 
the loss for year ended june  resulted from operating profit of  offset by interest expense of  and income tax expense of the results for the year ended march  include only two months of operations of our community hospitals 
earnings from discontinued operations of for the year ending june  include the income tax benefit related to a domestic capital loss carry back offset by for domestic pension expense 
earnings from discontinued operations of for the year ended june  is comprised of earnings of on the sale of the uk housewares subsidiary  beldray limited  an after tax loss of from domestic pension expense and a gain on the sale of our investment in lts holdings of the loss from discontinued operations for the three months ended june  of  resulted from loss from operations of beldray of  including an asset impairment provision of  to reduce the carrying value of beldray s net assets to a net realizable value of  a provision for loss on disposal of beldray of  including for operating losses through the disposal date  and an after tax loss of for pension expense 
earnings from discontinued operations of  for the year ended march  resulted from  pre tax gain on the sale of the child safety segment  partially offset by a after tax loss from the pre sale operations of the child safety segment  a after tax loss of the housewares segment and of domestic pension expense 
the net earnings of per fully diluted share for the year ended june  compared to net earnings of per fully diluted share  a net loss of  per fully diluted share and net earnings of per fully diluted share for the year ended june   the three months ended june  and the year ended march  liquidity and capital resources we generated  of cash from operating activities during the year ended june  compared to  generated during the comparable period last year 
cash provided by operations in the current year resulted primarily of net income of increased by the non cash asset impairment charge of  non cash depreciation expense of  non cash interest expense of  and cash generated by increased working capital of  less cash interest paid of sunlink expended  for capital improvements at our hospitals during the year ended june  this excludes included in accounts payable at june  and subsequently paid in july and august in addition to routine capital expenditures of  during the year  primarily for new and replacement equipment  we expended  for the replacement hospital and new equipment in jasper  georgia and  for a new emergency room at north georgia medical center in ellijay  georgia 
we believe attractive  up to date physical facility assists in recruiting quality staff and physicians  as well as attracting patients 
the total cost of the new jasper hospital is approximately  our primary sources of liquidity are cash from continuing operations  borrowing under our credit facilities and a stand by bridge loan facility 
historically  our primary sources of liquidity have included our existing sources as well as borrowings under a term loan entered into at the same time as our revolving credit facility 
our credit facilities include an  secured revolving line of credit facility which matures december  and a  secured bank financing facility for the construction of the jasper replacement hospital 
in addition  the net proceeds from a term loan closed in january  in the amount of  were used for working capital and to fund a portion of our hospital capital projects which included the replacement hospital in jasper  georgia  and the new emergency room in ellijay  georgia 
at june   the term loan balance was the availability of borrowing under the revolving line of credit facility is based upon  among other things  a borrowing base keyed to the level of the hospital s receivables 
based upon sunlink s estimates  the secured line of credit facility provided borrowing capacity of approximately  at june  borrowings under the revolving line of credit at june  were  if the amount or quality of receivables is lower than expected  our borrowing capacity under the secured line of credit facility will also be lower 
on august   sunlink entered into a  standby bridge loan facility with a private investor fund and two sunlink directors one of whom is the chairman and ceo 
the facility has a day commitment period during which the loan could be borrowed 
the facility also has a standby commitment fee which is fully earned and non refundable 
one half of the standby commitment fee is creditable against the closing commitment fee 
a loan commitment fee of of the entire facility is payable upon a draw down of all  or part of the facility 
the  standby bridge loan facility was entered into due to the uncertainty of funding under the revolving line of credit facility after the lender of the revolving line of credit facility experienced financing problems in early august  and subsequently filed for bankruptcy on august  subsequent to their bankruptcy filing  the revolving line of credit lender has funded the line daily by the amount of sunlink s accounts receivable received by the lender to pay down the revolving line of credit 
if sunlink experiences a material adverse change in its business  assets  financial condition  management or operations or the value of the collateral securing the credit facility  we may be unable to draw on the stand by bridge loan facility 
the replacement hospital  mountainside medical center in jasper  georgia  opened in may  on september   sunlink entered into a  secured bank financing facility the mountainside financing facility to provide additional financing for the replacement hospital 
under the mountainside financing facility  sunlink may borrow up to  under a construction loan with interest at prime plus per annum 
at june   sunlink had borrowed  under the mountainside financing facility at june  and it borrowed the remaining  in august we have funded the construction costs for the mountainside replacement hospital with the borrowing under the term loan  the revolving line of credit  the mountainside financing facility and with funds from operations 
the mountainside financing facility may be converted to a year mortgage loan three months after the completion of construction  subject to certain conditions  or on march   if not converted prior to that date 
the year mortgage loan option would bear interest at prime plus per annum or  at sunlink s option  interest at the year us treasury constant maturity yield plus 
the actual mortgage loan interest rate is adjustable every years 
the mountainside financing facility requires sunlink to comply with certain conditions and covenants including hospital financial and operational covenants  information requirements and limitations on secured debt incurred by the hospital subsidiary which owns and operates the jasper  georgia hospital 
the debt capacity of our subsidiary  sunlink healthcare corp 
shc  which owns the stock of the six hospital subsidiaries acquired in february  is limited and is subject to certain leverage tests by its loan agreements 
under the most limiting of such tests  shc would  at june   have been able to incur up to approximately  of additional indebtedness 
contractual obligations related to long term debt  noncancelable operating leases and physician guarantees at june  were as follows contractual obligations  commitments and contingencies payments due in long term debt operating leases physician guarantees year years years years years more than years at june   sunlink had contracts with physicians which contain guaranteed minimum gross receipts 
the table above shows the maximum obligation sunlink has at june  for physician guarantees 
sunlink expenses physician guarantees as they are determined to be due to the physician on an accrual basis 
each month  the physician s gross receipts are accumulated and the difference between the monthly guarantee and the physician s actual gross receipts for the month is calculated 
if the guarantee is greater than the receipts  the difference is accrued as a liability and an expense 
the net guarantee amount is paid to the physician in the succeeding month 
if the physician s monthly receipts exceed the guarantee amount in subsequent months  then the overage is repaid to sunlink to the extent of any prior monthly guarantee payments and the liability and expense is reduced by the amount of the repayment 
during the year ended june   sunlink expensed  of physician guarantees compared to during the year ended june  at june   we had outstanding long term debt of  of which  was incurred in connection with our purchase on february  of our initial six community hospitals and related businesses   was outstanding under the mountainside financing facility   was outstanding under the term loan  was outstanding under our notes due issued to partially fund our loan to healthmont under the amended merger agreement and was related to capital leases 
at such date  our debt included a seller financed balloon note of  and a seller financed zero coupon note of  the purchase agreement for our initial six hospitals provided for an adjustment to the balloon and zero coupon notes to the extent working capital at the purchase date was greater or less than an agreed upon amount 
in december  sunlink and the seller agreed to a working capital settlement that reduced the balloon note by  extended to august  the date that interest payable on the balloon note may be paid in pik notes and reduced the zero coupon note by the balloon note  due january   has a face amount of  and a stated interest rate of which  because it was considered a below market interest rate at the date of issuance  has been discounted for financial reporting purposes to a market interest rate of 
as noted above  the balloon note has a payment in kind pik feature for interest accrued through august  interest due and payable through that date may be paid in additional balloon notes due in and we presently intend to issue pik notes for interest due through august  additional promissory notes have been issued for interest payable from february  to december  totaling  and the interest accrued through june  of has been included in the principal amount of the balloon note 
the zero coupon note is due january   has a face amount of  and has been discounted to a market interest rate of 
the principal amount of the zero coupon note is subject to reduction for certain indemnified items pursuant to the purchase agreement 
additional contingent obligations  other than with respect to our existing operations  include potential product liability claims for products manufactured and sold before the disposal of our discontinued industrial segment in fiscal and for guarantees of certain obligations of former subsidiaries 
we have provided an accrual at june  related to a portion of the guarantee by one of our uk subsidiaries of a lease covering a portion of a manufacturing facility utilized by our former uk housewares subsidiary 
the guarantee runs through march the maximum potential obligation of sunlink under the guarantee would be  one of sunlink s uk subsidiaries has an option to repurchase the capital stock of the former housewares subsidiary for nominal consideration if any uk subsidiary of sunlink is called upon to perform under the lease guarantee  or under certain other conditions 
we are currently in the process of liquidating two dormant subsidiaries in germany and france 
based upon an evaluation of information currently available and consultation with legal counsel  management has not reserved any amounts for contingencies related to these liquidations 
we believe we have adequate financing and liquidity to support our current level of operations through the next twelve months 
as noted above  our current sources of liquidity are availability under our  revolving credit facility  remaining availability of  under our mountainside financing facility related to the hospital being constructed in jasper  georgia  the  stand by bridge loan and cash generated from our community hospital operations 
availability under the revolving credit facility is based upon the level of our receivables 
the current availability at june  of approximately  could be adversely affected by  among other things  decreases in hospitals receivables due to lower demand for our services by patients  change in patient mix and changes in terms and levels of government and private reimbursement for services 
subsequent to their bankruptcy filing  the revolving line of credit lender has funded the line daily by the amount of sunlink s accounts receivable received by the lender to pay down the revolving line of credit 
cash generated from operations could be adversely affected by  among other things  lower patient demand for our services  higher operating costs including  but not limited to  salaries  wages and benefits  provisions for bad debts  general liability and other insurance costs  cost of pharmaceutical drugs and other operating expenses  changes in terms and levels of government and private reimbursement for services and the regulatory environment of the community hospital segment 
impact of potential acquisition of healthmont on liquidity and capital resources if we complete the proposed acquisition of healthmont  we expect to assume approximately  in healthmont senior debt 
subject to a number of conditions  healthmont has obtained the consent of its senior lender to our proposed merger of healthmont and the modification of certain terms of healthmont s senior credit facility  which include a principal repayment of at the closing of the merger and an extension of the maturity date of the remaining debt to august  certain healthmont investors have arranged letters of credit which support up to  of healthmont s revolving credit loans 
subject to completion of the merger  we have agreed that if the merger is completed and  in the event the letters of credit are drawn and the proceeds are used to reduce the outstanding balance of the revolving credit loans  we will issue to such letter of credit obligors up to  of sunlink common shares in full satisfaction of healthmont s reimbursement obligations under the letters of credit 
in connection with the proposed merger of healthmont  we expect to borrow up to  from a private lender with such borrowings with a three year term secured by the stock and assets of healthmont 
such borrowings were partially funded in march in connection with the amended merger agreement with healthmont through the purchase of of our notes due by such private lender 
the proceeds from the sale of such notes was used to partially fund our loan commitment to healthmont of up to  of which  had been borrowed at june  the loan to healthmont was used to repay of healthmont s senior debt in march and will be used to pay accounts payable 
the  year secured term borrowing will be used for working capital and certain merger transaction costs  will bear interest at per annum and requires sunlink to pay certain fees and issue warrants to the lender to purchase  sunlink common shares at per share 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no
