item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this item contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties and actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in such statements as a result of various factors including those described below in risks relating to our business 
overview the following is a discussion and analysis of certain factors that have affected our results of operations and financial condition during the periods included in the accompanying financial statements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and associated notes 
acquisitions in february  we acquired micro robotics systems  inc mrsi  a manufacturer of high precision  fully automated assembly and dispensing systems  for  shares of our common stock including  shares issuable upon the exercise of assumed stock options and million in cash 
assets acquired in connection with this transaction included cash of approximately million 
the transaction was accounted for using the purchase method 
the acquisition expands our product offerings and technological capability for back end packaging applications in the semiconductor  microwave communications  and fiber optic communications markets 
in august  we acquired unique equipment co 
unique  a systems integrator specializing in robotics and automation 
in february  we acquired kensington laboratories  inc kli  a manufacturer of high precision robotic and motion control equipment primarily for the semiconductor industry 
we issued approximately  shares of common stock to the kli shareholders in the transaction 
also in february  we acquired design technology corporation dtc  a systems integrator specializing in the use of robotics and flexible automation solutions for manufacturing processes 
the dtc acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method 
the unique and kli acquisitions were accounted for using the pooling of interests method 
this discussion includes the effects of the acquisitions of unique and kli for all years presented and the effects of the acquisitions of mrsi and dtc from their dates of acquisition 
divestitures during march  to more efficiently deploy our resources to those areas that are critical to product development efforts for our strategic markets  our board of directors approved management s plan to sell our industrial metrology systems division imsd  including the business of cejohansson ab  a sweden based global supplier of advanced metrology systems that we acquired in december the imsd division consists of three businesses the contact measurement business  the non contact metrology business and the measurement and calibration business 
the contact measurement and non contact metrology businesses were sold in for cash of approximately million 
during august  to increase the efficiency of our product development and manufacturing efforts  our board of directors approved management s plan to sell our facility in plymouth  minnesota  which manufactures high precision motion stages for the semiconductor equipment  computer peripheral  fiber optic communications and life and health sciences markets and is part of our industrial and scientific technologies division 
in the first quarter of  due to the weak response from potential buyers  we decided to shut down the facility and liquidate the majority of the remaining assets 
we expect to complete the shutdown by april 
table of contents both of these divestitures have been accounted for as discontinued operations pursuant to financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and  accordingly  all prior periods presented have been adjusted to reflect the financial results of these operations as discontinued operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates and assumptions  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  warranty obligations  restructuring reserves  asset impairment valuations and income tax valuations 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other factors which we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
these estimates and assumptions by their nature involve risks and uncertainties  and may prove to be inaccurate 
in the event that any of our estimates or assumptions are inaccurate in any material respect  it could have a material adverse effect on our reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record a sale after all significant obligations have been met  collectibility is probable and title has passed  which typically occurs upon shipment or completion of services 
customers generally have days from the original invoice date generally days for international customers to return a standard catalog product purchase for exchange or credit 
the catalog product must be returned in its original condition and meet certain other criteria 
product returns of catalog items have historically been insignificant and are charged against revenue in the period returned 
custom  option configured and certain other products as defined in our terms and conditions of sale cannot be returned 
accounts receivable 
we estimate the collectibility of customer receivables on an ongoing basis by periodically reviewing invoices outstanding over a certain period of time 
we have recorded reserves for receivables deemed to be at risk for collection  as well as a general reserve based on our historical collections experience 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables  including the current credit worthiness of each customer 
in recent periods we have increased our reserves for uncollectible accounts due to adverse changes in the financial condition of certain of our customers in the fiber optic communications market 
if the financial conditions of our customers in this market continue to deteriorate  or if the financial conditions of our customers in the semiconductor and other markets we serve begin to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  additional allowances may be required which could adversely affect our operating results 
inventory 
we state our inventories at the lower of cost  determined on either a first in  first out fifo or average cost basis  or market and provide reserves for potentially excess and obsolete inventory 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with the current or committed inventory levels 
reserves are established for inventory levels that exceed expected future demand 
we have recorded significant reserves  primarily for excess inventory  in recent periods due to deterioration in our primary target markets  fiber optic communications and semiconductor capital equipment 
it is possible that additional changes in required inventory reserves may occur in the future due to changes in market conditions 

table of contents warranty 
unless otherwise stated in our product literature  we provide a one year warranty from the original invoice date on all product material and workmanship 
products sold to certain original equipment manufacturer customers sometimes carry longer warranties 
defective products will be either repaired or replaced  generally at our option  upon meeting certain criteria 
we accrue a provision for the estimated costs that may be incurred for product warranties relating to a product as a component of cost of sales at the time revenue for that product is recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
should actual product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty obligation would be required which could adversely affect our operating results 
impairment of assets and restructuring reserves 
we assess the impairment of long lived assets  other than goodwill  whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
the determination of related estimated useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgments  related primarily to the future profitability and or future value of the assets 
changes in our strategic plan and or market conditions could significantly impact these judgments and could require adjustments to recorded asset balances 
we hold minority interests in companies having operations or technologies in areas within or adjacent to our strategic focus  all of which are privately held and whose values are difficult to determine 
we record an investment impairment charge in any reporting period where we believe an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
in  two fiber optic component manufacturers in which we had made minority investments in prior years experienced severe financial difficulties 
one manufacturer shut down its business and liquidated its assets  and the other manufacturer filed for bankruptcy protection 
as a result  we recorded an asset write down of million in relating to these investments 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
in  the fasb issued statement no 
 business combinations statement  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement  which we adopted on january  under statement  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to impairment tests based upon a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units  as defined  and the carrying value of the reporting units net assets  including goodwill 
pursuant to statement  upon adoption we tested our goodwill for impairment and recorded an impairment charge  based upon an independent valuation  of million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle as of january  statement requires a review for impairment at least annually or when circumstances exist that would indicate an impairment of such goodwill 
we perform the annual impairment review as of october each year 
the october annual review resulted in no additional impairment of the carrying value of goodwill 
at december   we had goodwill of approximately million 
had we not amortized goodwill  our net loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  would have decreased million and our net income from continuing operations for the year ended december  would have increased million 
during and  we recorded significant reserves in connection with our restructuring and cost reduction programs 
these reserves include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and facility closure costs 
although we do not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs to settle such liabilities may differ from the amounts estimated 
deferred taxes 
we currently have significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
we recorded a valuation reserve in the third quarter of against our deferred tax assets pursuant to fasb statement no 
 accounting for income taxes statement  due to the uncertainty as to the timing and ultimate realization of those assets 
as such  we did not recognize any tax benefit on the losses recorded in and recorded a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets previously recorded 
for the foreseeable future  the tax provision related to earnings will be substantially offset by a 
table of contents reduction in the valuation reserve  and any future pretax losses will not be offset by a tax benefit due to the uncertainty of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset 
realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon our achievement of future taxable income  the estimation of which requires significant management judgment 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to many factors  including future market conditions and our ability to successfully execute our business plans 
these changes  if any  may require material adjustments to these deferred tax asset balances 
restructuring and impairment charges restructuring plan in august  in response to the continued protracted downturn in the fiber optic communications market and the uncertainty with respect to the pace of recovery in the semiconductor equipment market  our board of directors approved management s cost reduction plan to bring our operating costs in line with our business outlook at that time 
facility consolidations as part of this cost reduction plan  we closed our santa ana  california fiber optics facility and consolidated those operations into our irvine  california facility 
in addition  we completed the closure of our san luis obispo  california facility and the consolidation of our former design technology facility in billerica  massachusetts into our mrsi facility  in north billerica  massachusetts 
restructuring and impairment charges for the year ended december  included million for these facility consolidations 
in addition  selling  general and administrative expenses for included million of costs related to the closing of these facilities and the completion of the consolidation of our garden grove  california facility into our irvine  california facility 
employee severance the cost reduction plan included a workforce reduction of approximately employees  of which had been terminated as of december  approximately one half of the workforce reduction results from combining our automation businesses into the new advanced packaging and automation systems apas division and reducing the scope of our investment in the fiber optic communications market 
approximately one quarter of the reduction results from the divestiture of our discontinued operations  and the remaining reductions result from further streamlining of our operations 
restructuring and impairment charges for the year ended december  included million for employee severance and related termination costs 
inventory reserves as part of the cost reduction plan  we rationalized certain legacy products and discontinued certain product development initiatives 
in addition  due to the reduced sales forecasts  we increased our reserves for slow moving inventory by million  which is included in cost of sales for the year ended december  in addition  we established a reserve of million for consignment and demonstration inventory that we deemed to be obsolete or slow moving  which is included in selling  general and administrative expenses for

for  and  our net sales totaled million  million and million  respectively 
net sales for decreased million  or  compared with the decrease in net sales was principally attributable to the significant downturns that continue to impact the fiber optic communications and semiconductor equipment markets  offset in part by a slight increase in sales to the aerospace and research markets 
net sales for increased million  or  compared with  due primarily to sales increases to the semiconductor equipment market  offset in part by a decline in sales to the fiber optic communications market 
sales to the semiconductor equipment market were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
sales to this market in decreased million  or  compared with  reflecting weakness in demand by semiconductor manufacturers for capital equipment  which led to a significant reduction in demand for the components  subsystems and robots we sell to this market 
in  sales to this market increased million  or  compared with the sales increase in compared with reflected the strong demand by semiconductor manufacturers for capital equipment through the second quarter of  offset in part by a substantial decline in this market during the second half of sales to the research and aerospace  life and health sciences and related industrial markets were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
sales to these markets in decreased million  or  compared with sales to research and aerospace customers during were higher compared with  but this increase was offset by a significant reduction in sales to industrial customers supporting the telecommunications industry 
in  sales to this market increased million  or  compared with  due primarily to increased sales to industrial customers supporting the telecommunications industry 
sales to the fiber optic communications market were million  million and million for  and  respectively 
sales to this market in decreased million  or  compared with  reflecting the continued severe market downturn in capital spending in this market 
sales to this 
table of contents market in decreased million  or  compared with  as we began experiencing weak market demand during the second half of for  and  domestic sales were million  million and million  respectively 
domestic sales in decreased million  or  compared with  due to sales decreases in the fiber optic communications  semiconductor equipment and other markets of million  or  million  or  and million  or  respectively 
domestic sales in increased million  or  compared with  due primarily to sales increases in the semiconductor equipment and other markets of million  or  and million  or  respectively  offset in part by a decline in sales to the fiber optic communications market of million  or 
international sales totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
for  international sales decreased million  or  compared with  due primarily to decreases in the fiber optic communications market and the research and aerospace  life and health sciences and related industrial markets of million  or  and million  or  respectively 
geographically  the decrease in sales compared with was driven by reductions in sales of million  or  to european customers  million  or  to pacific rim customers  million  or  to canadian customers  and million  or  to other international customers 
the increase in international sales in compared with of million  or  was due primarily to increases in the fiber optic communications market and the research and aerospace  life and health sciences and related industrial markets of million  or  and million  or  respectively 
this increase was offset in part by a decrease in international sales to the semiconductor equipment market of million or 
geographically  the increase in sales compared with was driven primarily by sales to european and other international customers of million  or and million or  respectively  offset in part by lower sales to canadian and pacific rim customers of million  or and million  or  respectively 
our business is subject to risks arising from market conditions in the semiconductor equipment and fiber optic communications markets  as well as from general economic conditions 
during the second half of  the semiconductor equipment and fiber optic communications markets experienced severe downturns 
additionally  the general economic recession constrained capital spending in many of our end markets 
the downturn in the fiber optic communications market continued and worsened in  and we expect orders from and sales to this market to remain depressed through and into the semiconductor equipment market recovered slightly in the second and third quarters of  but that recovery stalled  and we expect the recovery in this market to be delayed until later in the precise timing and extent of any recovery from these conditions in the semiconductor equipment and fiber optic communications markets is difficult to predict and represents a significant uncertainty with respect to our future operating results 
we expect that our sales to the aerospace and defense and research markets will fluctuate from period to period in line with changes in overall research and defense spending levels  but will show a long term growth trend in line with growth in the united states gross domestic product 
gross margin 
gross margin was  and for  and  respectively 
the reductions in gross margin for and resulted primarily from charges recorded in the third quarter of each year of million and million  respectively  for excess inventory related primarily to continued weakness in the telecommunications industry 
see restructuring and impairment charges on pages 
excluding these charges  gross margin would have been in and in the reduction in gross margin for also resulted from significantly lower sales volume and lower fixed overhead absorption in  offset in part by lower sales to oem customers 
the decrease in gross margin in compared with was due primarily to the charge described above  as well as to lower absorption of fixed overhead caused by the sharp decline in sales volume through the second half of generally  we expect that our gross margin will fluctuate in future periods due to factors including absorption of fixed overhead due to sales volumes and production activity  product mix and the proportion of 
table of contents sales to oem customers  material costs  changes in the carrying value of inventory and manufacturing efficiencies 
because a significant portion of our manufacturing overhead is fixed in the short term  the impact of increases or decreases in sales on our gross margin will likely not be in proportion to the changes in sales 
selling  general and administrative sg a expense 
sg a expense totaled million  or of net sales  million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  for  and  respectively 
sg a expense for included expenses in the third quarter of million for costs incurred in connection with our cost reduction initiatives 
excluding these charges  sg a expense for would have been million  or of sales 
the expense decrease on a year over year basis resulted from lower variable expenses related to the lower sales volume and from the benefits of our cost reduction measures  offset in part by the addition of sg a expenses relating to our mrsi subsidiary  acquired in february  for which there was no comparable expense in the periods 
sg a expense for and included million and million  respectively  for amortization of goodwill 
pursuant to fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  beginning in  goodwill is no longer required to be amortized  but instead is subject to periodic impairment testing 
sg a expenses in increased million  or  compared with  primarily due to costs of the additional infrastructure added to be able to support the sales growth forecasted in late and early  offset in part by the effects of the cost reduction efforts initiated in the second half of in response to the downturn in our primary end markets 
we expect that sg a as a percentage of sales will fluctuate in the future based on our sales level in any given period 
because a significant portion of our sg a expenses are fixed in the short term  these fluctuations will likely not be in proportion to the change in sales 
research and development r d expense 
r d expense totaled million  or of net sales  million  or of net sales  and million  or of net sales  for  and  respectively 
r d expense decreased million  or  in compared with due primarily to our efforts to maximize the focus and efficiency of our r d efforts  offset by additional r d spending related to mrsi  for which there was no comparable expense in r d expense increased million  or  in compared with due primarily to increased personnel costs related to the development of a number of new products and product enhancements  primarily in our apas division 
we believe that the continued development and advancement of our key products and technologies is critical to our future success 
accordingly  we intend to continue to invest in key r d initiatives  while working to ensure that the efforts are focused and the funds are deployed efficiently 
we expect that r d expense as a percentage of sales will fluctuate in the future based on our sales level in any given period 
because of our commitment to continued product development  and because a significant portion of our r d expense are fixed in the short term  these fluctuations will likely not be in proportion to the change in sales 
restructuring and impairment charges 
restructuring and impairment charges related to the cost reduction and related initiatives discussed previously totaled million for and million in acquisition and other non recurring charges 
during the first quarter of  we recorded acquisition and other non recurring charges of million 
these charges were comprised of million for investment banking  legal and accounting fees related to our acquisition of kli and a charge of million related to the acceleration of stock options held by a retiring executive officer 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net of interest expense  totaled million  million and million for  and  respectively 
the decrease in from was due primarily to realized losses on foreign exchange transactions and reduced interest rate levels during in the third quarter of  we completed a secondary public offering for which we received proceeds of million after underwriting discounts and commissions 
the increase in compared with was primarily attributable to income from the investment of the proceeds from the secondary offering for the full year 
table of contents we expect that interest income will fluctuate in future periods based on cash balances and changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
asset write down 
two fiber optic component manufacturers in which we had made minority investments in prior years experienced severe financial difficulties during one manufacturer has shut down its operations and liquidated its assets and the second manufacturer filed for bankruptcy protection 
as a result  we wrote down these investments to their estimated fair value  resulting in a charge of million during income taxes 
our effective tax rates from continuing operations were  and for  and  respectively 
the tax expense resulted from a valuation allowance that was recorded against a portion of our deferred tax assets pursuant to statement  due to the uncertainty as to the timing and ultimate realization of those assets 
as such  we did not recognize any tax benefit on the losses recorded in the current period and recorded a million valuation allowance against deferred tax assets previously recorded 
for the foreseeable future  the tax provision related to earnings will be substantially offset by a reduction in the valuation reserve  and any future pretax losses will not be offset by a tax benefit due to uncertainty of the recoverability of the deferred tax asset 
the increase in our effective tax rate in compared with was due primarily to the earnings attributable to our acquisition of kli  which was accounted for as a pooling of interests 
prior to its acquisition  kli was treated as an s corporation for us tax purposes and accordingly  recorded no income tax provision 
assuming that kli had been taxed as a c corporation for all periods presented  our effective tax rate in would have been liquidity and capital resources despite our net loss of million  our operating activities in provided cash of million 
cash provided by operations was primarily attributable to a decrease in other current assets of million and collections of customer receivables of million  offset in part by a decrease in accounts payable and accrued expenses of million 
net cash provided by investing activities of million for was primarily attributable to net sales of marketable securities of million and the proceeds from the sale of businesses of million  partially offset by purchases of property  plant and equipment million and net cash paid and cash expenses relating to our acquisitions of mrsi million and certain intellectual property rights million 
net cash used in financing activities in of million was primarily attributable to payments on long term borrowings of million  offset in part by the sales of common stock in connection with stock option exercises and employee stock purchase plans  which generated million in proceeds and resulted in the issuance of approximately  shares of common stock 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of million 
substantially all of our marketable securities are divided into three portfolios  each managed by a professional investment management firm  under the oversight of the investment committee of our board of directors and members of our senior management team 
such portfolio managers invest the funds allocated to them in accordance with our investment policy  which is reviewed regularly by the investment committee and our senior financial management 
we expect that our portfolio balances will fluctuate in the future based on factors such as cash used in or provided by ongoing operations  acquisitions or divestitures  investments in other companies  capital expenditures and contractual obligations  as well as changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
at december   we had in place a credit agreement for a million unsecured line of credit expiring september  certain of the marketable securities that are being managed by the lending institution collateralize the line of credit 
the line bears interest at the prevailing prime rate  or the prevailing 
table of contents london interbank offered rate plus  at our option  plus an unused line fee of per year 
at december   there were no balances outstanding under the line of credit  with million available under the line  after considering outstanding letters of credit totaling million 
at december   we had million outstanding under a long term debt agreement with an insurance company 
these unsecured senior notes  sold at par  carry an annual coupon and mature in may principal and interest are payable semiannually 
at december   we were not in compliance with a covenant under this agreement due to the net loss and the restructuring and impairment charges recorded in the insurance company has waived this noncompliance through december  and has amended the debt agreement effective december  to delete this covenant 
we believe we will be in compliance with our other debt covenants on an ongoing basis 
we lease certain of our manufacturing and office facilities and equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
contractual obligations at december  are summarized as follows in thousands payments due by period total and beyond operating lease obligations principal payments on long term debt we believe our current working capital position together with estimated cash flows from operations and existing credit availability are adequate to fund operations in the ordinary course of business  anticipated capital expenditures  debt payment requirements and other contractual obligations  for the foreseeable future 
however  this belief is based upon many assumptions and is subject to numerous risks see risks relating to our business  on pages  and there can be no assurance that we will not require additional funding in the future 
although we have no present agreements or commitments with respect to any material acquisitions of other businesses  products  product rights or technologies  we continue to evaluate acquisitions of and or investments in products  technologies or companies that complement our business and may make such acquisitions in the future 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that we will not need to obtain additional sources of capital in the future to finance any such acquisitions 
new accounting standards in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin  effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for periods ending after december  under fin  a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of certain guarantees  a fair value liability for the obligations it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee  including its ongoing obligation to stand ready to perform over the term of the guarantee in the event that the specified triggering events or conditions occur 
fin clarifies that a guarantor is required to disclose a the nature of the guarantee  including the term and circumstances giving rise to the guarantee  b the maximum potential amount of future payments under the guarantee  c the carrying amount of the liability  if any  for the guarantor s obligation under the guarantee  and d the nature and extent of any recourse or collateral provisions 
all guarantees subject to the disclosure provisions of fin  such as product warranties  have been disclosed in the notes to the consolidated financial 
table of contents statements included in this annual report on form k 
we do not have any other outstanding guarantees at december  that would be required to be disclosed or recorded as obligations upon adoption of fin on january   we adopted fasb statement no 
 business combinations statement 
statement eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations and changed the criteria to recognize intangible assets apart from goodwill 
we accounted for the acquisition of mrsi in accordance with the provisions of statement on january   we adopted fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement 
under statement  goodwill is no longer amortized but is subject to impairment tests based upon a comparison of the fair value of each of our reporting units  as defined  and the carrying value of the reporting units net assets  including goodwill 
pursuant to statement  upon adoption we tested our goodwill for impairment and recorded an impairment charge of million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle on january  statement requires a review for impairment at least annually or when circumstances exist that would indicate an impairment of such goodwill 
we perform the annual impairment review as of october of each year 
the october annual review indicated no further impairment of the carrying value of our goodwill 
at december   we had goodwill of approximately million 
had we not amortized goodwill  our net loss from continuing operations for the year ended december  would have decreased million and our net income from continuing operations for the year ended december  would have increased million 
on january   we adopted fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement 
under statement  long lived assets  other than goodwill  are evaluated for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
in addition  assets held for sale are included in discontinued operations if the operations and cash flows will be or have been eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity and the entity will not have any significant continuing involvement in the operations of the component 
the discontinuances of our industrial metrology systems division and our plymouth  minnesota facility have been accounted for as discontinued operations under the provisions of statement in july  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities statement 
statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
statement is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  because our cost reduction and other initiatives occurred prior to december   they have been accounted for under eitf  and the associated cost has been recognized as of the date of the board of directors approval of management s cost reduction plan 
if any restructuring activities are undertaken in future years  they will be accounted for under statement in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure statement  providing alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  statement amends the disclosure requirements to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we do not currently plan to change our stock based employee compensation accounting to the fair value method 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements reflect all of the disclosures required by statement 
table of contents risks relating to our business our operating results are difficult to predict  and if we fail to meet the expectations of investors and or securities analysts  the market price of our common stock will likely decline significantly 
our operating results in any given quarter have fluctuated and will likely continue to fluctuate 
these fluctuations are typically unpredictable and can result from numerous factors including fluctuations in our customers capital spending  industry cyclicality and other economic conditions within the markets we serve  demand for our products and the products sold by our customers  the level of orders within a given quarter and preceding quarters  the timing and level of cancellations and delays of orders for our products  the timing of product shipments within a given quarter  our timing in introducing new products  variations in the mix of products we sell in each of the markets in which we do business  changes in our pricing policies or in the pricing policies of our competitors or suppliers  market acceptance of any new or enhanced versions of our products  the availability and cost of key components and raw materials we use to manufacture our products  our ability to manufacture a sufficient quantity of our products to meet customer demand  fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  timing of new product introductions by our competitors  and our levels of expenses 
we may in the future choose to reduce prices  increase spending  or add or eliminate products in response to actions by competitors or in an effort to pursue new market opportunities 
these actions may also adversely affect our business and operating results and may cause our quarterly results to be lower than the results of previous quarters 
we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of results from operations  or any other similar period to period comparisons  should not be construed as reliable indicators of our future performance 
in any period  our results may be below the expectations of market analysts and investors  which would likely cause the trading price of our common stock to drop 
we are highly dependent on the semiconductor industry and on our customers who serve this volatile and unpredictable industry 
a substantial portion of our current and expected future business comes from sales of subsystem products to manufacturers of semiconductor fabrication and metrology equipment and sales of capital equipment to integrated semiconductor device manufacturers 
the semiconductor market has historically been characterized by sudden and severe cyclical variations in product supply and demand 
the timing  severity and duration of these market cycles are difficult to predict  and we may not be able to respond effectively to these cycles 
the continuing uncertainty in this market severely limits our ability to predict our business prospects or financial results in this market 
during industry downturns  our revenues from this market may decline suddenly and significantly 
our ability to rapidly and effectively reduce our cost structure in response to such downturns is limited by the fixed nature of many of our expenses in the near term and by our need to continue our investment in next generation product technology and to support and service our products 
in addition  due to the relatively long manufacturing 
table of contents lead times for some of the systems and subsystems we sell to this market  we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell 
accordingly  downturns in the semiconductor capital equipment market may materially harm our operating results 
conversely  when upturns in this market occur  we must be able to rapidly and effectively increase our manufacturing capacity to meet increases in customer demand that may be extremely rapid  and if we fail to do so we may lose business to our competitors and our relationships with our customers may be harmed 
the semiconductor capital equipment market is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent product introductions  changing customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
because our customers face uncertainties with regard to the growth and requirements of these markets  their products and components may not achieve  or continue to achieve  anticipated levels of market acceptance 
if our customers are unable to deliver products that gain market acceptance  it is likely that these customers will not purchase our products or will purchase smaller quantities of our products 
we often invest substantial resources in developing our systems and subsystems in advance of significant sales of these systems and or subsystems to such customers 
a failure on the part of our subsystem customers products to gain market acceptance  or a failure of the semiconductor capital equipment market to grow would have a significant negative effect on our business and results of operations 
we rely on a limited number of customers for a significant portion of our sales to the semiconductor capital equipment market 
our top five customers in this market comprised approximately and of our sales to this market in the fiscal year ended december  and  respectively  and our top two customers accounted for approximately and  respectively  of our sales to this market in these periods 
in  one customer in this market  applied materials  inc  comprised of our consolidated net sales for the year 
if any of our principal customers discontinues its relationship with us  replaces us as a subsystem vendor for certain products or suffers downturns in its business  our business and results of operations could be harmed significantly 
in addition  because a relatively small number of semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers dominate this market  it may be particularly difficult for us to replace our customers if we lose their business 
a significant portion of our expected future subsystem business in the semiconductor capital equipment market is comprised of products for the fabrication of mm semiconductor wafers 
wafer fabrication equipment for mm wafers is in a very early stage of its adoption  and is expected to be driven by the need for the ability to manufacture more semiconductor chips at lower cost 
the deployment of such equipment requires a significant capital investment by semiconductor manufacturers  and many semiconductor manufacturers have delayed plans to deploy such equipment until market conditions improve 
if the demand for capital equipment for mm wafers does not increase  or increases more slowly than expected  demand for our subsystem products will likewise be adversely affected  and our business and results of operations could be harmed significantly 
in addition  a significant portion of our expected future capital equipment sales to the integrated semiconductor device manufacturing market is comprised of systems for flip chip bonding and other advanced die bonding techniques 
demand for these systems is expected to be driven in significant part by increases in demand for new technologies in industries such as communications and consumer electronics that require the use of such manufacturing techniques 
if the demand for electronic devices requiring flip chip bonding and or other advanced die bonding techniques does not increase  or increases more slowly than expected  demand for our capital equipment will likewise be adversely affected  and our business and results of operations could be harmed significantly 
many of the markets and industries that we serve are subject to rapid technological change  and if we do not introduce new and innovative products or improve our existing products  our business and results of operations will be negatively affected 
many of our markets are characterized by rapid technological advances  evolving industry standards  shifting customer needs and new product introductions and enhancements 
products in our markets often become 
table of contents outdated quickly and without warning 
we depend to a significant extent upon our ability to enhance our existing products  to address the demands of the marketplace for new and improved technology  either through internal development or by acquisitions  and to be price competitive 
if we or our competitors introduce new or enhanced products  it may cause our customers to defer or cancel orders for our existing products 
in addition  because certain of our markets experience severe cyclicality in capital spending  if we fail to introduce new products in a timely manner we may miss market upturns  and may fail to have our subsystem products designed into our customers products 
we may not be successful in acquiring  developing  manufacturing or marketing new products on a timely or cost effective basis 
if we fail to adequately introduce new  competitive products on a timely basis  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
we offer products for multiple industries and must face the challenges of supporting the distinct needs of each of the markets we serve 
we market products for the semiconductor capital equipment  aerospace and defense  life and health sciences  scientific research and fiber optic communications markets 
because we operate in multiple markets  we must work constantly to understand the needs  standards and technical requirements of several different industries and must devote significant resources to developing different products for these industries 
product development is costly and time consuming 
many of our products are used by our customers to develop  manufacture and test their own products 
as a result  we must anticipate trends in our customers industries and develop products before our customers products are commercialized 
if we do not accurately predict our customers needs and future activities  we may invest substantial resources in developing products that do not achieve broad market acceptance 
our decision to continue to offer products to a given market or to penetrate new markets is based in part on our judgment of the size  growth rate and other factors that contribute to the attractiveness of a particular market 
if our product offerings in any particular market are not competitive or our analyses of a market are incorrect  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
because the sales cycle for some of our products is long and difficult to predict  and certain of our orders are subject to rescheduling or cancellation  we may experience fluctuations in our operating results 
many of our capital equipment and subsystem products are complex  and customers for these products require substantial time to make purchase decisions 
these customers often perform  or require us to perform extensive configuration  testing and evaluation of our products before committing to purchasing them 
the sales cycle for our capital equipment and subsystem products from initial contact through shipment typically varies  is difficult to predict and can last as long as one year 
the orders comprising our backlog are often subject to cancellation and changes in delivery schedules by our customers without significant penalty 
we have from time to time experienced order rescheduling and cancellations that have caused our revenues in a given period to be materially less than would have been expected based on our backlog at the beginning of the period 
if we experience such rescheduling and or cancellations in the future  our operating results will fluctuate from period to period 
these fluctuations could harm our results of operations and cause our stock price to drop 
the severe downturn in the fiber optic communications market has harmed and may continue to harm our business 
our sales to the fiber optic communications market are largely dependent upon sales to companies that manufacture components for fiber optic communications systems 
these component manufacturers are largely dependent upon telecommunications system manufacturers  who in turn depend on sales of their products to telecommunications carriers 
as such  our success in this market will ultimately depend on the long term growth of the communications industry  and in particular the growth of internet usage and bandwidth demand 
demand for high bandwidth service has not grown as quickly as the communications industry had forecast  and many carriers currently have significant excess capacity in their fiber optic networks 
as a result  demand for optical components has decreased substantially  leaving many component manufacturers with significant excess manufacturing capacity 
unless and until higher demand for bandwidth increases network utilization and 
table of contents bandwidth pricing  telecommunications carriers will be unlikely to make significant investments in new fiber optic networks  and sales of the manufacturing and test equipment we supply to the companies that build this network equipment will be unlikely to increase significantly 
in addition  several major telecommunications carriers have recently declared bankruptcy or are in significant financial distress  and others have significant debt service obligations that may limit their ability to purchase new network equipment  which may further delay the recovery of this market 
due to the decline in demand for optical components and our customers significant excess manufacturing capacity  our sales to this market have declined substantially  and may decline further in the future 
while we have significantly reduced the cost structure of our operations serving this market  our ability to reduce these costs further is limited by our plans to continue our investment in certain critical next generation product technology and to support and service our products 
in addition  due to the relatively long manufacturing lead times for some of the systems and subsystems we sell to these markets  we may incur expenditures or purchase raw materials or components for products we cannot sell 
we have in the past and may in the future be required to write off excess or obsolete inventory due to declines in our forecasted sales to this market 
our component manufacturer customers have experienced severe business declines during this downturn 
several of these customers have recently ceased operations or announced their intent to exit this market 
others are currently operating at losses and are unable to make meaningful long term predictions for their recovery  and hence their forecasted requirements for capital equipment 
this continuing uncertainty severely limits our ability to predict the timing of any recovery in this market or our sales to this market in future periods 
we face significant risks from doing business in foreign countries 
our business is subject to risks inherent in conducting business internationally 
in  and  our international revenues accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of total net sales  with a substantial portion of sales originating in europe 
we expect that international revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of total net sales for the foreseeable future 
as a result of our international operations  we face various risks  which include adverse changes in the political or economic conditions in countries or regions where we manufacture or sell our products  challenges of administering our business globally  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements including export requirements  tariffs and other trade barriers  longer accounts receivable collection periods  overlapping  differing or more burdensome tax structures  adverse currency fluctuations  differing protection of intellectual property  difficulties in staffing and managing each of our individual foreign operations  and trade restrictions and licensing requirements 
as a result of our international operations  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates could affect the sales price in local currencies of our products in foreign markets  potentially making our products less competitive 
in addition  exchange rate fluctuations could increase the costs and expenses of our foreign operations or require us to modify our current business practices 
if we experience any of the risks associated with international business  our business and results of operations could be significantly harmed 

table of contents we face substantial competition  and if we fail to compete effectively  our operating results will suffer 
the markets for our products are intensely competitive  and we believe that competition from both new and existing competitors will increase in the future 
we compete in several specialized markets  against a limited number of companies in each market 
we also face competition in some of our markets from our existing and potential customers who have developed or may develop products that are competitive to ours 
many of our existing and potential competitors are more established  enjoy greater name recognition and possess greater financial  technological and marketing resources than we do 
other competitors are small and highly specialized firms that are able to focus on only one aspect of a market 
we compete on the basis of product features  quality  reliability and price and on our ability to manufacture and deliver our products on a timely basis 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors 
in addition  competitive pressures may force us to reduce our prices  which could negatively affect our operating results 
if we do not respond adequately to competitive challenges  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
acquisitions of additional businesses  products or technologies we may make could negatively affect our business 
we have historically achieved growth through a combination of internally developed new products and acquisitions 
in recent years we have acquired several companies and technologies  and we expect to continue to pursue acquisitions of other companies  technologies and complementary product lines in the future to expand our product offerings and technology base to further our strategic goals 
each of our recent acquisitions involves  and any future acquisition would involve risks  including a decline in demand by our customers for the products of the acquired business  our ability to integrate the acquired business operations  products and personnel  our ability to retain key personnel of the acquired businesses  our ability to manufacture and sell the products of the acquired businesses  our ability to expand our financial and management controls and reporting systems and procedures to integrate the acquired businesses  our ability to realize expected synergies resulting from the acquisition  diversion of management s time and attention  customer dissatisfaction or performance problems with the products or services of an acquired firm  assumption of unknown liabilities  or other unanticipated events or circumstances  and the need to record significant charges or write down the carrying value of intangible assets  which could lower our earnings 
we cannot assure that any business that we may acquire will achieve anticipated revenues and operating results 
any of these risks could materially harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are delayed in introducing our new products into the marketplace  or if our new products contain defects  our operating results will suffer 
because certain of our products are sophisticated and complex  we may experience delays in introducing new products or enhancements to our existing products 
if we do not introduce our new products or enhancements into the marketplace in a timely fashion  our customers may choose to use competitors products 
our inability to introduce new or enhanced products in a timely manner could cause our business and results of operations to suffer 
our products may also contain defects or undetected errors 
as a result  we could incur substantial expenses in fixing any defects or undetected errors  which could result in damage to our competitive position and harm our business and results of operations 

table of contents if we are unable to attract new employees and retain and motivate existing employees  our business and results of operations will suffer 
our ability to maintain and grow our business is directly related to the service of our employees in each area of our operations 
our future performance will be directly tied to our ability to hire  train  motivate and retain qualified personnel 
competition for personnel in the technology marketplace is intense  and if we are unable to hire sufficient numbers of employees with the experience and skills we need or to retain our employees  our business and results of operations would be harmed 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property and proprietary technology  we may lose our competitive advantage 
our success and ability to compete depend in large part upon protecting our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  trademark and trade secret protection and nondisclosure agreements to protect our proprietary rights 
the steps we have taken may not be sufficient to prevent the misappropriation of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
the patent and trademark law and trade secret protection may not be adequate to deter third party infringement or misappropriation of our patents  trademarks and similar proprietary rights 
in addition  patents issued to us may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
our rights granted under those patents may not provide competitive advantages to us  and the claims under our patent applications may not be allowed 
we may be subject to or may initiate interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office  which can demand significant financial and management resources 
the process of seeking patent protection can be time consuming and expensive and patents may not be issued from currently pending or future applications 
moreover  our existing patents or any new patents that may be issued may not be sufficient in scope or strength to provide meaningful protection or any commercial advantage to us 
we may in the future initiate claims or litigation against third parties for infringement of our proprietary rights in order to determine the scope and validity of our proprietary rights or the proprietary rights of our competitors  which claims could result in costly litigation and the diversion of our technical and management personnel 
for example  we have notified several manufacturers of semiconductor wafer handling robots and load ports that we believe that they are infringing upon certain of our us patents 
we will take such actions where we believe that they are of sufficient strategic or economic importance to us to justify the cost 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  intellectual property infringement claims 
we have from time to time received communications from third parties alleging that we are infringing certain trademarks  patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
for example  newport electronics  inc  a manufacturer of electronic devices  filed suit against us claiming that our use of the newport trademark infringes its rights with respect to such mark 
in addition  we periodically receive correspondence from third parties alleging that certain of our products infringe patent rights held by them 
whenever claims arise  we evaluate their merits 
any claims of infringement brought by third parties could result in protracted and costly litigation  and we could become subject to damages for infringement  or to an injunction preventing us from selling one or more of our products or using one or more of our trademarks 
such claims could also result in the necessity of obtaining a license relating to one or more of our products or current or future technologies  which may not be available on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
any intellectual property litigation and the failure to obtain necessary licenses or other rights could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the terms of our customer contracts typically require us to indemnify the customer in the event of any claim of infringement brought by a third party based on our products 
any such claims of this kind may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 

table of contents we rely on several sole source and limited source suppliers 
we obtain some of the materials used to build our systems and subsystems  such as the sheet steel used in some of our vibration isolation tables  from single or limited sources due to unique component designs as well as specialized quality and performance requirements needed to manufacture our products 
if our components or raw materials are unavailable in adequate amounts or are unavailable on satisfactory terms  we may be required to purchase them from alternative sources  if available  which could increase our costs and cause delays in the production and distribution of our products 
if we do not obtain comparable replacement components from other sources in a timely manner  our business and results of operations will be harmed 
many of our suppliers require long lead times to deliver the quantities of components that we need 
if we fail to accurately forecast our needs  or if we fail to obtain sufficient quantities of components that we use to manufacture our products  then delays or reductions in production and shipment could occur  which would harm our business and results of operations 
terrorism and acts of war and the associated economic uncertainties may negatively impact our business 
terrorist attacks and potential military activities have created economic and political uncertainties  contributing to the current global economic downturn 
future acts of terrorism or increased military action may create additional uncertainties and worsen or delay recovery of the global economy  which could negatively impact our business  financial condition or results of operations 
natural disasters could disrupt or shut down our operations 
our operations are susceptible to damages from earthquakes  floods  fire  loss of power or water supplies  or other similar contingencies 
we have significant facilities in areas with above average seismic activity 
if any of our facilities were to experience a catastrophic loss  it could disrupt our operations  delay production  shipments and revenue  and result in large expenses to repair or replace the facility  any of which would harm our business 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by earthquakes 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the principal market risks ie  the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices to which we are exposed are foreign exchange rates which may generate translation and transaction gains and losses and interest rate risk 
foreign currency risk operating in international markets sometimes involves exposure to volatile movements in currency exchange rates 
the economic impact of currency exchange rate movements on our operating results is complex because such changes are often linked to variability in real growth  inflation  interest rates  governmental actions and other factors 
these changes  if material  may cause us to adjust our financing and operating strategies 
consequently  isolating the effect of changes in currency does not incorporate these other important economic factors 
we use forward exchange contracts to mitigate the risks associated with certain foreign currency transactions entered into in the ordinary course of business  primarily foreign currency denominated receivables 
we do not engage in currency speculation 
the forward exchange contracts generally require us to exchange us dollars for foreign currencies at maturity  at rates agreed to at inception of the contracts 
if the counterparties to the exchange contracts aa or a rated banks do not fulfill their obligations to deliver the contracted currencies  we could be at risk for any currency related fluctuations 
transaction gains and losses are included in current earnings 
foreign exchange contracts totaled million at december  net foreign exchange gains and losses were not material to our earnings for the last three years 

table of contents operating profit from international operations totaled million and million for and  respectively 
as currency exchange rates change  translation of the income statements of international operations into us dollars affects year over year comparability of operating results 
we do not generally hedge translation risks because cash flows from international operations are generally reinvested locally 
we do not enter into hedges to minimize volatility of reported earnings because we do not believe it is justified by the exposure or the cost 
changes in currency exchange rates that would have the largest impact on translating future international operating profit include the euro  british pound  canadian dollar  and swiss franc 
we estimate that a change in foreign exchange rates would not have materially affected reported operating profit for the year ended december  we believe that this quantitative measure has inherent limitations because  as discussed in the first paragraph of this section  it does not take into account other important economic factors interrelated to such changes  or any changes in customer purchasing patterns or financing and operating strategies 
interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to our unsecured line of credit and our investments in marketable securities 
our line of credit bears interest at either the prevailing prime rate  or the prevailing london interbank offered rate plus  at our option 
no amounts were outstanding under this line of credit as of december  our long term debt instruments carry fixed interest rates 
our investments in marketable securities  which totaled million at december   are sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
we estimate that a decline in the interest earned on our investment portfolio would have resulted in an after tax decline in our net income of million for the year ended december  the sensitivity analyses presented in the interest rate and foreign exchange discussions above disregard the possibility that rates can move in opposite directions and that gains from one category may or may not be offset by losses from another category and vice versa
