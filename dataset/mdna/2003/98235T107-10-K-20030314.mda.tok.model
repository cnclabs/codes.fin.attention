the factors discussed in this section are in addition to factors that may be described in the md a captions discussed above and elsewhere in this report 
overview we are a global orthopaedic device company specializing in the design  manufacture and marketing of reconstructive joint devices and bio orthopaedic materials 
reconstructive joint devices are used to replace knee  hip and other joints that have deteriorated through disease or injury 
bio orthopaedic materials are used to replace damaged or diseased bone and to stimulate bone growth 
we have been in business for over fifty years and have built a well known and respected brand name and strong relationships with orthopaedic surgeons 
our corporate headquarters and us operations are located in arlington  tennessee  where we conduct our domestic manufacturing  warehousing  research and administrative activities 
outside the us  we operate manufacturing and administrative facilities in toulon  france  research  distribution and administrative facilities in milan  italy and sales and distribution offices in canada  japan and across europe 
our global distribution system consists of a sales force of more than persons that market our products to orthopaedic surgeons and hospitals 
we have approximately exclusive independent distributors and sales associates in the us  and approximately sales representatives internationally who are employed through a combination of our stocking distribution partners and direct sales offices 

table of contents on december   an investment group led by warburg  pincus  equity partners  lp warburg acquired majority ownership of our predecessor company  wright medical technology  inc  in a transaction that recapitalized our business 
on december   we acquired cremascoli ortho holding  sa cremascoli  an orthopaedic device company based in toulon  france 
as a result of this acquisition  we enhanced our product development capabilities  expanded our presence in europe and extended our product offerings 
our recapitalization and the cremascoli acquisition were both accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
following our december recapitalization  a new management team was put in place 
this new management team has implemented a successful turnaround strategy that has increased our focus and spending on research and development  significantly raised the efficiency of our manufacturing processes and improved our sales force productivity 
since then  we have experienced growth in net sales across our primary product lines  improved our operating efficiencies and renewed our ability to meet our debt service and repayment obligations  which following the initial public offering the ipo  have been significantly reduced 
on july   we completed our ipo  issuing  shares of voting common stock at per share  the net proceeds of which were million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
we have used the net proceeds of our initial public offering to repay debt 
simultaneous with the closing of the offering  all of our outstanding mandatorily redeemable  convertible preferred stock  plus accrued dividends  was converted into  shares of common stock 
also in connection with the offering  warburg converted approximately million of our senior subordinated notes into  shares of non voting common stock 
on march   the company and certain selling stockholders completed a secondary offering of  shares  including the overallotment option of  shares  of voting common stock at per share 
of the  shares  the company offered  shares in the secondary offering 
the net proceeds of million  after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses  have been principally invested in short term  investment grade securities 
following the closing of the secondary offering  warburg converted all of its shares of non voting common stock into shares of voting common stock 
consequently  there are no outstanding shares of non voting common stock 
net sales in our international markets totaled million  or approximately of our total net sales in  million  or approximately of our total net sales in  and million  or approximately of our total net sales in no single foreign country accounted for more than of our total net sales during  or  however  italy and france together represented approximately of our total net sales in and  and in net sales and expense components net sales we derive our net sales primarily from the sale of reconstructive joint devices and bio orthopaedic materials 
our reconstructive joint device net sales are derived from three primary product lines knees  hips and extremities 
other product sales consist of various orthopaedic products not considered to be part of our knee  hip  extremity or bio orthopaedic product lines that we manufacture directly or distribute for others 
while our other product sales may increase in amount and or as a percentage of total net sales in the future  we do not expect that our other product sales will grow at a rate commensurate with our reconstructive joint device and bio orthopaedic product lines where our resources are focused 

table of contents our total net sales were million in  million in  and million in the following table sets forth our net sales by product line for   and expressed as a dollar amount and as a percentage of total net sales year ended december  in thousands knee products hip products extremity products bio orthopaedic materials other total net sales as a percentage of total net sales knee products hip products extremity products bio orthopaedic materials other total net sales expenses cost of sales 
cost of sales consists primarily of direct labor  allocated manufacturing overhead  raw materials and components  royalty expenses associated with licensing technologies used in our products or processes and certain other period expenses 
cost of sales and corresponding gross profit percentages can be expected to fluctuate in future periods depending upon changes in our product sales mix and prices  distribution channels and geographies  manufacturing yields  period expenses and levels of production volume 
our cost of sales for the year ended december  are not comparable to those of other periods because under us generally accepted accounting principles  we were required to step up our inventories in connection with our december recapitalization and acquisition of cremascoli  in the amount of million 
accordingly  cost of sales was charged million in the year ended december  the following table sets forth our cost of sales expressed as a percentage of sales for   and  adjusted to exclude the cost of sales associated with these inventory step ups year ended december  cost of sales effect of acquisition costs assigned to inventory adjusted cost of sales selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expense consists primarily of salaries  sales commissions  royalty expenses and consulting costs associated with our medical advisors  marketing costs  facility costs  other general business and administrative expenses and depreciation expense associated with surgical instruments that we loan to surgeons to use when implanting our products 
these surgical instruments are depreciated over their useful life of to years 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute 
table of contents dollars in future periods to the extent that any further growth in net sales drives commissions and royalties  as we incur anticipated increased premiums for certain of our insurance programs  and as we continue to add infrastructure to support our expected business growth and public company requirements 
however  we expect these expenses as a historical percentage of net sales to gradually decrease as we leverage our infrastructure additions 
research and development 
research and development expense includes costs associated with the design  development  testing  deployment  enhancement and regulatory approval of our products 
we anticipate that our research and development expenditures will increase in absolute dollars in future periods as we continue to increase our investment in product development initiatives 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net sales are not expected to decrease in future periods and may increase 
amortization of intangibles 
intangible assets consist of purchased intangibles principally related to completed technology  distribution channels and trademarks 
in  we reduced net intangible assets by approximately million and goodwill by approximately million as a result of the release of a portion of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets see note to the financial statements contained in item of this report 
intangible assets are amortized over periods ranging from months to years 
until january   goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  we ceased amortizing goodwill and instead evaluate it at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
effective january  and october   we evaluated goodwill for impairment and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
at december  and  we had net intangible assets  excluding goodwill  totaling million and million  respectively 
based on the intangible assets held at december   we expect to amortize approximately million in  million in  million in  million in and million in stock based expense 
stock based expense includes the amortization of the non cash deferred compensation recorded in connection with the issuance of stock options to employees and the sale of equity securities when the estimated fair value of the securities is deemed for financial reporting purposes to exceed their respective exercise or sales price 
additionally  for stock based incentives granted to consultants  we defer and amortize the fair value of such grants as calculated pursuant to sfas no 
we amortize deferred compensation on a straight line basis over the respective vesting periods of the stock based incentives  which is generally four years  and we immediately expense all stock based compensation associated with the issuance of equity where no vesting restrictions apply 
the substantial majority of our stock based expense relates to the issuance of shares and options prior to the completion of our ipo in july we generated approximately million and million of deferred stock based compensation for the years ended december  and  respectively related to stock grants  stock option grants and the sale of preferred stock to employees 
we recognized million  million and million of stock based expense during  and  respectively  which was principally related to this deferred compensation 
based upon the stock based awards outstanding at december   we expect to recognize million in  million in   in and a minimal amount in as non cash stock based expense 
arbitration settlement award 
during the first quarter of  we received a favorable award totaling million in a commercial arbitration proceeding with a former business services provider 
the award  which we recognized as operating income in the first quarter of  was subsequently collected in cash in april interest expense  net 
interest expense consists primarily of interest associated with borrowings outstanding under our senior credit facilities and  as it relates to and  our subordinated 
table of contents notes  offset partially by interest income on invested cash balances of approximately   and  in   and  respectively 
interest expense includes  in   in and  in  of non cash expense associated with the amortization of deferred financing costs resulting from the origination of our senior credit facilities 
during the third quarter of  we repaid amounts outstanding under our previous euro denominated senior credit facility  and renegotiated the terms of our current senior credit facility 
we used the net proceeds from our july ipo to repay debt  and we invested the net proceeds of our march follow on offering in interest bearing  investment grade securities 
consequently  net interest expense in the periods following our initial and follow on public offerings was less than interest in the comparable prior periods 
other income expense  net 
other income expense consists primarily of net gains and losses resulting from foreign currency fluctuations 
we expect other income and expense to fluctuate in future periods depending upon our relative exposures to foreign currency risk and ultimate fluctuations in exchange rates 
provision benefit for income taxes 
our cash payment of income taxes to date has generally been limited to tax on earnings generated by certain of our foreign operations  principally in europe 
domestically  we have incurred no tax liability in recent years 
at december   we have net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million domestically  which expire in through  and million internationally  which expire in through generally  we are limited in the amount of net operating loss carryforwards which can be utilized in any given year 
additionally  we have domestic general business credit carryforwards of approximately million  which expire in through prior to  we provided a valuation allowance against all of our net deferred tax assets for united states income tax purposes and a portion of our net deferred tax assets for foreign income tax purposes because  given our history of operating losses  the realizability of these assets was uncertain 
during the year ended december   our effective tax rate for financial reporting purposes totaled approximately of pretax income  which is significantly lower than our combined applicable statutory rates  which we estimated to be approximately in the sustained operating performance in our recent history  combined with the reduced debt burden following our ipo  have made the realizability of our deferred tax assets considerably more likely  and therefore  during  we reversed a significant portion of the valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets for united states income tax purposes  thereby reducing our effective tax rate to a percentage that is lower than our combined applicable statutory rates 
this reduction resulted in an million non cash benefit to our provision for income taxes during the year ended december  we expect our effective tax rate to increase from that incurred during to a percentage more representative of our combined federal  state and foreign statutory rates 
our united states federal net operating loss carryforwards are subject to certain annual limitations  and due to these limitations  some of our net operating losses may expire unused 
the valuation allowance remaining at december  is for a portion of our deferred tax assets for united states income tax purposes and a portion of our deferred tax assets for foreign income tax purposes 
we will continue to reassess the realization of the remainder of our deferred tax assets and adjust the related valuation allowance as necessary 
extraordinary loss on early retirement of debt 
as a result of our ipo in  we repaid amounts outstanding under our previous euro denominated senior credit facility  and renegotiated the terms of our current senior credit facility 
accordingly  we incurred an extraordinary non cash charge totaling approximately million during the third quarter of  principally related to unamortized loan costs relating to that debt 
we expect the amortization of deferred financing costs to approximate  annually over the remaining term of our new senior credit facility

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table presents a summary of our unaudited quarterly operating results for each of the four quarters in and  respectively 
we derived this information from unaudited interim financial statements that  in the opinion of management  have been prepared on a basis consistent with the financial statements contained elsewhere in this filing and include all adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  necessary for a fair statement of such information when read in conjunction with our audited financial statements and related notes

table of contents liquidity and capital resources we have funded our cash needs since through various equity and debt issuances and through cash flow from operations 
on july  we completed our ipo issuing  shares of voting common stock at per share  the net proceeds of which were million after deducting underwriting discounts and offering expenses 
we used the net proceeds of our ipo to repay debt  which at the time consisted of amounts outstanding under a euro denominated senior credit facility  amounts outstanding under a dollar denominated senior credit facility  and subordinated notes plus accrued interest 
simultaneous with the closing of the ipo  all of our outstanding mandatorily redeemable  convertible preferred stock  plus accrued dividends  was converted into  shares of common stock 
also in connection with the ipo  senior subordinated notes totaling approximately million aggregate principal amount  which were held by warburg  were converted into  shares of non voting common stock 
on august   we renegotiated the terms of our dollar denominated senior credit facility  resulting in a new five year senior credit facility with more favorable terms than we had previously 
the new senior credit facility consists of million in term loans and an unused revolving loan facility of up to million 
upon entering into the new senior credit facility  we used the million in term loan proceeds and existing cash balances to repay all remaining amounts outstanding plus accrued interest under our previous dollar denominated senior credit facility  totaling approximately million 
thus  following our ipo  the use of proceeds and related transactions as described above  we had approximately million of debt outstanding  excluding capitalized lease obligations 
borrowings under the senior credit facility are guaranteed by all of our subsidiaries and collateralized by all of the assets of wright medical technology  inc  our wholly owned subsidiary  and our other domestic subsidiaries 
the credit facility contains customary covenants including  among other things  restrictions on our ability to pay cash dividends  prepay debt  incur additional debt and sell assets 
the credit facility also requires us to meet certain financial tests  including a consolidated leverage or debt to equity ratio test and a consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio test 
at our option  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest either at a rate equal to a fixed base rate plus a spread of 
to or at a rate equal to an adjusted libor plus a spread of to  depending on our consolidated leverage ratio 
on march   the company and certain selling stockholders completed a secondary offering of  shares  including the overallotment option of  shares  of voting common stock at per share 
of these  shares  we offered  resulting in net proceeds to the company of million  after the underwriting discount and other public offering expenses  which have been invested in short term  investment grade securities 
we intend to use the net proceeds from the secondary offering for general corporate purposes  including to fund working capital  expansion of our current product offerings through research and development  and acquisitions of technologies  products and companies 
we anticipate our spending on research and development to remain consistent with our past levels of spending as a percentage of net sales 

table of contents at december  we had contractual cash obligations and commercial commitments as follows payments due by periods total after long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations total contractual cash obligations our purchase obligations consist of minimum purchase obligations related to certain supply agreements as well as payments under royalty and consultant agreements based on certain sales volumes 
in february  we became contractually obligated to purchase certain assets from gliatech inc for million in cash and a royalty on future product sales 
these assets primarily consist of purchased technology and certain machinery and equipment required for the purchased technology 
at the time of this filing in march  we have completed the purchase of these assets and have satisfied million of the total obligation 
we will satisfy the remaining obligation of million upon delivery of the assets 
at december   we had cash and equivalents totaling approximately million  working capital totaling million and availability under committed credit facilities  after considering outstanding letters of credit  totaling million 
we generated approximately million of cash in operating activities during the year ended december  compared to  of cash generated by operating activities during the year ended december  operating cash flows for the year ended december  were negatively affected by approximately million of costs associated with certain international distributorship transitions and million of costs related to our annual insurance renewal  and favorably affected by the receipt of a million arbitration settlement award 
additionally  we made significant investments in new product inventory which negatively impacted operating cash flows as compared to prior year 
operating cash flows for the year ended december  were negatively affected by the payment of approximately million in accrued interest on the senior subordinated notes that were paid off as a result of our ipo and million of unrestricted cash used in an intellectual property license settlement 
cash generated in operating activities totaled million in capital expenditures totaled approximately million in  million in  and million in historically  our capital expenditures have consisted primarily of purchased manufacturing equipment  research and testing equipment  computer systems  office furniture and equipment  and surgical instruments 
we expect to incur capital expenditures of approximately million in total for  approximately million of which we anticipate will be used in the continued implementation process of our enterprise computer system and million of which we anticipate will be used for routine recurring capital expenditures  including surgical instruments 
although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements  we believe that our current cash balances  our existing credit lines and other available sources of liquidity  and expected cash flows from our operating activities  will be sufficient for the foreseeable future to fund our working capital requirements and operations  permit anticipated capital expenditures and make required payments of principal and interest on our debt 
we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations in recent years and periods 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be adversely affected by inflation in the future 

table of contents significant accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies require the application of significant judgment by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgments are based on our historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the industry  information provided by our customers  and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate 
different estimates reasonably could have been used in the current period  or changes in the accounting estimates are reasonably likely to occur from period to period  that could have a material impact on the presentation of the company s financial condition  changes in financial condition or results of operations 
we believe that the following financial estimates are both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require subjective or complex judgments 
further  we believe that the items discussed below are properly recorded in the financial statements for all periods presented 
management has discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of our most critical financial estimates with the audit committee 
the judgments about those financial estimates are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements 
those financial estimates include sales returns and allowances for doubtful accounts 
we make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenues 
in doing so  we analyze historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of our sales return reserve 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
for each of the years ended december    and  we estimated future product sales returns in a consistent manner using the aforementioned data  which  consequently  has resulted in an effect of less than of net sales on gross margin in each respective year 
similarly  we estimate the uncollectibility of our accounts receivables 
we specifically analyze our accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  and current economic trends  when evaluating the adequacy of our allowance for doubtful accounts 
for each of the years ended december    and  we estimated the uncollectibility of our accounts receivable in a consistent manner using the aforementioned data  which  consequently  has resulted in an effect of less than of net sales on total operating expenses in each respective year 
our accounts receivable balance was million and million  net of allowances for sales returns of  and  and allowances for doubtful accounts of million and million  at december  and  respectively 
excess and obsolete inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or its net realizable value 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements for the next twenty four months 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a decrease in the amount of excess inventory on hand while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
additionally  our industry is characterized by regular new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory quantities on hand due to cannibalization of existing products 
also  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may be required to increase or decrease the provision required for excess and obsolete inventory 
in the future  if additional inventory write downs are required  we would recognize additional cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 

table of contents for each of the years ended december    and  cost of goods sold included expense that  as a percentage of net sales  totaled   and  respectively as a result of our evaluation of the net realizable value of our inventory 
at december  and  our inventory balance was million and million  respectively 
product liability claims 
from time to time  claims arise involving the use of our products 
we make provisions for claims specifically identified for which we believe the likelihood of an unfavorable outcome is probable and estimable 
we have recorded at least the minimum estimated liability related to those claims where there is a range of loss 
because of the uncertainties related to the likelihood and amount of loss on any other remaining pending claims  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome of those claims 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess the estimated liability related to our pending claims and make revisions as necessary 
future revisions in our estimates of the liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
we maintain insurance coverage that limits the severity of any single claim as well as total amounts incurred per policy year  and we believe our insurance coverage is adequate 
we make every effort to use the best information available to us in determining the level of accrued product liabilities and we believe our accruals are adequate 
for each of the years ended december   and  operating expenses were not materially affected by our estimates of product liability claims 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to determine our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax expense together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing recognition of items for income tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must reflect this increase as an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
management s judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million and million as of december  and  respectively  due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize  before expiration  some of our deferred tax assets for both us and foreign income tax purposes  primarily consisting of the carry forward of certain net operating losses and general business tax credits 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to increase or decrease our valuation allowance which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
the decrease in the valuation allowance during is based on our current projection of the amount of deferred tax assets that are more likely than not to be realized in the future based on our operating results in recent years  our forecast of future operations  and our reduced debt burden following our ipo 
because a significant amount of our valuation allowance was recorded during our recapitalization  the subsequent decrease in this portion of the valuation allowance first reduced goodwill and then other intangible assets 
the reduction in the valuation allowance recorded subsequent to the recapitalization reduced our income tax provision 
as a result  for the year ended december   our provision for income tax was reduced by million  resulting in higher net income by this amount 
management will continue to monitor the realizability of its deferred tax assets and adjust the valuation allowance accordingly 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets totaling million 
as of december   we had net deferred tax liabilities totaling million 

table of contents impact of recently issued accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  which requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for under the purchase method 
sfas no 
continues the previous requirement for a company to recognize goodwill for the excess of the cost of an acquired company over the fair value of the assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
it also requires that items be separated from goodwill if they arise from contractual or other legal rights or are separable 
intangibles that do not meet this test should be included in goodwill 
we determined that our workforce intangible does not meet the criteria for recognition as a separate identifiable intangible asset and thus  effective january   we reclassified the net book value of our workforce intangible asset net of associated deferred tax liabilities  of million  into goodwill 
effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but rather evaluated for impairment at the reporting unit level upon adoption and at least annually thereafter 
accordingly  we engaged an independent third party to determine the fair value of our reporting units as defined by sfas no 
effective january  based on this evaluation  the fair values of our reporting units were determined to exceed the carrying value of those reporting units  therefore indicating that none of the goodwill was impaired 
absent any impairment indicators  we perform our annual impairment evaluation during the fourth quarter 
accordingly  effective october   we evaluated goodwill for impairment and determined that the fair values of our reporting units continued to exceed their carrying values  indicating that goodwill was not impaired 
if sfas no 
had been applied in and  amortization expense would have been reduced by million and net income would have been increased by million  or

we reviewed the requirements in apb and determined that the loss on our early retirement of debt recognized in the third quarter of does not meet the necessary criteria in order to be classified as an extraordinary item 
therefore  the loss on our early retirement of debt will be reclassified within operating expenses effective january  we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  effective january  sfas no

this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  and are not expected to have a material effect on our financial statements 
to date we have not entered into or modified any such guarantees 
factors affecting future operating results in addition to the factors described above in this discussion and analysis  our future financial results could vary from period to period due to a variety of causes  including the following factors our future profitability depends on the success of our principal product lines and growth of our other product lines sales of our knee and hip implant products accounted for approximately of our net sales for the year ended december  we expect our sales to continue to be based largely on sales of these principal product lines and specifically our advance knee system and perfecta total hip system 
introduction of competitive products by third parties  adverse rulings by regulatory authorities  product liability lawsuits or other adverse publicity for these principal product lines may significantly and adversely affect our sales of these products and  as a result  would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
additionally  our bio orthopaedic and extremity product lines have been a significant component of our historical growth rate and is expected to be in the future 
net sales of our bio orthopaedic product line grew and during the years ended december  and  respectively  and represented and of net sales in the years then ended  respectively 
net sales of our extremity product line grew in each of the years ended december  and  respectively  and represented and of net sales in the years then ended  respectively 
introduction of competitive products by third parties  adverse rulings by regulatory authorities  product liability lawsuits or other adverse publicity for these product lines may significantly and adversely affect our sales within these product lines and  as a result  would adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we fail to compete successfully in the future against our existing or potential competitors  our sales and operating results may be negatively affected and we may not achieve future growth the markets for our products are highly competitive and dominated by a small number of large companies 
we may not be able to meet the prices offered by our competitors  or offer products 
table of contents similar to or more desirable than those offered by our competitors 
see competition in item of this form k for more information about our competitors 
if we are unable to continue to develop and market new products and technologies  we may experience a decrease in demand for our products or our products could become obsolete  and our business would suffer we are continually engaged in product development and improvement programs  and new products represent a significant component of our growth rate 
we may be unable to compete effectively with our competitors unless we can keep up with existing or new products and technologies in the orthopaedic implant market 
if we don t continue to introduce new products and technologies  or if those products and technologies are not accepted  we may not be successful 
additionally  our competitors new products and technologies may beat our products to market  may be more effective or less expensive than our products or render our products obsolete 
see competition in item of this form k for more information about our competitors 
if surgeons do not recommend and endorse our products  our sales may decline or we may be unable to increase our sales and profits in order for us to sell our products  surgeons must recommend and endorse them 
we may not obtain the necessary recommendations or endorsements from surgeons 
acceptance of our products depends on educating the medical community as to the distinctive characteristics  perceived benefits  clinical efficacy and cost effectiveness of our products compared to products of our competitors  and on training surgeons in the proper application of our products 
our business plan relies on certain assumptions about the market for our products  which  if incorrect  may adversely affect our profitability we believe that the aging of the general population and increasingly active lifestyles will continue and that these trends will increase the need for our orthopaedic implant products 
the projected demand for our products could materially differ from actual demand if our assumptions regarding these trends and acceptance of our products by the medical community prove to be incorrect or do not materialize  or if non surgical treatments gain more widespread acceptance as a viable alternative to orthopaedic implants 
we are subject to substantial government regulation that could have a material adverse effect on our business the production and marketing of our products and our ongoing research and development  preclinical testing and clinical trial activities are subject to extensive regulation and review by numerous governmental authorities both in the us and abroad 
see government regulation in item of this form k for further details on this process 
us and foreign regulations govern the testing  marketing and registration of new medical devices  in addition to regulating manufacturing practices  reporting  labeling and record keeping procedures 
the regulatory process requires significant time  effort and expenditures to bring our products to market  and we cannot assure you that any of our products will be approved 
our failure to comply with applicable regulatory requirements could result in these government authorities imposing fines and penalties on us  preventing us from manufacturing or selling our products  bringing civil or criminal charges against us  delaying the introduction of our new products into the market  
table of contents recalling or seizing our products  or withdrawing or denying approvals or clearances for our products 
even if regulatory approval or clearance of a product is granted  this could result in limitations on uses for which the product may be labeled and promoted 
further  for a marketed product  its manufacturer and manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic review and inspection 
later discovery of problems with a product  manufacturer or facility may result in restrictions on the product  manufacturer or facility  including withdrawal of the product from the market or other enforcement actions 
we are currently conducting clinical studies of some of our products under an ide 
clinical studies must be conducted in compliance with fda regulations  or the fda may take enforcement action 
the data collected from these clinical investigations will ultimately be used to support market clearance for these products 
there is no assurance that the fda will accept the data from these clinical studies or that it will ultimately allow market clearance for these products 
modifications to our marketed devices may require fda regulatory clearances or approvals or require us to cease marketing or recall the modified devices until such clearances or approvals are obtained when required  the products we market in the us have obtained premarket notification under section k or were exempt from the k clearance process 
we have modified some of our products and product labeling since obtaining k clearance but we do not believe these modifications require us to submit new k notifications 
however  if the fda disagrees with us and requires us to submit a new k notification for modifications to our existing products  we may be the subject of enforcement actions by the fda and be required to stop marketing the products while the fda reviews the k notification 
if the fda requires us to go through a lengthier  more rigorous examination than we had expected  our product introductions or modifications could be delayed or canceled  which could cause our sales to decline 
in addition  the fda may determine that future products will require the more costly  lengthy and uncertain pma process 
products that are approved through a pma generally need fda approval before they can be modified 
see government regulation in item of this form k 
our bio orthopaedics business is subject to emerging government regulations that can significantly impact our business the fda has statutory authority to regulate allograft based products  processing and materials 
the fda has been working to establish a more comprehensive regulatory framework for allograft based products  which are principally derived from cadaveric tissue 
the framework developed by the fda establishes criteria for determining whether a particular human tissue based product will be classified as human tissue  a medical device or biologic drug requiring premarket clearance or approval 
all tissue based products are subject to extensive fda regulation  including a requirement that ensures that diseases are not transmitted to tissue recipients 
the fda has also proposed extensive additional regulations that would govern the processing and distribution of all allograft products 
consent to use the donor s tissue must also be obtained 
if a tissue based product is considered tissue  it does not require fda clearance or approval before being marketed 
if it is considered a device or biologic drug  then fda clearance or approval may be required 
additionally  our bio orthopaedics business involves the procurement and transplantation of allograft tissue  which is subject to federal regulation under the national organ transplant act  or nota 
nota is a criminal statute that prohibits the sale of human organs for valuable consideration within the meaning of the act  including bone and other tissue 
nota permits the payment of reasonable expenses associated with the transportation  processing  preservation  quality control and storage of human tissue 
we currently charge our customers for these expenses 
in the future  if 
table of contents nota is amended or reinterpreted we may not be able to charge these expenses to our customers and  as a result  our business could be adversely affected 
we are currently pursuing fda clearance of our allomatrix products on april   the fda sent the company a warning letter stating that the fda believed allomatrix injectable putty was a medical device that was subject to premarket clearance 
in march  the fda officially notified the company that it concluded that allomatrix injectable putty was properly reviewed and regulated under the medical device premarket notification provisions of the fdc act 
also  in march  the fda notified all other known manufacturers of similar products of requirements for bringing such products into compliance with the fdc act 
the fda indicated that it would exercise enforcement discretion for a reasonable period of time while companies bring their devices into compliance with the fdc act 
in response to the fda determination  the company promptly filed a premarket notification for allomatrix injectable putty under section k of the fdc act 
on april   the fda notified the company that the submission of the company s premarket notification for allomatrix injectable putty was an adequate response to the warning letter and that the fda considered the issues raised in the april  letter closed 
the company s premarket notification submission is still pending with the fda 
the company s allomatrix line of products continue to be marketed and sold pending the approval of the premarket notification submission 
the fda has not raised any objection to the continued marketing and sale of the company s allomatrix line of products pending the approval of the premarket notification submission 
there can be no assurance that the k premarket notification will be cleared by the fda in a timely manner or at all 
the fda could decide not to continue to exercise its enforcement discretion and decide to take enforcement action which could include  but not be limited to  seizing product inventory  obtaining a court injunction against further marketing of the product  or assessing civil money penalties 
for the years ended december  and  our allomatrix products represented approximately and of our total net sales  respectively 
we will continue efforts to obtain market clearance for the re launch of the adcon gel products in the us there can be no assurance that the sale of the adcon gel products in the us will be cleared by the fda in a timely manner  or at all 
our business could suffer if the medical community does not continue to accept allograft technology new allograft products  technologies and enhancements may never achieve broad market acceptance due to numerous factors  including lack of clinical acceptance of allograft products and related technologies  the introduction of competitive tissue repair treatment options that render allograft products and technologies too expensive and obsolete  lack of available third party reimbursement  the inability to train surgeons in the use of allograft products and technologies  the risk of disease transmission  and ethical concerns about the commercial aspects of harvesting cadaveric tissue 
market acceptance will also depend on the ability to demonstrate that existing and new allografts and technologies are attractive alternatives to existing tissue repair treatment options 
to demonstrate this  we rely upon surgeon evaluations of the clinical safety  efficacy  ease of use  reliability and cost effectiveness of our tissue repair options and technologies 
recommendations and endorsements by influential surgeons are important to the commercial success of allograft products and 
table of contents technologies 
in addition  several countries  notably japan  prohibit the use of allografts 
if allograft products and technologies are not broadly accepted in the marketplace  we may not achieve a competitive position in the market 
we depend heavily upon a limited number of sources of demineralized bone matrix dbm and cancellous bone matrix cbm  and any failure to obtain dbm cbm from these sources in a timely manner will interfere with our ability to process and distribute allograft products two not for profit tissue banks supplied us with of the dbm cbm  a key component in the allograft products we currently produce  market and distribute  that we obtained in the united states in we cannot be sure that our supply of dbm cbm will continue to be available at current levels or will be sufficient to meet our needs  or that our suppliers of dbm cbm will be free from fda regulatory action impacting their sale of dbm cbm 
since there is a small number of suppliers  if we cannot continue to obtain dbm cbm from these sources in volume sufficient to meet our needs  we may not be able to locate replacement sources of dbm cbm on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
this could have the effect of interrupting our business  which could adversely affect our sales 
if adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors for our products are not obtained  surgeons and patients may be reluctant to use our products and our sales may decline in the us  health care providers that purchase our products generally rely on third party payors  principally federal medicare  state medicaid and private health insurance plans  to pay for all or a portion of the cost of joint reconstructive procedures and products utilized in those procedures 
we may be unable to sell our products on a profitable basis if third party payors deny coverage or reduce their current levels of reimbursement 
our sales depend largely on government health care programs and private health insurers reimbursing patients medical expenses 
surgeons  hospitals and other health care providers may not purchase our products if they do not receive satisfactory reimbursement from these third party payors for the cost of the procedures using our products 
payors continue to review their coverage policies carefully for existing and new therapies and can  without notice  deny coverage for treatments that include the use of our products 
in addition  some health care providers in the us have adopted or are considering a managed care system in which the providers contract to provide comprehensive heath care for a fixed cost per person 
health care providers may attempt to control costs by authorizing fewer elective surgical procedures  including joint reconstructive surgeries  or by requiring the use of the least expensive implant available 
if adequate levels of reimbursement from third party payors outside of the united states are not obtained  international sales of our products may decline 
outside of the united states  reimbursement systems vary significantly by country 
many foreign markets have government managed health care systems that govern reimbursement for new devices and procedures 
canada  and some european and asian countries  in particular france  taiwan  and korea  have tightened reimbursement rates 
additionally  some foreign reimbursement systems provide for limited payments in a given period and therefore result in extended payment periods 
see third party reimbursement in item of this form k for more information regarding reimbursement in the us and abroad 
we derive a significant portion of our sales from operations in international markets that are subject to political  economic and social instability we derive a significant portion of our sales from operations in international markets 
our international distribution system consists of direct sales offices and approximately stocking distribution partners  which combined  employ approximately sales representatives who sell in over countries 
some of these countries are  to some degree  subject to political  social and or economic instability 
for the years ended december  and  approximately and 
table of contents of our net sales were derived from our international operations 
our international sales operations expose us and our representatives  agents and distributors to risks inherent in operating in foreign jurisdictions 
these risks include the imposition of additional foreign governmental controls or regulations on orthopaedic implants and bio orthopaedic products  new export license requirements particularly related to our bio orthopaedic products  economic instability  including currency risk between the us dollar and foreign currencies  in our target markets  a shortage of high quality international salespeople and distributors  changes in third party reimbursement policy that may require some of the patients who receive our implant products to directly absorb medical costs  changes in tariffs and other trade restrictions  particularly related to the exportation of our bio orthopaedic products  work stoppages or strikes in the health care industry  which have affected our operations in france  canada  korea and finland in the last twelve months  a shortage of nurses in some of our target markets  particularly affecting our operations in france  and exposure to different legal and political standards due to our conducting business in over countries 
accordingly  any material decrease in our foreign sales would negatively impact our profitability 
our international sales are predominately generated in europe 
in europe  health care regulation and reimbursement for medical devices vary significantly from country to country 
this changing environment could adversely affect our ability to sell our products in some european countries 
fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates could result in declines in our reported sales and earnings since a majority of our international sales are denominated in local currencies and not in us dollars  our reported sales and earnings are subject to fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
our international net sales were favorably affected by the impact of foreign currency fluctuations totaling million in  and adversely impacted by million in at present  we do not engage in hedging transactions to protect against uncertainty in future exchange rates between particular foreign currencies and us dollars 
if we lose one of our key suppliers  we may be unable to meet customer orders for our products in a timely manner or within our budget we rely on a limited number of suppliers for the components used in our products 
we rely on one supplier for the silicone elastomer used in our extremity products 
we are aware of only two suppliers of silicone elastomer to the medical device industry for permanent implant usage 
in addition  some of our new products under development use materials that are available only from limited sources 
suppliers of raw materials and components may decide for reasons beyond our control to cease supplying raw materials and components to us 
fda regulations may require additional testing of any raw materials or components from new suppliers prior to our use of these materials or components and in the case of a device with a pma  we may be required to obtain prior fda permission  either of which could delay or prevent our access or use of such raw materials or components 

table of contents if we are unable to obtain materials we need from our key suppliers and we cannot obtain these materials from other sources  we may be unable to manufacture our products for a period of time or within our manufacturing budget  which could negatively impact our profitability 
if our patents and other intellectual property rights do not adequately protect our products  we may lose market share to our competitors and be unable to operate our business profitably we rely on patents  trade secrets  copyrights  know how  trademarks  license agreements and contractual provisions to establish our intellectual property rights and protect our products 
these legal means  however  afford only limited protection and may not adequately protect our rights 
in addition  we cannot assure you that any of our pending patent applications will issue 
the pto may deny or require significant narrowing of claims in our pending patent applications  and patents issuing from the pending patent applications  if any  may not provide us with significant commercial protection 
we could incur substantial costs in proceedings before the pto 
these proceedings could result in adverse decisions as to the priority of our inventions and the narrowing or invalidation of claims in issued patents 
in addition  the laws of some of the countries in which our products are or may be sold may not protect our products and intellectual property to the same extent as us laws  or at all 
we may be unable to protect our rights in trade secrets and unpatented proprietary technology in these countries 
in addition  we hold licenses from third parties that are necessary to utilize certain technologies used in the design and manufacturing of some of our products 
the loss of such licenses would prevent us from manufacturing  marketing and selling these products  which could harm our business 
we seek to protect our trade secrets  know how and other unpatented proprietary technology  in part  with confidentiality agreements with our employees  independent distributors and consultants 
we cannot assure you  however  that the agreements will not be breached  that adequate remedies for any breach would be available  or that our trade secrets  know how  and other unpatented proprietary technology will not otherwise become known to or independently developed by our competitors 
if we lose any existing or future intellectual property lawsuits  a court could require us to pay significant damages or prevent us from selling our products the medical device industry is litigious with respect to patents and other intellectual property rights 
companies in the medical device industry have used intellectual property litigation to gain a competitive advantage 
we are currently involved in an intellectual property lawsuit with howmedica osteonics corp  a subsidiary of stryker corporation  where it is alleged that our advance knee product line infringes one of howmedica s patents 
see legal proceedings in item of this form k for more specific information regarding this lawsuit 
if howmedica osteonics corp 
were to succeed in obtaining the relief it claims  the court could award damages to howmedica osteonics corp  and could impose an injunction against further sales of this product 
if a final judgment is rendered against us  we may be forced to raise or borrow funds  as a supplement to any available insurance claim proceeds  to pay the damages award 
in the future  we may become a party to other lawsuits involving patents or other intellectual property 
a legal proceeding  regardless of the outcome  could drain our financial resources and divert the time and effort of our management 
if we lose one of these proceedings  a court  or a similar foreign governing body  could require us to pay significant damages to third parties  require us to seek licenses from third parties and pay ongoing royalties  require us to redesign our products or prevent us from manufacturing  using or selling our products 
in addition to being costly  protracted litigation to defend or prosecute our intellectual property rights could result in our customers or potential customers deferring or limiting their purchase or use of the affected products until resolution of the litigation 

table of contents if product liability lawsuits are brought against us  our business may be harmed the manufacture and sale of medical devices exposes us to significant risk of product liability claims 
in the past  we have had a number of product liability claims relating to our products 
in the future  we may be subject to additional product liability claims  some of which may have a negative impact on our business 
additionally  we could experience a material design or manufacturing failure in our products  a quality system failure  other safety issues  or heightened regulatory scrutiny that would warrant a recall of some of our products 
our existing product liability insurance coverage may be inadequate to protect us from any liabilities we might incur 
if a product liability claim or series of claims is brought against us for uninsured liabilities or in excess of our insurance coverage  our business could suffer 
in addition  a recall of some of our products  whether or not the result of a product liability claim  could result in significant costs to us 
we may be liable for contamination or other harm caused by hazardous materials that we use our research and development and manufacturing processes involve the use of hazardous materials 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulation governing the use  manufacture  handling  storage and disposal of hazardous materials 
we cannot completely eliminate the risk of contamination or injury resulting from hazardous materials and we may incur liability as a result of any contamination or injury 
in addition  under some environmental laws and regulations  we could also be held responsible for all of the costs relating to any contamination at our past or present facilities and at third party waste disposal sites 
although we have incurred immaterial costs to date relating to environmental consulting and monitoring fees  we may incur more significant expenses in the future relating to compliance with environmental laws 
such future expenses or liability could have a significant negative impact on our financial condition 
see environmental in item of this form k 
efforts to acquire other companies or product lines could adversely affect our operations and financial results we may pursue acquisitions of other companies or product lines 
our ability to grow through acquisitions depends upon our ability to identify  negotiate  complete and integrate suitable acquisitions and to obtain any necessary financing 
even if we complete acquisitions  we may also experience difficulties in integrating any acquired companies  personnel and products into our existing business  delays in realizing the benefits of the acquired company or products  diversion of our management s time and attention from other business concerns  limited or no direct prior experience in new markets or countries we may enter  higher costs of integration than we anticipated  or difficulties in retaining key employees of the acquired business who are necessary to manage these acquisitions 
in addition  an acquisition could materially impair our operating results by causing us to incur debt or requiring us to amortize acquisition expenses and acquired assets 

table of contents our quarterly operating results are subject to substantial fluctuations and you should not rely on them as an indication of our future results our quarterly operating results may vary significantly due to a combination of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include demand for products  which historically has been highest in the first and fourth quarters  our ability to meet the demand for our products  increased competition  the number  timing and significance of new products and product introductions and enhancements by us and our competitors  our ability to develop  introduce and market new and enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis  changes in pricing policies by us and our competitors  changes in the treatment practices of our surgeon customers  changes in distributor relationships and salesforce composition  the timing of significant orders and shipments  availability of raw materials  work stoppages or strikes in the health care industry  and general economic factors 
our acquisition of cremascoli may make it more difficult for us to evaluate and predict our future operating performance 
our historical results of operations as a combined entity are limited and only give effect to the operations of cremascoli since we acquired it in december consequently  our historical results of operations may not give you an accurate indication of how we  together with cremascoli  will perform in the future 
we believe that quarterly sales and operating results may vary significantly in the future and that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
we cannot assure you that our sales will increase or be sustained in future periods or that we will be profitable in any future period 
any shortfalls in sales or earnings from levels expected by securities or industry analysts could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
we rely on our independent sales distributors and sales associates to market and sell our products our success depends largely upon marketing arrangements with independent sales distributors and sales associates  in particular their sales and service expertise and relationships with the customers in the marketplace 
independent distributors and sales associates may terminate their relationship with us  or devote insufficient sales efforts to our products 
we do not control our independent distributors and they may not be successful in implementing our marketing plans 
our failure to maintain our existing relationship with our independent distributors and sales associates could have an adverse effect on our operations 
similarly  our failure to recruit and retain additional skilled independent sales distributors and sales associates could have an adverse effect on our operations 
we have experienced turnover with some of our independent distributors in the past which adversely affected short term financial results while we transitioned to new independent distributors 
while we believe these transitions have been managed effectively  similar occurrences 
table of contents could happen in the future with different results which could have a greater adverse effect on our operations than we have previously experienced 
if a natural or man made disaster strikes our manufacturing facilities  we will be unable to manufacture our products for a substantial amount of time and our sales will decline we have relied to date principally on our manufacturing facilities in arlington  tennessee and toulon  france 
these facilities and the manufacturing equipment we use to produce our products would be difficult to replace and could require substantial lead time to repair or replace 
our facilities may be affected by natural or man made disasters 
in the event one of our facilities was affected by a disaster  we would be forced to rely on third party manufacturers or shift production to our other manufacturing facility 
although we believe we possess adequate insurance for damage to our property and the disruption of our business from casualties  such insurance may not be sufficient to cover all of our potential losses and may not continue to be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
we have incurred net losses in the past and may not be profitable in the future we have incurred net losses in the past and there can be no assurances that we will not report net losses in the future  which could cause our stock price to decline and adversely affect our ability to finance our business in the future 
we reported net income of million in  and net losses of million in  million in  million in  and million in our net loss in was primarily attributable to interest costs on borrowed money and non cash expenses associated with the inventory step ups charged to cost of sales  the amortization of acquired intangibles and stock based compensation 
our net loss in was primarily attributable to interest costs on borrowed money and the non cash extraordinary charge related to the write off of unamortized loan costs associated with our past credit facilities 
our net income in was favorably affected by our april arbitration settlement award and the release of our valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  although we would still have recorded net income in without these favorable occurrences

if we cannot retain our key personnel  we will not be able to manage and operate successfully and we may not be able to meet our strategic objectives our continued success depends  in part  upon key managerial  scientific  sales and technical personnel  as well as our ability to continue to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
we compete for such personnel with other companies  academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in retaining our current personnel or in hiring or retaining qualified personnel in the future 
many of our existing management personnel have been employed by the company for three years or less  including our president and chief executive officer  who joined us in january  and our executive vice president and chief financial officer  who joined us in december our future success depends to a significant extent on the ability of our executive officers and other members of our management team to operate effectively  both individually and as a group 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to satisfactorily allocate responsibilities and that the new members of our executive team will succeed in their roles 
loss of key personnel or the inability to hire or retain qualified personnel in the future could have a material adverse effect on our ability to operate successfully 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk our exposure to interest rate risk arises principally from the variable rates associated with our credit facility 
on december   we had borrowings of million under our credit facility which are subject to a variable rate  with a current rate of 
the carrying value of these borrowings approximates fair value due to the variable rate 
an adverse change of in the interest rate of all such borrowings outstanding would cause us to incur an increase in interest expense of approximately  on an annual basis 
we currently do not hedge our exposure to interest rate fluctuations  but may do so in the future 
foreign currency rate fluctuations fluctuations in the rate of exchange between the us dollar and foreign currencies could adversely affect our financial results 
approximately and of our total net sales were denominated in foreign currencies during the years ended december  and  respectively  and we expect that foreign currencies will continue to represent a similarly significant percentage of our net sales in the future 
costs related to these sales are largely denominated in the same respective currencies  thereby limiting our transaction risk exposures 
however  for sales not denominated in us dollars  if there is an increase in the rate at which a foreign currency is exchanged for us dollars  it will require more of the foreign currency to equal a specified amount of us dollars than before the rate increase 
in such cases  and if we price our products in the foreign currency  we will receive less in us dollars than we did before the rate increase went into effect 
if we price our products in us dollars and competitors price their products in local currency  an increase in the relative strength of the us dollar could result in our prices not being competitive in a market where business is transacted in the local currency 
a substantial majority of our sales denominated in foreign currencies are derived from european union countries and are denominated in the euro 
additionally  we have significant intercompany receivables from our foreign subsidiaries which are denominated in foreign currencies  principally the euro and the japanese yen 
our principal exchange rate risk therefore exists between the us dollar and the euro and the us dollar and the yen 
fluctuations from the beginning to the end of any given reporting period result in the revaluation of our foreign currency denominated intercompany receivables and payables  generating currency translation gains or losses that impact our non operating income expense levels in the respective period 
we do not currently hedge our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations 
we may  however  hedge such exposures in the future 
based on our overall exposure for foreign currency at december   an adverse change of in foreign currency rates would reduce our non operating income by approximately
