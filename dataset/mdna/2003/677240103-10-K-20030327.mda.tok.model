item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations ohio casualty corporation the corporation is the holding company of the ohio casualty insurance company the company  which is one of six property casualty companies that make up the ohio casualty group the group 
management s discussion and analysis md a of financial condition and results of operations addresses the financial condition of the corporation and the group as of december   compared with december  and december  and the corporation s and the group s results of operations for each of the three years 
the supplementary financial information should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  all of which are integral parts of the following analysis of the corporation s and the group s results of operations and financial position 
overview during  the group continued to invest in its strategy to improve the ease of use for agents doing business with the group and demonstrated improved loss ratios despite the negative impact of business written in prior years 
the corporation also completed the refinancing of bank debt with a convertible debt issuance that aggregated net proceeds of million as discussed further under liquidity and financial strength 
in addition  substantial progress was made in toward implementing the corporation s strategic plan 
results of operations net income the corporation reported an after tax net loss of 
million  or 
per share for the year  compared with net income of million  or per share in  and a net loss of million  or per share in operating results for the year  the corporation reported a net operating loss of million  compared with net operating losses of million in and million in during  the group increased provisions for prior accident years losses and loss adjustment expenses lae by million before tax which was concentrated in the general liability  commercial auto and personal auto product lines 
also during  operating results were negatively impacted by expenses totaling million before tax related to the agent relationships identifiable intangible asset 
this asset represents the excess of cost over fair value of net assets for the acquisition of the great american insurance company s gai commercial lines division 
the components of this non cash charge were million before tax in amortization and million before tax in impairment charges related to agent cancellations or other changes in estimated future cash flows 
the impairment charges occurred where estimated future cash flows of certain agents were less than the carrying value 
the larger than usual impairment charge in the third quarter of was due primarily to recognition that certain agents experienced sustained premium revenue trends that were significantly different from prior estimates  resulting in changes in estimated future cash flows for those agents 
the determination of impairment involves the use of management estimates and assumptions 
due to the inherent uncertainties and judgments involved in making these assumptions and the fact that the asset cannot be increased for any agent  further reductions in the valuation of the agent relationships asset are operating income loss differs from net income by the exclusion of realized investment gains losses  net of tax 
it is not intended as a substitute for net income prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
item continued likely to occur in the future and could be significant based on uncertainties such as which agents will experience events such as changes in revenue production or profitability 
the total expense of million before tax compares to million before tax in and million before tax in results for the year were negatively impacted by the losses and loss adjustment expenses for prior accident years as described above 
the majority of the charge  million before tax  occurred in the third quarter and was primarily related to construction defect claims for residential developers and contractors 
the group continues to address this specific type of business for non renewal 
for further discussion  refer to the loss and loss adjustment expenses section under liquidity and financial strength 
contributing to the operating loss was the effects of additions to the group s workers compensation product line reserves and asbestos related reserves and the impact of an early retirement plan 
the operating loss included the adverse effects of write downs to the agent relationships intangible asset  additions to reserves  the impact of inadequate pricing and the negative effects of premium cessions on experience rated reinsurance contracts 
positively impacting results was the settlement of the california proposition liability 
during the fourth quarter of  a member of the group  ohio casualty of new jersey  inc ocnj  entered into an agreement to transfer its obligations to renew private passenger auto business in new jersey 
the group decided to eliminate future uncertainty and risks related to the new jersey private passenger automobile market in order to achieve long term strategic objectives 
in  management determined that it was uncertain whether profitability would return as there were indications that some insurance companies were receiving premium rate increase approval from regulators while others were not 
the group s inability to determine the future impact of insurance reform legislation created additional uncertainty 
both premium rate increases and insurance reform legislation might have returned ocnj s private passenger auto business to profitability  but it was uncertain as to if and when that would occur 
the group concluded that it was a prudent business decision to pay a fee to transfer the obligation to renew ocnj s new jersey private passenger auto policies in order to eliminate the future uncertainty associated with that business 
the transaction allowed the group to stop writing business in the new jersey private passenger auto market beginning in march of in recent years  the market in new jersey private passenger auto had become more unstable due to the inability to control both the volume of writings and the profitability 
under the terms of the transaction  ocnj agreed to pay million to a third party  proformance insurance company proformance  to transfer its renewal obligations 
the before tax amount of million was charged to income in the fourth quarter of with payments made over the course of twelve months beginning in early the contract stipulates that a premiums to surplus ratio of to must be maintained on the transferred business during the three year period beginning march the final measurement date is december  and will include use of the statutory insurance expense exhibit which is due april  if this criteria is not met  ocnj will have a contingent liability of up to million to be paid to proformance to maintain this premiums to surplus ratio 
at december   the group has evaluated the contingency based upon financial data provided by proformance 
the group has concluded that it is not probable that the liability will be incurred  and therefore has not recognized a liability in the financial statements 
the group will continue to monitor the contingency for any future liability recognition 
item continued during  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were strengthened by million before tax for the workers compensation product line and million before tax for asbestos related claims development in other product lines 
also in  the corporation adopted an early retirement plan 
of the approximately employees eligible to retire under the program  accepted 
the early retirement plan resulted in a one time after tax charge of million for the year 
in the first quarter of  the group made the decision to discontinue its relationship with all managing general agents 
the business written by the managing general agents was acquired in the purchase of the gai commercial lines division 
the result of the decision was a before tax write down of million to the agent relationships intangible asset 
the asset was also written down in by million before tax as a result of additional agent cancellations for a total write down of million before tax for the year 
in  the corporation further wrote down the agent relationships intangible asset by million before tax as a result of additional agency cancellations and for certain agents determined to be impaired 
the operating results were also impacted negatively by million before tax for ceded premiums on certain experience rated reinsurance contracts covering losses exceeding million 
the premium cessions reflect changes in estimated loss experience  and have resulted in the maximum premium cessions under these contracts for business written through year during  loss and loss adjustment expense reserves were strengthened by million before tax  primarily for the workers compensation and general liability product lines 
investment results consolidated after tax realized investment gains amounted to million in  million in and realized investment losses were million in throughout and the corporation and the group sold equities  many of which had substantially appreciated in earlier periods 
this sale program was part of an investment management decision to reduce equity holdings in favor of investment grade bonds 
the realized gains included a non recurring tax benefit of million related to the sale of a minority interest in stock of ocnj 
consolidated before tax investment income decreased to million in  compared with million in and million in the decrease in investment income of million before tax in was attributable to the significant decline in reinvestment rates on the high quality bonds in which the corporation and the group invest 
this decrease in was partially offset by the reallocation of the equity portfolio in and the reallocation in the investment portfolio reduced equity securities and increased investment grade fixed maturity securities 
the increase in investment income of million before tax in was attributable to the reallocation in the investment portfolio noted above 
also contributing to the increase in before tax investment income in was the reallocation of investments from tax exempt municipal bonds to taxable bonds 
after tax investment income totaled million in  compared with million in and million in during  the corporation and the group realized a loss of approximately million before tax on the sale of bonds issued by enron corporation 
these securities had been purchased in prior periods and were sold both prior and subsequent to enron corporation s filing for bankruptcy in december prior to  these securities were not in an unrealized loss position 
item continued management believes that it will recover the cost basis in the securities held with unrealized losses as it has both the intent and ability to hold the securities until they mature or recover in value 
securities are sold to achieve management s investment goals  which include the diversification of credit risk  the maintenance of adequate portfolio liquidity and the management of interest rate risk 
in order to achieve these goals  sales of investments are based upon current market conditions  liquidity needs and estimates of the future market value of the individual securities 
the largest assets of the corporation and the group are their invested assets 
consequently  accounting policies related to investments are critical 
see further discussion of important investment accounting policies in the critical accounting policies section and in note c 
the corporation and the group continually evaluate all of their investments based on current economic conditions  credit loss experience and other developments 
the corporation and the group evaluate the difference between the cost and estimated fair value of their investments to determine whether a decline in value is temporary or other than temporary in nature 
this determination involves a degree of uncertainty 
if a decline in the fair value of a security is determined to be temporary  the decline is recorded as an unrealized loss in shareholders equity 
if there is a decline in a security s fair value that is considered to be other than temporary  the security is written down to the estimated fair value with a corresponding realized loss recognized in the statement of consolidated income 
the assessment of whether a decline in fair value is considered temporary or other than temporary includes management s judgement as to the financial position and future prospects of the entity issuing the security 
it is not possible to accurately predict when it may be determined that a specific security will become impaired 
future impairment charges could be material to the results of operations of the corporation and the group 
the amount of impairment charge before tax was million in  compared to million and million in and  respectively 
the impairment charge in represents 
of the market value at december  of the investment portfolio  compared to 
in and 
in the following table summarizes the total gross unrealized losses  excluding gross unrealized gains  by investment category as of december in thousands fixed maturities    equities    total unrealized loss    as part of the evaluation of the entire million aggregate unrealized loss on the investment portfolio  management performed a more intensive review of securities with a relatively higher degree of unrealized loss 
in the review for permanently impaired securities as of december   management concluded that of this group of securities with a relatively higher degree of difference between cost and estimated fair value  sixteen securities  with an aggregate unrealized loss of million  were suffering only temporary declines in fair value 
of this unrealized loss amount  million represented unrealized losses in the securities of delta air lines  inc and million represented unrealized losses in investment in amr corporation 
all securities are monitored by portfolio managers who consider many factors such as a company s degree of financial flexibility  management competence and industry fundamentals in evaluating whether the decline in fair value is temporary 
should management subsequently conclude the decline in fair value is other than temporary  the book value of the security is written down to fair value with the realized loss recognized in the statement of consolidated income 
item continued the following table summarizes  for all securities in an unrealized loss position  the gross unrealized loss by length of time the securities have continuously been in an unrealized loss position at december  amortized fair unrealized in thousands cost value loss fixed maturities months    months    greater than months    total    amortized fair unrealized in thousands cost value loss equities months    months    greater than months    total    of the securities in an unrealized loss position as of december   the only material concentration by industry segment was in the airline industry 
the amount of this concentration as of december  was million 
the amortized cost and estimated fair value of debt securities in an unrealized loss position at december   by contractual maturity are shown below 
expected maturities will differ from contractual maturities because borrowers may have the right to call or prepay obligations with or without call or prepayment penalties 
amortized estimated unrealized in thousands cost fair value loss due in one year or less   due after one year through five years    due after five years through ten years    due after ten years    total    reinsurance results the group renewed all of its reinsurance programs for with only moderate changes in the program structure and pricing 
the enactment of the federal terrorism act the act in november has resulted in the federal government acting as a reinsurer on foreign terrorism losses  defined in the act as a certified loss that has been approved by the secretary of treasury 
the group has dedicated resources to ensure compliance with the act 
although the terrorist events of september  had a significant impact on the reinsurance market  the group s reinsurance contracts do include coverage for acts of terrorism 
instead of being item continued unlimited as in the past  terrorism coverage in the contracts was modified to exclude or limit coverage for certain upper layers of reinsurance 
the group believes that the terrorism coverage in its reinsurance programs is adequate to protect its financial health 
the pricing of our reinsurance program increased only moderately from prior years 
the group has renewed its reinsurance programs for except for the bond reinsurance treaty that is expected to be renewed at the april  expiration date 
the program experienced moderate increases in pricing and no significant changes in structure or coverages 
internally developed software in  the group introduced into limited production a new internally developed application for issuing and maintaining insurance policies named paris sm  a policy administration  rating and issuance system 
the group continued the roll out of the new application during to include all product lines in the commercial lines operating segment 
the roll out is currently on target for completion in for the commercial and specialty segments 
the group capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage  primarily relating to payroll and payroll related costs for employees  along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal use software project 
the cost associated with this application is amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of ten years from the date placed into service 
upon full implementation  the new application should impact results by approximately million to million before tax per year in amortization expense until although management believes the carrying value of the asset represents its fair value  the useful life of the internally developed software was determined by using certain assumptions and estimates 
inherent changes in these assumptions could result in an immediate impairment to the asset and a corresponding charge to net income 
statutory results management analyzes statutory results through the use of insurance industry financial measures including statutory loss and loss adjustment expense ratios  statutory underwriting expense ratio  statutory combined ratio  net premiums written and net premiums earned 
the statutory combined ratio is the sum of the statutory loss ratio  the statutory loss adjustment expense ratio  and the statutory underwriting expense ratio 
the statutory combined ratio is a commonly used gauge of underwriting performance measuring the percentages of premium dollars used to pay insurance losses and related expenses 
all references to combined ratio or its components in the md a are calculated on a statutory accounting basis and are calculated on a calendar year basis unless specified on an accident year basis 
the combined ratios and component ratios presented for the year ended december  exclude a million before tax charge for the statutory additional minimum pension liability related to the underfunded status of the retirement plan 
a discussion of the differences between statutory accounting and accounting principles generally accepted in the united states is included in note all lines discussion statutory net premiums written decreased million in to billion 
this slight decline of net premiums written over is primarily attributable to the reduction in premiums related to the non renewal of the group s new jersey private passenger auto business that began to be non renewed in march of net premiums written totaled billion in and billion in the net premiums written decrease in and can be attributed item continued primarily to a more selective underwriting philosophy that led to the elimination and cancellation of certain business and the cancellation of a number of agents 
actions taken in to cancel the managing general agents and the group s most unprofitable agents and policies represented over million in annual net premiums written 
the group s business is geographically concentrated in the mid west and mid atlantic regions 
the following table shows consolidated net premiums written for the group s five largest states all lines net premiums written distributed by top states new jersey ohio pennsylvania kentucky illinois new jersey is the group s largest state with of the total net premiums written during in recent years  new jersey s legislative and regulatory environments for private passenger automobile insurance have become less favorable to the insurance industry 
the state requires insurance companies to accept all risks that meet underwriting guidelines for private passenger automobile while rigidly controlling the rates charged 
in the fourth quarter of  ocnj entered into an agreement to transfer its new jersey private passenger auto renewal obligations to proformance 
this transaction allowed the group to stop writing business in the new jersey private passenger auto and personal umbrella markets in early new jersey private passenger auto made up   and of the group s new jersey net premiums written in   and  respectively 
excluding the group s new jersey private passenger auto net premiums written  new jersey would have represented   and of the total all lines net premiums written in   and the group expects to continue writing all of its other lines of business in the state 
the all lines combined ratio increased 
points to in  compared with in and in the combined ratio of excludes the new jersey transfer fee of million  or point impact 
further excluding new jersey private passenger auto results in total  the combined ratio improved points in to  compared to in the improvement in the combined ratio in over when excluding the million new jersey transfer fee and new jersey private passenger auto business was due primarily to improvement in the personal lines loss ratio 
the personal lines loss ratio improved to from in excluding the new jersey transfer fee and new jersey private passenger auto business 
the improvement in the combined ratio in over was due to improvement in the commercial lines loss ratio and all lines underwriting expense ratio when excluding the million new jersey transfer fee 
the commercial lines loss ratio improved to from in the combined ratio was impacted adversely by increases in the loss and loss adjustment expense ratios 
the loss ratio was impacted by adverse development in the workers compensation and general liability product lines for and prior accident years 
workers compensation added points to the overall loss ratio 
item continued the all lines combined ratio for accident year was 
the all lines combined ratio for the year of reflects losses and lae recorded during for all accident years in aggregate and is therefore points higher than the all lines combined ratio for accident year the all lines combined ratio for accident year is 
points lower than the all lines combined ratio for accident year  excluding the point impact of the new jersey renewal obligation transfer fee  based on accident year data as of december  excluding the impact of new jersey private passenger auto business  the and accident year numbers would have been and  respectively  an improvement of points 
the loss and loss adjustment expense lae ratios  which measure losses and lae as a percentage of net earned premiums  were impacted negatively in by adjustments to estimated losses related to prior years business 
the loss and lae ratio component of the accident year combined ratio measures losses and lae arising from insured events that occurred in the respective accident year 
the current accident year excludes losses and lae for insured events that occurred in prior accident years 
in total  this increase in provisions for prior accident years losses and lae recognized during the year was million before tax 
the table below summarizes the impact of changes in provision for all prior accident year losses and lae in millions including nj private passenger auto statutory net liabilities  beginning of period    increase decrease in provision for prior accident year claims increase decrease in provision for prior accident year claims as of premiums earned the combined ratio impact of this adverse development for prior accident years losses and lae was points for the year for the year  this was concentrated in the general liability and commercial auto product lines of the commercial lines operating segment and in the personal auto product line of the personal lines operating segment 
prior year losses and lae for construction defect related claims were within the range expected for the fourth quarter after recognizing approximately million before tax in the third quarter the total provision for prior years losses and lae of million recognized during the year represents of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as of year end the comparable amount of provision for prior years losses and lae recognized during the year was million before tax representing of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as of year end this was concentrated in the workers compensation product line and the general liability product line of the commercial lines operating segment 
the comparable amount for provisions for prior years losses and loss adjustment expenses recognized during the year was million before tax 
this represents of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves as of year end this was concentrated primarily in the workers compensation and general liability product lines 
the combined ratio includes a reallocation of loss adjustment expense reserve estimates related to claims adjuster salaries  benefits and similar costs from commercial and specialty segments to the personal lines segment 
this increased the personal lines segment combined ratio by points and decreased the commercial lines segment and specialty line segment combined ratio by 
points and  respectively 
item continued at year end  the group reallocated its carried bulk reserves in anticipation of statement of statutory accounting principles no 
under statutory accounting codification  which requires that companies carry their best estimate of loss reserves for each line of business  while previous requirements focused on the overall reserves 
the reallocation did not affect the all lines combined ratio and did not have a material impact on most lines of business other than workers compensation and general liability 
the reallocation added points to the workers compensation combined ratio and reduced the general liability combined ratio by points 
catastrophe losses in totaled million  compared with million in and million in the group was impacted by separate catastrophes in  compared with catastrophes in and in catastrophe losses added points to the combined ratio in  compared with points in and points in the effects of catastrophes on the corporation s results cannot be accurately predicted 
as such  severe weather patterns  acts of war or terrorist activities could have a material adverse impact on the corporation s results  reinsurance pricing and availability of reinsurance 
catastrophe losses  net of reinsurance  for each of the last three years were catastrophe losses before tax dollar impact in millions statutory combined ratio impact the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses as a percentage of net premiums written  decreased by 
points in to  compared with in and in the underwriting expense ratio includes points from the million charge for the new jersey transfer fee 
the underwriting expense ratio for the year increased compared to the year  after excluding the point impact of the new jersey transfer fee  in part due to two factors with a total impact of approximately points 
these two factors were the non renewal of the new jersey private passenger auto business  which had lower commission rates and lower variable processing costs than most other business  and the elimination of ceding commissions received in previous years on umbrella premiums ceded to reinsurers 
the commission expense ratio  a component of the underwriting expense ratio  was or points higher than expected due to higher than expected umbrella net premiums written  which has a relatively high commission rate on a net of reinsurance basis  and more importantly  due to higher than expected accruals for agent bonus commissions  as certain agents were more profitable than expected 
this higher commission expense reflected the improved loss ratio for  which at for the year was a point improvement over the year of 
excluding the new jersey transfer fee  the point improvement in the underwriting expense ratio compared with the ratio in was the result of actions to lower commissions  eliminate workers compensation policyholder dividends and decrease the employee count 
the actions to lower commissions to current market levels for selected product lines improved the underwriting expense ratio 
points 
the actions to eliminate workers compensation policyholders dividends on new and renewal business and changes in reserves for dividends of issued policies improved the underwriting ratio 
points 
reductions in employee count continued to improve results in the employee count was  as of december   compared with  at december  and  at december  item continued the and underwriting expenses also included million and 
million of software amortization expense before tax  respectively  related to the rollout of a new internally developed software application 
on a statutory accounting basis  the new application is being amortized over a five year period in accordance with statutory accounting principles 
for year  the group will substantially complete the rollout of the new application for commercial and specialty segments 
upon full implementation  the impact on statutory expenses is expected to be approximately million to million in annual amortization expense before tax through the additional cost is expected to be offset in part by reduced labor costs related to underwriting and policy processing 
segment discussion in june of  the corporation introduced an organizational structure around three business units commercial lines  specialty lines  and personal lines 
these business units represent the corporation s operating segments as well as its reportable segments 
within each operating segment are distinct insurance product lines that generate revenues by selling a variety of personal  commercial  and surety insurance products 
the commercial lines operating segment sells commercial multiple peril  commercial auto  general liability  and workers compensation insurance as its primary products 
the specialty lines operating segment sells commercial umbrella and bond insurance as its primary products 
the personal lines operating segment sells personal automobile and homeowners insurance as its primary products 
the corporation also has an all other segment  which derives its revenue from investment income and premium financing 
statutory combined ratios by operating segment  accident accident accident including year year year selected major product lines a f f f commercial lines workers compensation auto commercial general liability cmp  fire inland marine specialty lines commercial umbrella fidelity surety personal lines e auto b c homeowners total all lines d a all combined ratios and all component ratios presented for the year exclude million before tax charge for statutory additional minimum pension liability

e accident year and calendar year exclude point impact of new jersey renewal obligation transfer fee 
including the transfer fee  the personal lines accident year and calendar year combined ratios would have been and  respectively 
f the measurement date for accident year data is december  item continued commercial lines segment commercial lines combined ratio for the year decreased points to from in this improvement was not as great as expected due to million of development in loss and loss adjustment expenses from prior years adding points to the combined ratio 
of this amount  approximately million of development from prior years was related to construction defect issues which added points to the combined ratio for the combined ratio was 
renewal price increases had a positive impact during and the average renewal price increase was for the commercial lines direct premiums written  compared with a average renewal price increase in while improving  the workers compensation product line in the commercial lines segment negatively impacted this year s all lines results 
workers compensation combined ratio decreased points in to  compared with and for and  respectively 
the loss ratio was the main component driving the high combined ratio 
the workers compensation loss ratio was  compared with and in and  respectively 
adverse development of prior year losses due to an increase in claims severity contributed to the poor and results 
the accident year loss ratio of was points lower than the calendar year loss ratio  and the accident year loss ratio of is points lower than the calendar year loss ratio 
the poor results in the workers compensation product line in added points to the all lines loss ratio  when including the year end reserve reallocation mentioned in the all lines discussion section 
in response to the deterioration of results  the group took action in to begin non renewing its most unprofitable workers compensation policies 
this business had a loss ratio of approximately points higher than the total workers compensation product line and is referred to as unsupported workers compensation as it is the only product in the customer s account 
as mentioned in the operating results section  the group also took action to discontinue its relationship with managing general agents 
these managing general agents accounted for million in annual workers compensation premium 
the runoff of the unsupported workers compensation business and managing general agent business was substantially completed by the end of the group continued to achieve average renewal price increases for workers compensation of for  compared with increases of and for and  respectively 
net premiums written for  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
due to continued underwriting and pricing actions  workers compensation loss ratios should continue to show improvement 
in  the loss ratio decreased points from accident year claim count for decreased from new and renewal pricing remains strong for this line of business 
the commercial auto product line net premiums written increased million  or in to million  compared with million in and million in the and increase was driven by renewal price increases  averaging and  respectively 
when used in this report  renewal price increase means the average increase in premium for policies renewed by the group 
the average increase in premiums for each renewed policy is calculated by comparing the total expiring premium for the policy with the total renewal premium for the same policy 
renewal price increases include  among other things  the effects of rate increases and changes in the underlying insured exposures of the policy 
only policies issued by the group in the previous policy term with the same policy identification codes are included 
therefore  renewal price increases do not include changes in premiums for newly issued policies and business assumed through reinsurance agreements  including great american business not yet issued in the group s systems 
renewal price increases also do not reflect the cost of any reinsurance purchased on the policies issued 
item continued the commercial auto combined ratio increased to  from in the combined ratio was in the increase in the combined ratio from is due to greater than expected average settlement amounts loss severity from prior years 
the improvement in was largely due to better underwriting and risk selection and the effect of renewal price increases 
the year was hindered by increased severity combined with inadequate pricing 
the accident year loss ratios for this line of business continue to show significant improvement from in to in to in  resulting in accident year combined ratios of in  in and in net premiums written for the commercial multiple peril  fire and inland marine product lines increased to million in  compared with million in and million in the combined ratio decreased to in from in and in the improvement resulted from strong new and renewal pricing and more selective and focused underwriting 
net premiums written for the monoline general liability product line increased million  or in to million  compared with million in and million in the increase is due to higher new and renewal pricing levels 
the decrease reflected the group s focus on fundamental underwriting strategies 
the general liability combined ratio increased points in to  compared with in and in the higher than desired loss ratio is attributable to points of adverse development from prior accident years 
the accident year combined ratio for was 
the difference between the accident and calendar year results is primarily due to increases in residential general contractors and developers related construction defect reserves established for prior accident years in due to greater than expected frequency and loss severity 
the construction defect issues are being addressed by continuing and expanding previous underwriting actions on certain segments that are more prone to construction defect claims 
specialty lines segment specialty lines combined ratio for the year was higher  but still profitable  at  compared with and for and  respectively 
the fidelity surety product lines in the specialty lines segment contributed to the favorable results for the segment 
fidelity surety net premiums written increased million  or in to million  compared with million in and million in the combined ratio was in  compared with in and in during the fourth quarter  there was a return of ceded premium of million before tax for the bond business in the specialty lines operating segment 
this return of ceded premium was due to the exercise of a contractual option on the bond reinsurance treaty based on highly favorable bond combined ratios over the past fourteen years 
net premiums written for the commercial umbrella product line increased million  or in to million  compared with million in and million in the and increases were primarily generated by renewal price increases in  and the average renewal price increase in was  compared with in and in the combined ratio was  compared with in and in although the combined ratio increased  the results were still profitable for the group 
item continued personal lines segment the personal lines combined ratio for the year decreased points to in  compared with in and in excluding the point impact in on personal lines from the reallocation of loss adjustment expense reserve estimates described in the all lines discussion  and excluding the point impact of the new jersey transfer fee in  the personal lines combined ratio would have been for and for this small improvement for is attributable to the implementation of price increases  insurance scoring  enhanced claims management procedures  withdrawal from states that have proven unprofitable to the group s operations  and lower than average losses from catastrophes 
the group continued to narrow its geographic focus in personal lines during the group recently received all necessary approvals from regulators to withdraw its personal lines business from florida  georgia and texas 
the net premiums written in florida  georgia and texas were approximately million 
the group does not write personal lines business in california 
net premiums written for the private passenger auto agency excluding new jersey and direct product line decreased  as expected due to the group s strategy to withdraw from certain states  by million  or to million in  compared with million in and million in selective underwriting and agency cancellations contributed to the decline in premiums in and private passenger auto new jersey and direct net premiums decreased million  or to million in  compared with million in and million in given the unfavorable regulatory environment for private passenger auto in new jersey and uncertainty over the future profitability of the group s private passenger auto business in the state  the group announced in the fourth quarter of the transaction to allow the group in early to stop writing private passenger auto business in new jersey 
the transaction  described in the operating results section  has effectively exited the group from new jersey personal lines auto business in and future years 
new jersey s private passenger auto net premiums written represented approximately of the group s total private passenger auto book of business in  compared to in and in new jersey regulation mandates private passenger automobile insurers in the state to provide insurance to all eligible consumers with limited exceptions 
this take all comers regulation eliminated the group s ability to control the volume and selection of writings in the state 
poor underwriting results in new jersey was the primary cause of the poor performance in and the new jersey private passenger auto results added and points to the and personal lines loss ratio  respectively 
since  new jersey has required insurance companies to write a portion of their personal auto premiums in urban enterprise zones uez 
these zones are generally higher risk urban areas 
companies are also assigned premiums if they do not write the required quota 
in  the group wrote million in uez and assigned premiums  compared with million in uez and assigned premiums in in  the group wrote million in uez and assigned premiums 
excluding the discontinued new jersey business and the impact of the reallocation of loss adjustment expense reserves  the personal lines combined ratio improved points to in  compared to in the group is implementing price increases  coverage restrictions and claims management procedures to improve results 
the group began direct marketing of personal auto coverage in january in  the corporation first restructured its private passenger auto direct product line operations with an internet only strategy  and later discontinued private passenger auto direct in the fourth quarter item continued of the product line was discontinued in order to focus on the independent agency system as the distribution channel for the group 
as a result of the restructuring  net premiums written dropped from million in to million in the group wrote million of net premiums in combined ratios were  and for  and  respectively 
the underwriting expense ratio for the private passenger auto direct product line included million  or points  in expenses for fees for the removal of certain obligations related to assigned private passenger auto policies in new york 
although the group discontinued the private passenger auto direct product line  the group remains committed to expanding its internet capabilities that focus on full service options for our agents and convenience options for our policyholders 
homeowners product line net premiums written fell in to million from million in and million in the group has placed emphasis on price increases  insurance scoring and agency management 
average implemented rate increases were   and in  and  respectively 
the group introduced an insurance to value program in  which addressed underinsured homeowner properties and emphasized adequate replacement cost values 
the homeowners combined ratio decreased points to 
this compares with a combined ratio of in and in combined ratios are heavily impacted by catastrophe losses which added points to the combined ratio in  points in and points in critical accounting policies management of the corporation has identified the policies listed below as significant accounting policies that are critical to the corporation s business operations and influence the consolidated results of operations and financial performance

reserves for loss and loss adjustment expenses the group establishes reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses equal to the estimated amount to settle both reported case reserves and unreported claims incurred but not yet reported 
for reported losses  a case reserve is established within the parameters of coverage provided in the insurance policy 
for ibnr losses  reserves are estimated using established actuarial methods 
an estimate of the loss and loss adjustment expense for each claim is developed using the facts in each case  the group s experience with similar cases  the effects of current developments and anticipated trends 
the methods and assumptions of making such estimates are continually reviewed and updated when considered appropriate 
any resulting adjustments are reflected in the consolidated statements of income for the period in which such estimates are changed 
reserves established in prior years are adjusted as loss experience develops and new information becomes available 
adjustments to previously estimated reserves  both positive and negative  are reflected in the consolidated statements in the periods in which they are made and are referred to as prior period development 
because of the high degree of uncertainty involved in estimating loss and loss adjustment expense reserves  revisions to estimated reserves could have a material impact on the results of operations of the group 
item continued investments all investment securities are classified upon acquisition as held to maturity  trading or available for sale 
at december   all of the corporation s and the group s fixed maturity securities are classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value and may be sold prior to their contractual maturity 
the difference between amortized cost and fair value  net of deferred taxes  is classified as other comprehensive income in the corporation s consolidated statement of shareholders equity 
equity securities are carried at quoted market values and include non redeemable preferred stocks and common stocks 
the difference between cost and quoted market value  net of deferred taxes  is classified as other comprehensive income 
the corporation and the group closely monitor their fixed maturity and equity portfolios for declines in value that are deemed to be other than temporary 
the portfolios are regularly evaluated based on current economic conditions  credit loss experience and other specific developments 
when a decline in value is deemed to be other than temporary  the corporation and the group recognize a realized loss and the security is written down to its estimated fair value 
the corporation and the group follow eitf recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets in accounting for the securitized financial assets rated below aaa and interest only securities  regardless of rating 
upon receipt of payments from such securities  the corporation and the group determine the appropriate amounts of the funds to be allocated as a reduction of principal and interest income 
in making this allocation decision  investment personnel consider such factors as the original estimated average life of the investment  the amount of funds received to date and the timing of future cash flows 
these securities are evaluated for impairment by computing the net present value of expected future cash flows and comparing this to the prior period estimate of expected future cash flows from the security 
when the timing and or amount of cash expected to be received from the security has changed materially and adversely from the previous valuation  the security is considered to be other than temporarily impaired and the amortized cost is written down to the estimated fair value with a realized loss recorded in the consolidated statement of income 
deferred policy acquisition costs the group establishes a deferred asset for costs that vary with and are primarily related to acquiring property or casualty business 
the acquisition costs deferred consist of commissions  brokerage fees  salaries and benefits and other underwriting expenses to include allocations for inspections  taxes  rent and other expenses that vary directly with the acquisition of insurance contracts 
these costs are amortized over the life of the underlying policies 
periodically  an analysis of the asset is performed in relation to the expected recognition of revenues including investment income to determine if any deficiency exists 
no deficiencies have been indicated for the periods presented 
agent relationships the corporation and the group have recorded an asset  which it refers to as agent relationships  for the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired in connection with the gai commercial lines acquisition 
the corporation and the group followed the practice of allocating purchase price to specifically identifiable intangible assets based on their estimated values as determined by appropriate valuation models 
the agent relationships asset is amortized on a straight line basis over an estimated useful life of twenty five years 
the estimated useful life was based on the group s actual experience for agency appointment terms for similar agents  which averaged approximately twenty five years in length 
the asset is evaluated periodically as events item continued or circumstances  such as cancellation of agents  indicate a possible inability to recover their carrying amount 
cancellation of certain agents for reasons such as lack of revenue production or poor quality of business produced does not necessarily change the estimated useful life of remaining agents representing the agent relationships intangible asset 
such evaluation is based on various analyses  including cash flow and profitability projections that incorporate  as applicable  the impact on existing company businesses 
the analyses necessarily involves significant management judgments to evaluate the capacity of an acquired business to perform within projections 
if future undiscounted cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset  an impairment loss is recognized in income in the period in which the future cash flows are identified to be insufficient in comparison to the carrying amount of the asset 
the corporation and the group anticipate that based on future events or circumstances additional write downs for impairment will be made in future periods 
internally developed software in accordance with sop  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use the group capitalizes costs incurred during the application development stage for the development of internal use software 
these costs primarily relate to payroll and payroll related costs for employees along with costs incurred for external consultants who are directly associated with the internal use software project 
costs such as maintenance  training  data conversion  overhead and general and administrative are expensed as incurred 
management believes the expected future cash flows of the asset exceed the carrying value 
the expected future cash flows are determined using various assumptions and estimates 
changes in these assumptions could result in an immediate impairment to the asset and a corresponding charge to net income 
the costs associated with the software are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of ten years commencing when the software is substantially complete and ready for its intended use 
liquidity and financial strength cash flow net cash generated from operations was million in  compared with cash generated of million in and million in the increase in over was due primarily to a reduction in paid losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the increase in cash generated from operations in was also due primarily to a reduction in paid losses and paid loss adjustment expenses 
investing activities used net cash of million in  compared with net cash used of million in and million in total cash used for financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
cash used for financing decreased year over year due to gross proceeds of million received from the convertible debt offering that occurred in the first quarter of which was partially offset by repayment of the previous bank debt 
during  the decrease from prior year was a result of the elimination of shareholder dividends 
overall  total cash used in was million  compared with cash generated of million in and cash used of million in to further strengthen its financial position  the corporation did not pay any shareholder dividends in or  compared with dividend payments of million in quarterly cash dividends per share for were 
for the first quarter and 
for each of the remaining quarters in item continued the corporation is dependent on dividend payments from its insurance subsidiaries in order to meet operating expenses  debt obligations and to pay dividends 
insurance regulatory authorities impose various restrictions and prior approval requirements on the payment of dividends by insurance companies and holding companies 
as of december   approximately million of statutory surplus was not subject to prior dividend approval requirements 
additional restrictions may result from the minimum net worth and surplus requirements in the credit agreement 
the following table presents the corporation s obligations other than obligations relating to its ordinary insurance operations to make future payments under contractual obligations in millions payments due by period less after contractual obligations total than year years years years debt 
operating leases new jersey transfer fee total contractual cash obligations debt as of december   the corporation had million of principal outstanding on debt that includes a million low interest loan with the state of ohio 
during the year  the corporation completed an offering of convertible notes  in an aggregate principal amount of million  due march  and generated net proceeds of million 
the issuance and related costs are being amortized over the life of the notes and are being recorded as related fees 
the liability for debt is reported on the balance sheet net of the unamortized fees 
the corporation uses the effective interest rate method to record the interest and related fee amortization 
interest is payable on march and september of each year  beginning september  the notes may be converted into shares of the corporation s common stock under certain conditions  including if the price per share of the corporation s common stock reaches specific thresholds  if the credit rating of the notes is below a specified level or withdrawn  or if the notes have no credit rating during any period  or if specified corporate transactions have occurred 
the conversion rate is shares per each  principal amount of notes  subject to adjustment in certain circumstances 
if all outstanding notes are converted  the total outstanding common shares would increase by million shares 
the convertible debt impact on earnings per share is based on the if converted method 
the impact on diluted earnings per share is contingent on whether or not certain criteria have been met for conversion 
as of december   the common share price criterion had not been met and  therefore  no adjustment to the number of diluted shares on the earnings per share calculation was made for the convertible debt 
on or after march   the corporation has the option to redeem all or a portion of the notes that have not been previously converted at the following redemption prices expressed as a percentage of principal amount during the twelve redemption months commencing price march  march  march  until maturity of the notes item continued the holders of the notes have the option to require the corporation to purchase all or a portion of their notes on march of  and at of the principal amount of the notes 
in addition  upon a change in control of the corporation occurring anytime prior to maturity  holders may require the corporation to purchase for cash all or a portion of their notes at of the principal amount plus accrued interest 
additionally  on july  the corporation entered into a revolving credit agreement 
under the terms of the credit agreement  the lenders agreed to make loans to the corporation in an aggregate amount up to million for general corporate purposes 
the agreement requires the corporation to maintain minimum net worth of million 
the credit agreement also includes a minimum statutory surplus requirement for the ohio casualty insurance company of million through september   increasing to million thereafter 
additionally  other covenants and customary provisions are included in the agreement 
the credit agreement expires on march  the corporation has not drawn on the revolver as of december  rating agencies regularly the group s financial strength is reviewed by independent rating agencies 
these agencies may upgrade  downgrade  or affirm their previous ratings of the group 
these agencies may also place an outlook on the group s rating 
on march   standard poor s rating services s p removed its negative outlook and placed a stable outlook on the group s bbb financial strength rating 
s p also announced that it assigned its bb senior debt rating on the corporation s convertible notes 
following the corporation s announcement of third quarter results  s p indicated that financial strength rating would be reviewed for possible downgrade  however to date there has been no change

on november   am best company affirmed its financial strength rating of a for the group and maintained its positive outlook 
ohio casualty corporation quarterly high low market price per share first second third fourth high low high low high low item continued statutory surplus statutory surplus  a traditional insurance industry measure of strength and underwriting capacity  was million at december   compared with million at december  and million at december  statutory surplus decreased from resulting from the decline in the market value of its equity investment portfolio offset by statutory income and other surplus changes 
on january   statutory surplus was reduced by million to million for the cumulative effect of adopting new required statutory accounting principles 
the surplus was further reduced by the million after tax charge associated with the new jersey private passenger auto transfer and a decrease in the market value of the equity investment portfolio 
statutory surplus increased in due to the sale of a minority interest in the stock of a subsidiary  which caused a non recurring tax benefit of million 
the ratio of premiums written to statutory surplus is one of the measures used by insurance regulators to gauge the financial strength of an insurance company and indicates the ability of the group to grow by writing additional business 
at december   the group s premiums written to surplus ratio is to  compared to to in and the national association of insurance commissioners naic has developed a risk based capital formula for property and casualty insurers and life insurers 
the formula is intended to measure the adequacy of an insurer s capital given the asset structure and product mix of the company 
as of december   all insurance companies in the group exceeded the necessary capital requirements 
the naic adopted the codification of statutory accounting principles guidance in  which replaced the former accounting practices and procedures manual as the naic s primary guidance on statutory accounting 
the new policies provide guidance for areas where statutory accounting had been silent and changed former statutory accounting in some areas 
the group implemented the codification guidance effective january  the cumulative effect of changes in accounting principles adopted to conform to the codification guidance were reported as an adjustment to statutory policyholders surplus as of january  the cumulative effect of adopting codification reduced statutory policyholders surplus by million on january  reinsurance reinsurance is a contract by which one insurer  called a reinsurer  agrees to cover  under certain defined circumstances  a portion of the losses incurred by a primary insurer in the event a claim is made under a policy issued by the primary insurer 
the group purchases reinsurance to protect against large or catastrophic losses 
there are several programs that provide reinsurance coverage and the programs in effect for are summarized below 
the group s property per risk program covers property losses in excess of million for a single insured  for a single event 
this property per risk program covers up to million in losses in excess of the million retention level for a single event 
the group s casualty per occurrence program covers liability losses 
workers compensation  umbrella and other casualty reinsurance cover losses up to million  million and million  respectively  in excess of the million retention level for a single insured event 
the casualty reinsurance treaty includes a layer of coverage of million in excess of million that includes a fund managed by the group and the group has title to the assets 
ceded premiums are paid into the item continued fund and reinsured losses are paid to the group under the terms of the reinsurance agreement with various reinsurers 
the reinsurers bear the risk of losses in excess of the fund 
the group s ability to manage the investments of the fund reduces credit risk related to reinsurers 
the balance of the fund as of december  was approximately million 
the property catastrophe reinsurance program protects the group against an accumulation of losses arising from one defined catastrophic occurrence or series of events 
this program provides million of coverage in excess of the group s million retention level 
the treaty was written on a multiple year basis for years with only a portion of the reinsurance layers expiring in a single year 
this provides continuity and maintains rates and each reinsurer s overall share of the program 
over the last years  two events triggered coverage under the catastrophe reinsurance program 
losses and loss adjustment expenses from the fires in oakland  california in totaled million and losses and loss adjustment expenses from hurricane andrew in totaled million 
both of these losses exceeded the prior retention amount of million  resulting in significant recoveries from reinsurers 
reinsurance limits are purchased to cover exposure to catastrophic events having the probability of occurring every years 
gai agreed to maintain reinsurance on the commercial lines business that the group acquired from gai and its affiliates in for loss dates prior to december  gai is obligated to reimburse the group if gai s reinsurers are unable to pay claims with respect to the acquired commercial lines business 
reinsurance contracts do not relieve the group of their obligations to policyholders 
the collectibility of reinsurance depends on the solvency of the reinsurers at the time any claims are presented 
the group monitors each reinsurer s financial health and claims settlement performance because reinsurance protection is an important component of the corporation s financial plan 
each year  the group reviews financial statements and calculates various ratios used to identify reinsurers who no longer meet appropriate standards of financial strength 
reinsurers who fail these tests are reviewed and those that are determined by the group to have insufficient financial strength are removed from the program at renewal 
additionally  a large base of reinsurers is utilized to mitigate concentration of risk 
the group also records an estimated allowance for uncollectible reinsurance amounts as deemed necessary 
during the last three fiscal years  no reinsurer accounted for more than of total ceded premiums 
as a result of these controls  amounts of uncollectible reinsurance have not been significant 
loss and loss adjustment expenses the group s largest liabilities are reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
the accounting policies related to the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are considered critical 
loss and loss adjustment expense reserves are established for all incurred claims and are carried on an undiscounted basis before any credits for reinsurance recoverable 
actual losses and loss adjustment expenses may change with further developments 
these reserves amounted to billion at december   billion at december  and billion at december  as of december   the reserves by operating segment were as follows billion commercial lines  
billion specialty lines and 
billion personal lines 
the group s actuaries conduct a reserve study using generally accepted actuarial methods each quarter from which point estimates of ultimate losses and loss adjustment expenses by product line or coverage within product line are selected 
in selecting the point estimates  thousands of data points are reviewed and the judgment of the actuaries is applied broadly 
each quarter item continued management records its best estimate of the liability for loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by considering the actuaries point estimates 
management s best estimate recognizes that there is uncertainty underlying the actuarial point estimates 
reasonable range estimates around the point estimates are used by management to validate its best estimate of the liability 
there are several key assumptions supporting the point estimate including those summarized below 
the fundamental assumption is that actuarial reserving methods  using historical loss experience organized by line of business  or coverage within line  and accident year at successive evaluation points  applied by experienced reserving actuaries  produces reasonable estimates of future loss development on prior insured events 
supporting assumptions internal to company operations are as follows recording of premium and loss statistics in the appropriate detail has been accurate and consistent  claims handling  including the recording of claims  payment and closure rates  and case reserving has been consistent  the quality of business written and the mix of business eg states  limits  coverages  and deductibles have been consistent  rate changes and changes in policy provisions have been measured accurately  reinsurance coverage has been consistent and reinsured losses are collectible 
to the extent any of the above factors have changed over time  attempts must be made to quantify and adjust for the changes 
supporting assumptions related to the external environment are as follows tort law and the legal environment have been consistent  coverage interpretation by the courts has been consistent  regulations regarding coverage provisions have been consistent  loss inflation has been relatively steady 
to the extent any of the above factors have changed over time  attempts must be made to quantify and adjust for the changes 
the more the inconsistency  the greater the uncertainty of the loss reserve estimates 
the group has three categories of loss and loss adjustment expense reserves that it considers highly uncertain  and therefore  could have a material impact on future financial results and financial position asbestos and environmental liability exposures  construction defect exposures  and excess capacity liability exposures 
these categories are described below with relevant historical data 
in recent years  asbestos and environmental liability claims have expanded greatly in the insurance industry 
historically  the group has written small commercial accounts and has not sold policies with significant manufacturing liability coverages 
within the manufacturing category  the group has concentrated on the light manufacturers  which further limits exposure to environmental claims 
consequently  the group believes it does not have exposure to the primary defendants involved in major asbestos litigation 
the group s exposure to asbestos is related to installers and distributors as opposed to the large manufacturers 
in  the group increased reserves because of the expansion of litigation to these types of business 
a significant part of the group s exposure to environmental liability is related to underground storage tanks 
the group has limited exposures to the national priority list 
in the group re classified approximately million of homeowners reserves related to underground storage tanks as environmental reserves 
due to the relatively small exposure to asbestos and environmental liability and the unique nature of this exposure  the group does not rely on claim count data in determining reserves 
for  and  respectively  the asbestos and environmental reserves  net of reinsurance  were million  million and million 
asbestos reserves were million  million and million and environmental reserves were million  million and million for those respective years 
item continued the group defines construction defect exposure as liability for allegations of defective work and completed operations losses from general liability  commercial multiple peril liability and umbrella liability policies involving multiple units condos townhouses apartments tracts of single family homes  multiple defendants eg developers  sub contractors  usually with multiple defect issues  and often involving multiple insurance carriers 
the group excludes from the definition claims related to individual single family homes  apartments townhomes or other residential properties if the defect issues are limited in scope and volume 
the number of construction defect claims reported in  and  respectively  were  and the paid losses  net of reinsurance  in were million  compared to million in and million in the paid allocated loss adjustment expenses  net of reinsurance  for construction defect claims were million in  compared with million in and million in these totals exclude construction defect losses from the state of california 
although the group has construction defect losses from california exposure  it excludes california from this data because the group stopped writing in the state in and the remaining claims are minimal and of a different nature than our exposure in the rest of the country 
this data also includes claims assumed from the gai acquisition beginning in november  slightly distorting the numbers 
the group writes excess capacity liability business with large policy limits that are heavily reinsured 
there have been very few losses to date on this business  but the large policy limits increase the uncertainty of future losses before the application of reinsurance 
there is a relatively small amount of loss data available for this business 
the group s coverage for approximately three fourths of this business written during begins when losses or loss adjustment expenses on an individual claim reaches million or more 
the group s limit of coverage on an individual claim for approximately two thirds of this business written during is million 
reinsurance purchased by the group limits its retention of losses to million 
during  the group wrote approximately  of these excess capacity liability policies  representing an annual growth of approximately since results for the year were negatively impacted by losses and loss adjustment expenses for prior accident years totaling million before tax on an all lines basis 
for the commercial lines operating segment  the losses and loss adjustment expenses for prior accident years recorded during were million before tax and were concentrated in the general liability  commercial automobile and workers compensation product lines 
comparable commercial lines amounts for and were million and approximately million  respectively 
in both and  this was concentrated in the workers compensation and general liability product lines 
the amount included the commercial umbrella product line as it was combined with the general liability product line at that time for purposes of accident year analyses 
for the specialty lines operating segment  the losses and loss adjustment expenses for prior accident years recorded during was million and was concentrated in the commercial umbrella product line 
comparable amounts for and were million and approximately million  respectively 
in  this was concentrated in the commercial umbrella product line 
for  the favorable development was from the bond product line 
for  the commercial umbrella product line was included with the general liability product line in accident year analyses 
item continued for the personal lines operating segment there was million losses or loss adjustment expenses for prior accident years recorded during comparable amounts for and were million and approximately million  respectively 
in  this was concentrated in the homeowners product line 
in  favorable development occurred in the personal automobile product line 
the losses and loss adjustment expenses on prior accident years totaling million reflect an update to estimates for reserves based on new information during the year  resulting in recognition during each quarter during through a thorough loss reserve study was conducted using data and other information updated and available as of the end of each quarter 
based on these studies  liabilities for loss and loss adjustment expenses are established for the estimated ultimate costs of settling claims for insured events  for both reported claims and incurred but not reported claims 
as more information becomes available and claims are settled in subsequent periods  the estimated liabilities are adjusted upward or downward 
for each reserve study  several generally accepted actuarial reserving techniques were applied to determine estimates of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense by product line by accident year 
for each accident year and product line  two or more estimates of ultimate loss were determined and a final estimate was selected 
key assumptions were applied consistently during through the reserve study of third quarter revealed the average severity loss per claim and the amount of legal expense for certain types of construction defect claims that were much greater than previously seen or anticipated 
the study also indicated that more of these severe claims had been reported and were expected to be reported in the future than previously anticipated  despite a decrease in frequency of other types of general liability claims 
it was concluded that these construction defect claims impacted the general liability  commercial multiple peril and commercial umbrella product lines 
as a result of this third quarter review  the estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense for this exposure was increased 
for these three product lines combined  the impact of construction defect in the year was million before tax 
the loss estimates for these claims are based on currently available information 
however  given the expansion of coverage and liability by the courts and legislatures  there is substantial uncertainty as to the ultimate liability 
the year also experienced greater than expected loss activity from older accident years for the commercial automobile product line 
this was due to greater than expected severity on bodily injury claims 
as a result  the estimate of ultimate loss and loss adjustment expense was increased by million 
reserve development in the year occurred as follows million for accident year  million for accident year  million for accident year  and million for accident years and prior 
reserve development in the year occurred as follows million for accident year  million for accident year and million for accident years and prior 
reserve development in the year occurred by accident year as follows million for accident year and for accident years and prior 
the amount of the loss and loss adjustment expense reserves by accident year at the beginning of was million for accident year  million for accident year  and million for accident year item continued losses and loss adjustment expenses for prior accident years were recognized during the year due to new information that caused a revision to prior estimates for loss and loss reserves as described above 
there is considerable uncertainty in these estimates for reasons such as the external environment including coverage litigation  judicial decisions  legislative changes  claimants and juries attitudes with respect to settlements  claim frequency and severity  the emergence of unusual types or sizes of claims  changes in underwriting quality of the book of business over time  and changes in claims handling which affects the payment rate or case reserve adequacy 
because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating ultimate costs of claims  actual loss and loss adjustment expenses may deviate substantially from the amounts recorded 
furthermore  the timing  frequency and extent of adjustments to the estimated liabilities cannot be predicted since conditions and events which established historical loss and loss adjustment expense development and which serve as the basis for estimating ultimate claim cost may not occur in exactly the same manner  if at all 
investment portfolio at year end  consolidated investments had a carrying value of billion 
the excess of market value over cost was million  compared with million at year end and million at year end the decrease in and was largely due to the recognition of realized gains in connection with the sale of appreciated equity securities and declines in the market value of certain equity securities 
the reduction in unrealized gains related to equity securities in was somewhat offset by an increase in unrealized gains in the fixed maturity portfolio of million 
the consolidated fixed maturity portfolio of the corporation and the group has an intermediate duration and a laddered maturity structure 
the corporation and the group always remain fully invested and do not time markets 
the corporation and the group also have no off balance sheet investments or arrangements as defined by section a of the sarbanes oxley act of tax exempt bonds increased  as a percentage of amortized cost  to of the fixed maturity portfolio at year end versus at december  this increase reflects a decision at the end of to add to municipal holdings in anticipation of improved underwriting results and to take advantage of unique municipal market opportunities 
at december   the tax exempt bonds represented of the amortized cost of the consolidated fixed maturity portfolios 
due to poor underwriting results over the past few years  the corporation and the group had reduced their holdings of tax exempt municipal bonds in and to maximize after tax income 
as of december   the corporation and the group held  in mortgage backed securities  compared with  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
the majority of mortgage backed security holdings are in sequential structures  planned amortization class and agency pass through securities 
of this portfolio  million  million and million were invested in more volatile bond classes eg interest only securities which do not return principal at maturity  super floater securities which pay interest at a formula rate that is a function of libor and inverse floater securities which pay interest per a formula that adjusts inversely to changes in libor rates in  and  respectively 
item continued the investment portfolio of the corporation and the group include non publicly traded securities such as private placements  non exchange traded equities and limited partnerships which are carried at fair value 
fair values are based on valuations from pricing services  brokers and other methods as determined by management to give the most accurate price 
the carrying value of this portfolio at december  was million 
this compares to million in and million in at december   the fixed maturity portfolio included non investment grade securities and non rated securities that had a fair value of and comprised of the investment portfolio 
this compares to a fair value of million and million at december  and  respectively 
these securities comprised and of the investment portfolio at december  and  respectively 
following is a table displaying non investment grade and non rated securities in an unrealized loss position at december amortized fair unrealized cost value loss at year end  consolidated equity investments had a market value of million 
equity investments have decreased  as a percentage of market value of the consolidated portfolio  from at year end to at year end this decrease is primarily attributable to the corporation s and the group s and actions which reduced assets invested in equities 
the corporation and the group use assumptions and estimates when valuing certain investments and related income 
these assumptions include estimations of cash flows and interest rates 
although the corporation and the group believe the values of its investments represent fair value  certain estimates could change and lead to changes in fair values due to the inherent uncertainties and judgements involved with accounting measurements 
forward looking statements ohio casualty corporation publishes forward looking statements relating to such matters as anticipated financial performance  business prospects and plans  regulatory developments and similar matters 
the statements contained in this management s discussion and analysis that are not historical information  are forward looking statements 
the private securities litigation reform act of provides a safe harbor under the securities act of and the securities exchange act of for forward looking statements 
the operations  performance and development of the corporation s business are subject to risks and uncertainties which may cause actual results to differ materially from those contained in or supported by the forward looking statements 
the risks and uncertainties that may affect the operations  performance  development and results of the corporation s business include the following changes in property and casualty reserves  catastrophe losses  premium and investment growth  product pricing environment  availability of credit  changes in government regulation  performance of financial markets  fluctuations in interest rates  availability and pricing of reinsurance  litigation and administrative proceedings  rating agency actions  acts of war and terrorist activities  ability of ohio casualty to retain business acquired from the great american insurance company  ability to achieve targeted expense savings  changes in estimated future cash flows and related impairment charges for the agent relationships intangible asset  ability to achieve premium targets and profitability goals  and general economic and market conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk disclosures for financial instruments market risk is the risk of loss resulting from adverse changes in interest rates 
in addition to market risk  the corporation and the group are exposed to other risks such as equity price risk  credit  reinvestment and liquidity risk 
credit risk refers to the financial risk that an obligation will not be paid and a loss will result 
reinvestment risk is the risk that interest rates will fall causing the reinvestment of interim cash flows to earn less than the original investment 
liquidity risk describes the ease with which an investment can be sold without substantially affecting the asset s price 
the sensitivity analysis below summarizes only the exposure to market risk and equity price risk 
the corporation and the group strive to produce competitive returns by investing in a diversified portfolio of securities issued by high quality companies 
market risk the corporation and the group have exposure to losses resulting from potential volatility in interest rates 
the corporation and the group attempt to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk through active portfolio management  periodic reviews of asset and liability positions and through maintaining a laddered maturity bond portfolio with an intermediate duration 
estimates of cash flows and the impact of interest rate fluctuations relating to the corporation s and the group s fixed maturity investment portfolios are modeled quarterly and reviewed regularly 
equity price risk equity price risk can be separated into two elements 
the first  systematic risk  is the portion of a portfolio or individual security s price movement attributed to stock market movement as a whole 
the second element  nonsystematic risk  is the portion of price movement unique to the individual portfolio or security 
this risk can be further divided between characteristics of the industry and of the individual issuer 
the corporation and the group attempt to manage nonsystematic risk by maintaining a portfolio that is diversified across industries 
the following tables illustrate the hypothetical effect of an increase in interest rates of basis points and a decrease in equity values at december   and  respectively 
the changes selected above reflect the corporation s and the group s view of shifts in rates and values that are quite possible over a one year period 
these rates should not be considered a prediction of future events 
interest rates may  in fact  be much more volatile in the future 
this analysis is not intended to provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in interest rates and equity prices on the corporation s and the group s income  cash flow or shareholders equity 
in addition  the analysis does not take into account any actions the corporation or the group may take to reduce its exposure in response to market fluctuations

the corporation and the group assume an instantaneous and parallel shift in interest rates and a simultaneous decline of in equity prices at december   and also  the corporation and the group assume the change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across all financial instruments 
the adjusted market values are estimated using discounted cash flow analysis and duration modeling
