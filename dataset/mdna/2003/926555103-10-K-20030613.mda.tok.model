the company is the primary supplier of replacement television crts to the domestic entertainment market 
a majority of the entertainment segment s sales are to major television retailers as replacements for products sold under manufacturer and extended warranties 
due to continued lower retail sales prices for mid size television sets to  fewer extended warranties are sold by retailers  a trend consistent with the past two fiscal years 
the company remains the primary supplier of the manufacturer s standard warranties 
growth in this division will be impacted by the timing and number of extended warranties sold for the larger  more expensive sets 
due to the fact that the company is in the replacement market  it has the ability to track retail sales trends and  accordingly  can attempt to adjust quantities of certain size crts carried in stock and reduce the exposure to obsolescence 
in fiscal  retail trends continued to indicate increased sales in the mid to larger size television sets 
flat panel technology has not had a significant impact on the television replacement market 
most of the flat panel units sold within the television market are for commercial usage rather than end user consumer usage 
within the data display and monitor sub segments  there has been an impact by flat panel technology 
the company has converted manufacturing of certain subsidiaries within these sub segments to produce flat panel products

as a result of declining market conditions  management shut down the monochrome crt manufacturing operations closure of mexican operations and began sourcing these products from overseas suppliers 
the increase in the wholesale consumer parts segment of  is attributed primarily to the additions of the applica  inc applica and norelco distribution agreement revenues 
these agreements authorize fox international to distribute parts and accessories for applica s black decker  profinish  quick easy  and spacemaker product lines and for norelco s product lines 
sales generated pursuant to these agreements were approximately  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
these increases were offset by decreases of approximately  in consumer retail sales  which have been negatively impacted by general economic conditions 
gross margins consolidated gross profit margins decreased from to for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  crt segment margins decreased from to and the wholesale electronic parts segment margins increased from to 
the primary factors for the decline of crt margins were third quarter write downs and write offs of inventories and manufacturing equipment in the amount of  related to the closing of operations in mexico  wolcott  megascan and aydin uk 
these locations  which during the past few years had experienced reduced sales volume  lower margins due to aging product lines with limited potential for future product development and high overhead were part of an internal restructuring of operations 
other locations within the company with excess capacity and newer  complementary product lines were determined to be the successors of these related customer bases 
as such  certain raw materials inventories and equipment used in the manufacturing process of these closed locations were written down or off as the company has been able to more affordably source these products from overseas vendors or to shift the processes to more efficient locations within the company 
management determined it cost prohibitive to physically transfer the related materials and equipment to other company locations 
included in the above charge to cost of sales in the third quarter of fiscal was a write down of  which reflects the carrying cost of inventories previously manufactured by the mexican operation to current net realizable value as well as the write off of older or large quantity stocks 
the remainder of the decline in crt margins is attributed in part to decreases in margins within the monitor sub segment 
display systems margins declined due to the fact that products sold in the previous year included bulk inventories acquired at significantly reduced costs related to the acquisition of the marquee product line in the third quarter of fiscal as these inventories have been sold  replacement items have been purchased at current market costs and  thus  have increased the cost of items produced 
the increase in the wholesale consumer parts segment margins is largely attributable to the applica and norelco distribution agreements 
the revenues associated with these agreements include primarily handling charges and shipping income  which accounts for an approximately profit margin before the effects of offsetting operating expenses 
operating expenses operating expenses as a percentage of sales increased from for the year ended february  to for the year ended february  the crt segment operating expenses increased  for the year ended february  as compared to a year ago

operating expenses increased by  compared to the prior year at display systems in order to handle the increased business generated from the christie marquee product line acquired in fiscal based on expected increased sales volume  it is anticipated that these costs will continue to increase slightly in the near term and then stabilize as sales level out 
additionally  there were increased operating costs associated with the closure of the mexican operations including severance payments  as required by mexican law of  which were paid during the third and fourth quarters of the increases were offset by reductions to operating expenses of  related to the locations closed during the year 
additionally  the company adopted sfas no 
at the beginning of fiscal and  accordingly  ceased amortization of goodwill at that time 
goodwill amortization expense was  for the year ended february  the wholesale parts segment operating expenses were up  for the year ended february  as compared to a year ago  but as a percentage of sales decreased from to 
the increase includes  related to increases in delivery  labor and commission expenses associated with the applica and norelco revenue increases 
offsetting decreases of  were experienced in various operating expense line items 
the delivery and commission expenses related to the applica and norelco lines are a function of sales volume 
as sales increase it is expected that these costs will increase as well

interest expense interest expense decreased  for the year ended february  as compared to february  the company maintains various debt agreements with different interest rates  most of which are based on the prime rate or libor 
libor and prime rates were slightly lower during the comparable periods 
while overall debt decreased during the twelve month comparative periods by  the mix of interest rates changed

the monitor division increased  or  data display crt sales increased  or  entertainment crt sales decreased  or  and the electron gun component parts segment decreased  or 
the increase in monitor division sales was impacted in several ways

the decline in the wholesale consumer parts segment of  is attributed primarily to the decline in consumer retail sales during the comparative periods 
sales to larger distributors have declined slightly as well 
general economic conditions have had a direct  negative impact on this segment 
to help offset these declines  fox international signed a distribution agreement in fiscal with applica  inc applica  authorizing fox international to distribute parts and accessories for applica s black decker toaster oven  profinish  quick easy  and spacemaker product lines 
sales earned pursuant to this agreement were  in fiscal gross margins consolidated gross margins increased from to for the year ended february  as compared to the year ended february  crt division margins increased from to and wholesale electronic parts division margins increased from to for the same comparative period

additionally  when fox international acquired the black decker distribution agreement with applica  there were outstanding coupon offers the company had to honor that included free shipping 
the segment s delivery expense increased  despite an overall decrease in sales 
the company believes that the majority of these coupons have been utilized and  going forward  that fox international will be able to charge its customers for shipping costs related to this product line

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
these financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these principles require the use of estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and related notes 
the accounting policies that may involve a higher degree of judgments  estimates  and complexity include reserves on inventories  the allowance for bad debts and warranty reserves 
the company uses the following methods and assumptions in determining its estimates reserves on inventories reserves on inventories result in a charge to operations when the estimated net realizable value declines below cost 
management regularly reviews the company s investment in inventories for declines in value and establishes reserves when it is apparent that the expected realizable value of the inventory falls below its original cost 
the age of the inventory is not as significant as is the projected demand for crts 
management is able to identify consumer buying trends  such as size and application  well in advance of supplying replacement crts 
thus  the company is able to adjust inventory stocking levels according to the projected demand 
the average life of a crt is five to seven years  at which time the company s replacement market develops 
management is also able to observe the production trends of the oems and the new products that are being promoted 
the company wrote off approximately  of inventory in fiscal related to changing market conditions affecting mexican operations  and the aydin uk  vdc wolcott and megascan businesses 
aydin uk  wolcott and megascan had experienced weak returns and management expected limited potential for future product development on a stand alone basis 
another component of the fiscal write down was the disposal of older or large quantity stocks that management determined had limited future salability 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence was approximately  and  at february  and  respectively 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized when goods are shipped 
the company does not offer rights of return to customers  however  it does offer one and two year limited warranties on certain products 
revenue from contracts that are long term in nature is recognized by the percentage of completion method 
profit estimates are revised periodically based upon actual costs incurred 
any expected losses identified on contracts are recognized immediately 
revenue related to short term contracts is recognized upon shipment of product  which is typically mandated by set delivery dates in the related contract 
allowance for bad debts the allowance is determined by reviewing known customer exposures and applying historical credit loss experience to the current receivable portfolio with consideration given to the current condition of the economy  assessment of the financial position of the creditors and overall trends in past due accounts compared to established thresholds 
the company monitors credit exposure and assesses the adequacy of the allowance for bad debts on a regular basis 
management reviews the valuation of accounts receivable on a monthly basis 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is estimated based on historical experience of write offs and current economic conditions that might impact the collectibility of customer accounts  including such factors as bankruptcies and insolvencies 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers 
the company continually updates the history it uses to make these estimates so as to reflect the most recent information available 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was approximately  and  at february  and  respectively 
warranty reserves warranty reserves are determined by recording a specific reserve for known warranty issues and a general reserve based on historical claims experience 
actual claims incurred could differ from the original estimates  requiring adjustments to the reserve 
use of estimates management s review of these accounting items and the resulting accounting positions taken by the company are based upon certain assumptions and conditions and reflect management s best assumptions and estimates  however  estimates of these types of accounting items involve inherent uncertainties as described above  that are beyond management s control 
the company incorporates many years of historical data into the determination of each of these estimates 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
other accounting policies other loss contingencies are recorded as liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss is reasonably estimable 
disclosure is required when there is a reasonable possibility that the ultimate loss will exceed the recorded provision 
contingent liabilities are often resolved over long time periods 
estimating probable losses requires analysis of multiple forecasts that often depend on judgments about potential actions by third parties 
other significant accounting policies  not involving the same level of measurement uncertainties as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of the financial statements 
policies related to the impairment of long lived assets require difficult judgments on matters that are often subject to multiple sources of authoritative accounting guidance 
see also note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies  which discusses accounting policies that must be selected by management when there are acceptable alternatives 
forward looking information this report contains forward looking statements and information that is based on management s beliefs  as well as assumptions made by  and information currently available to management 
when used in this document  the words anticipate  believe  estimate  intends  will  and expect and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following business conditions  rapid or unexpected technological changes  product development  inventory risks due to shifts in product demand  competition  domestic and foreign government relations  fluctuations in foreign exchange rates  rising costs for components or unavailability of components  the timing of orders booked  lender relationships  and the risk factors listed from time to time in the company s reports filed with the commission 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued sfas no  goodwill and other intangible assets

the company adopted sfas no 
on march  and  accordingly  ceased amortization of goodwill at that time 
goodwill amortization expense of  and  was included in the consolidated financial statements for the years ended february  and  respectively

in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no 

sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no

the transition provisions of sfas no 
are effective in fiscal years beginning after december  the company is currently evaluating the transition provisions of sfas no 
but expects that it will not have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations upon adoption since the company has not adopted the fair value method 
the company adopted the required disclosure provisions of sfas no 
 see note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees and indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also requires that a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   while the provisions of the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual reports ending after december  the company adopted the disclosure provisions of fin during the fourth quarter of fiscal and such adoption did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the recognition provisions of fin are not expected to have a material adverse impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to other entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
since the company currently has identified no variable interest entities  management expects that the adoption of the provisions of fin will not have a material impact on the company s consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in may  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
requires three types of freestanding financial instruments to be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
one type is mandatorily redeemable shares  which the issuing company is obligated to buy back in exchange for cash or other assets 
a second type  which includes put options and forward purchase contracts  involves instruments that do or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets 
the third type of instrument is obligations that can be settled with shares  the monetary value of which is fixed  tied solely or predominately to a variable such as a market index  or varies inversely with the value of the issuer s shares 
the majority of the guidance in sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  in accordance with sfas no 
 the company plans to adopt this standard on september  during fiscal  the company issued  of redeemable common stock in exchange for inventory 
at the option of the holder  the stock was redeemable at the end of one year for  cash 
subsequent to february   the holder exercised his option and redeemed approximately  shares for  adoption of sfas no 
by the company on september  is not expected to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position and results of operations 
impact of inflation inflation has not had a material effect on the company s results of operations to date 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary market risks include fluctuations in interest rates and variability in interest rate spread relationships  such as prime to libor spreads 
approximately  of outstanding debt at february  related to long term indebtedness under variable rate debt 
interest on the outstanding balance of this debt will be charged based on a variable rate related to the prime rate or the libor rate 
both rate bases are incremented for margins specified in their agreements 
thus  the company s interest rate is subject to market risk in the form of fluctuations in interest rates 
the effect of a hypothetical one percentage point increase across all maturities of variable rate debt would result in an decrease of approximately  in pre tax net income assuming no further changes in the amount of borrowings subject to variable rate interest from amounts outstanding at february  the company does not trade in derivative financial instruments 
the company has a subsidiary in the uk  which is not material  but uses the british pound as its functional currency 
due to its limited operations outside of the us  the company s exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies or to weakening economic conditions in foreign markets is not expected to significantly effect the company s financial position 
beginning january   the company reported its former mexican subsidiary on the basis of the functional currency being the us dollar as over of the subsidiary s sales and purchases were with the parent with accounts receivable and accounts payable settled in us dollars 
due to the closure of the mexican subsidiary in the fourth quarter of fiscal  cumulative foreign currency translation losses of  previously included as a separate component of shareholders equity were recognized in operating expense 
these translation losses accumulated prior to january   when the functional currency of this subsidiary was the mexican peso
