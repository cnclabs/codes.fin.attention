the decrease in air travel  especially long haul flights from the east coast  affected riviera las vegas more than many of its competitors 
the company s marketing efforts had been concentrated on airline customers who traveled longer distances  paid more for their tickets and had a larger gaming and entertainment budget 
while this strategy was successful in prior years  the effects of the september  terrorist attacks were devastating to this market segment 
subsequent to september   gaming marketing expenditures were increased to protect and promote the slot customer base 
increased room marketing efforts focus on customers in the western united states and these efforts appear to be successful  based on the pace of advance bookings

riviera black hawk special factors affecting comparability of results of operations riviera black hawk was in the development stage during and until february  when the casino opened 
accordingly  the consolidated results of operations for fiscal and may not be comparable

other expenses  net  include an insurance reimbursement of paulson litigation costs of million in net loss the consolidated net loss increased approximately million from million in to million in the effective income tax benefit rates decreased from in to in because of permanent timing differences for certain travel and entertainment expenses  along with adjustments for tax credits which were considered deductions in prior years 
ebitda consolidated ebitda  as defined  decreased approximately million  or  from million in to million in during the same periods  ebitda margin decreased from to of net revenues 
liquidity and capital resources the company had cash and short term investments of million at december   which was a decrease of million from  which is mainly due to the costs associated with the extinguishment of debt 
cash balances include amounts that could be required to fund the chairman s pension obligation in a rabbi trust with five days notice 
see note to the financial statements  other long term liabilities 
effective april   the company will begin paying mr 
westerman  per quarter from his pension plan 
in exchange for these payments  mr 
westerman has agreed to continue his forbearance of his right to receive full transfer of his pension fund balance to the rabbi trust 
this does not limit his ability to give the five day notice at anytime 
although there is no current intention to require additional funding  under certain circumstances  approximately million might have to be disbursed in a short period 
for  the company s net cash provided by operating activities was million compared to million in due primarily to the payment of interest to defease the old bonds and the loss from operations 
cash flow used in investing activities was million in compared to million in due to the decrease in capital expenditures 
net cash used in financing was million in and million in  primarily due to the costs of refinancing our debt 
ebitda  as defined  for and was million and million  respectively 
management believes that cash flow from operations  combined with the million cash and the million senior secured credit facility discussed below  will be sufficient to cover the company s debt service and enable investment in budgeted capital expenditures of million for the next twelve months 
on june   the company secured new debt in the principal amount of million in the form of senior secured notes with a maturity date of june  substantially all of which were later exchanged for sec registered notes having substantially the same terms the notes 
interest on the notes is at the annual rate of paid semiannually on each june and december  beginning december  the net proceeds of the notes  along with cash on hand  were used to defease riviera las vegas first mortgage notes due and to defease riviera black hawk s first mortgage notes with contingent interest due cash flow from operations is not expected to be sufficient to pay of the principal of the notes at maturity on june  accordingly  the ability of the company and its subsidiary to repay the notes at maturity will be dependent upon its ability to refinance the notes 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to refinance the principal amount of the notes at maturity 
on or after june   the company may redeem notes from time to time at a premium beginning at and declining each subsequent year to par in as defined in the note indenture the note indenture provides that  in certain circumstances  the company and its subsidiary must offer to repurchase the notes upon the occurrence of a change of control or certain other events 
in the event of such mandatory redemption or repurchase prior to maturity  the company and its subsidiary would be unable to pay the principal amount of the notes without a refinancing 
the note indenture contains certain covenants  which limit the ability of the company and its restricted subsidiaries  subject to certain exceptions  to i incur additional indebtedness  ii pay dividends or other distributions  repurchase capital stock or other equity interests or subordinated indebtedness  iii enter into certain transactions with affiliates  iv create certain liens  v sell certain assets  and vi enter into certain mergers and consolidations 
as a result of these restrictions  the ability of the company and its subsidiaries to incur additional indebtedness to fund operations or to make capital expenditures is limited 
in the event that cash flow from operations is insufficient to cover cash requirements  the company and its subsidiaries would be required to curtail or defer certain of their capital expenditure programs  which could have an adverse effect on operations 
the company believes that it is in compliance with the covenants 
on july   the company entered into a million  five year senior secured credit facility 
the credit facility is secured by substantially the same collateral that secures the notes 
the lien on the collateral securing the credit facility is senior to the lien on the collateral securing the notes 
the credit facility contains customary conditions to borrowing and certain representations and warranties customary in gaming related finance 
the credit facility also contains financial covenants and restrictions regarding  among other things  indebtedness  distributions and changes in control 
under the credit facility  the company can obtain extensions of credit in the forms of cash and letters of credit 
the company is required to pay interest on all outstanding cash advances at the rate of interest announced by wells fargo at its principal office in san francisco as its prime rate plus or at the rate at which major international banks in london charge each other for borrowings in us dollars plus 
however  the minimum interest rate we will be charged on outstanding cash advances is 
the company is required to pay a fee on all outstanding letters of credit equal to their face value times an annual percentage rate of 
additionally  in the event of a default  the credit facility lender may increase the interest rate and letter of credit fee by an additional per year during the period of default 
at december   there were no amounts outstanding under the senior secured credit facility 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than years years more than year years long term debt     total     critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements requires the company s management to adopt accounting policies and to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and provision for income taxes 
management periodically evaluates its policies  estimates and assumptions related to these policies 
the company operates in a highly regulated industry 
for both our las vegas  nevada and black hawk  colorado operations we are subject to regulations that describe and regulate operating and internal control procedures 
the majority of our casino revenue is in the form of cash  personal checks or gaming chips and tokens  which by their nature do not require complex estimations 
we estimate certain liabilities with payment periods that extend for longer than several months 
such estimates include customer loyalty liabilities  self insured medical and workers compensation costs and litigation costs 
we believe that these estimates are reasonable based upon our past experience with the business and based upon our assumptions related to possible outcomes in the future 
however  future actual results will likely differ from these estimates 
the company has determined that the following accounting policies and related estimates are critical to the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements long lived assets the company has a significant investment in long lived property and equipment 
the company estimates that the nondiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of these assets exceed the current carrying value of these assets 
any adverse change to the estimate of these undiscounted future cash flows could necessitate an impairment charge that would adversely affect operating results 
the company estimates useful lives for its assets based on historical experience  estimates of assets commercial lives  and the likelihood of technological obsolescence 
should the actual useful life of a class of assets differ from the estimated useful life  the company would record an impairment charge 
the company reviews useful lives  obsolescence  and assesses commercial viability of these assets periodically 
we utilize estimates related to cash flow projections for the application of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
to the realization of deferred tax assets 
our estimates are based upon recent operating results and budgets for future operating results 
these estimates are made using assumptions about the economic  social and regulatory environments in which we operate 
these estimates could be negatively impacted by numerous unforeseen events including changes to regulations affecting how we operate our business  changes in the labor market or economic downturns in the areas where we operate 
provision for credit losses the company maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based on historical experience and specific customer collection issues 
any unforeseen change in customer liquidity or financial condition could adversely affect the collectibility of that account and the company s operating results
