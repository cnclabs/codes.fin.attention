overview novavax is a fully integrated specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the research  development and commercialization of products utilizing our proprietary drug delivery and vaccine technologies for large and growing markets  concentrating on the areas of women s health and infectious diseases 
our micellar nanoparticle technology involves the use of patented oil and water emulsions that we believe can be used as vehicles for the topical delivery of a wide variety of drugs and other therapeutic products  including hormones  and vaccine adjuvants  which are substances added to vaccines to enhance their effectiveness 
we believe that our technology represents the first time that ethanol soluble hormones  such as estrogen and testosterone  have been encapsulated and delivered 
in addition to estrasorb  our product candidates using these technologies include androsorb  a topical testosterone emulsion that has completed two phase i clinical trials  testestrasorb  a topical estrogen and testosterone emulsion  progestsorb ne  a topical progestin emulsion  and proestrasorb  a topical estrogen and progestin emulsion 
other drug delivery technologies  like our novasome and sterisome technologies  are being utilized to develop other products 
novasomes are used as adjuvants to enhance vaccine effectiveness 
sterisomes are being used for  among other things  subcutaneous injections that can deliver long acting drug effects 
we also conduct research and development on preventative vaccines and proteins  for infectious diseases  cancers and immunotherapies 
we are seeking fda approval of estrasorb for the reduction of hot flushes in menopausal women and  if approved  we believe estrasorb will be competitively positioned to address the estimated billion estrogen replacement therapy market in the united states 
in  novavax reported on its phase iii clinical trial results at two major medical conferences 
the study demonstrated that estrasorb treatment caused a statistically significant reduction in moderate and severe vasomotor symptoms hot flushes at weeks four  eight and twelve of the clinical trial 
in addition  a high percentage of women achieved cessation of moderate to severe hot flushes during the twelve week clinical trial 
a new drug application for estrasorb was submitted to the us food and drug administration in june and was accepted for review in august in april  we were informed by the fda that the agency had completed their review of the new drug application for estrasorb 
at that time  the agency did not raise any issues regarding the efficacy or safety of estrasorb  but did request additional information with respect to the chemistry  manufacturing and controls cmc section of the filing 
we determined that the most advantageous approach to resolving the outstanding cmc questions was to voluntarily withdraw the new drug application and resubmit it once all of the responses to the cmc questions have been prepared 
in september we resubmitted the new drug application  which was accepted for review by the fda in november in december  we acquired privately owned fielding pharmaceutical company  based in st 
louis  missouri  which sells  markets and distributes a proprietary line of pharmaceutical products focused on women s health 
under the terms of the acquisition agreement  we acquired of the outstanding shares of fielding for million 
the acquisition has been accounted for in the accompanying financial statements under the purchase method of accounting for business combinations 
in december we entered into a note purchase agreement with king pharmaceuticals  inc whereby we agreed to issue to king senior convertible promissory notes up to million 
on that same date  we issued a senior convertible promissory note with king for million in principal 
in september  we issued two additional senior convertible promissory notes for million each and in june we issued another senior convertible promissory note for million 
all of the notes  totaling million the notes  are due december  with interest payable in semi annual installments in cash  or in certain circumstances  up to in stock 
in january  we entered into a co promotion agreement with king for the company s topical estrogen replacement therapy  estrasorb  in the united states and puerto rico the territory 
we also entered into a license agreement with king for many countries outside the united states 
in june  we expanded and amended the agreements the amended agreements 
the amended agreements grant king exclusive rights to promote  market and distribute estrasorb in canada  and five additional countries in europe  and added androsorb  a topical testosterone replacement therapy for testosterone deficient women 
we feel this partnership has the potential to provide us with broader penetration into the women s health market for estrasorb and androsorb 
under the terms of the amended agreements  we received million from king in up front licensing fees  and we will also receive additional milestone payments of million upon estrasorb s approval in canada and million upon the first approval of estrasorb in any one of the five additional countries in europe 
we will also receive royalties on future sales outside the territory 
under the amended agreements  we also received a milestone payment from king of million for our submission of the estrasorb new drug application  in june  and an additional milestone payment of million for the acceptance for review of our new drug application by the fda in august in june  we further amended the co promotion agreement related to androsorb 
we will share equally in approved pre launch marketing costs for androsorb with king  while we will be solely responsible for the research and development expenses for androsorb 
in addition  king will pay us a million milestone payment upon the receipt of all approvals necessary for commercialization of androsorb 
we entered into two product agreements in and in january  we acquired avc cream and suppositories from king for million  which had previously been marketed by king for the treatment of vaginal bacterial infections 
in july   we entered into agreement with privately held ferndale laboratories  inc of ferndale  michigan 
under the agreement  we will co promote analpram hc  a prescription corticosteroid and anti pruritic product targeted at women suffering from hemorrhoids 
subsequent to year end  in february  we announced that we had completed a private placement of  common shares at per share to sj strategic investments llc  for total proceeds of million 
we believe this recent equity infusion will provide us with the necessary financial resources to launch estrasorb  if approved by the fda later this year  as well as to continue to pursue our other corporate activities 
critical accounting policies and changes to accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified below some of our more critical accounting policies and changes to accounting policies 
for further discussion of our accounting policies see footnote summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with the provisions of staff accounting bulletin no 
for our product sales  revenue is recognized when all of the following criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the seller s price to the buyer is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize these sales net of allowances for returns  rebates and chargebacks 
a large part of our product sales are to distributors who resell the products to their customers 
we provide rebates to members of certain buying groups who purchase from our distributors  to distributors that sell to their customers at prices determined under a contract between us and the customer or to state agencies  which administer various programs such as the federal medicaid and medicare programs 
rebate amounts are usually based upon the volume of purchases or by reference to a specific price for a product 
we estimate the amount of the rebate that will be paid  and record the liability as a reduction of revenue when we record our sale of the products 
settlement of the rebate generally occurs from three to months after sale 
we regularly analyze the historical rebate trends and make adjustments to recorded reserves for changes in trends and terms of rebate programs 
for up front payments and licensing fees related to our contract research or technology  we defer and recognize revenue as earned over the life of the related agreement 
milestone payments are recognized as revenue upon achievement of contract specified events and when there are no remaining performance obligations 
revenue earned under certain research contracts is recognized on the percentage of completion method 
the extent of progress toward contract completion is measured on the cost to cost method that also included an assessment of the remaining costs required to complete the contract or reach particular milestones 
revenues from contracts with acceptance terms are recognized when the customer has received and approved the services 
during the fourth quarter we reassessed the remaining costs  progress and milestones outstanding on four contracts 
based on this review we determined that estimated costs to complete had been underestimated throughout the year 
we have reevaluated the estimated costs to complete on all contracts 
the effect of this reevaluation is an  reduction to revenue   of which relates to two of the contracts  with no corresponding reduction in expenses 
the impact of this adjustment affects previously disclosed revenues in our quarterly reports 
we have shown the quarterly effects of these adjustments in item herein 
research and development costs research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we will continue to incur research and development costs as we expand our product development activities in our women s health and infectious disease programs 
our research and development costs have included  and will continue to include  expenses for internal development personnel  supplies and facilities  clinical trials  regulatory compliance and reviews  validation of processes and start up costs to establish commercial manufacturing capabilities 
at the time our product candidates are approved by the fda and we begin commercial manufacturing  we will no longer expense costs at our manufacturing location as research and development costs 
depreciation and amortization depreciation of furniture  fixtures and equipment is provided under the straight line method over the estimated useful lives  generally to years 
amortization of leasehold improvements is provided over the estimated useful lives of the improvements or the term of the lease  which ever is shorter 
in december we substantially completed the build out of our new manufacturing facility in philadelphia at a cost of approximately million 
in addition  we have purchased and installed approximately million of manufacturing equipment in preparation of anticipated fda approval of estrasrob in we do not plan to begin recognizing amortization or depreciation on these assets until manufacturing for commercialization begins 
at that time  the yearly amortization and depreciation expense will be from to million per year 
goodwill and intangibles assets goodwill and intangible assets principally result from business acquisitions  such as the million of goodwill we recognized for our acquisition of fielding in december assets acquired and liabilities assumed are recorded at their fair values  the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill 
intangible assets other than goodwill  are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  ranging from to years 
the company periodically evaluates the periods of amortization to determine whether later events and circumstances warrant revised estimates of useful lives 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  which is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under these rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests or more frequently should indicators of impairment arise 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful beginning in the first quarter of the company utilizes a discounted cash flow analysis  which includes profitability information  estimated future operating results  trends and other information in assessing whether the value of indefinite lived intangible assets can be recovered 
under sfas no 
 goodwill impairment is deemed to exist if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value 
in accordance with the requirements of sfas no 
 the company tested its goodwill for impairment as of january  and determined that no impairment was present 
in the fourth quarter of  the company performed the required annual impairment test on the carrying amount of its goodwill  which indicated the company s estimated fair value of goodwill exceeded it carrying value  therefore  no impairment was identified at december  future accounting for co promotion agreement under the terms of our co promotion agreement with king pharmaceuticals  inc we will be responsible for receiving orders  invoicing and distribution  thus  we will record all of the product sales  returns and allowances and cost of sales for estrasorb 
the resultant gross margin will be shared equally with king and the payment to king will be recorded as a selling and marketing expense on our statement of operations 
under the co promotion agreement  following product approval by the fda  both parties will also share equally in approved marketing expenses for the products 
all direct marketing expenses will be recorded by us  for which king will reimburse us fifty percent 
off balance sheet financing arrangement in  the company executed a conditional guaranty of a brokerage margin account for a director  in the amount of  results of operations for the years ended  and revenues revenues for the year ended were million compared to million in and million in this represents a decrease of million  or  from to  and an increase of million  or  from to the decrease from to relates to a decline in product sales from million in to million in  a decrease of million  a decline in contract research from million in to million in  a decrease of million  and a decline in milestone and license fee revenue from million in to million in  a decrease of million 
product sales were negatively impacted in primarily due to an approximately decline in sales for our prenatal vitamin line  as a result of increasing competitive pressure from generic alternatives  as well as declines in avc cream and gynodiol sales in due to effective sales promotions following the acquisition of these products in the reduction in contract research is primarily due to a year end reversal of  of revenue recognized in as previously described in summary of significant accounting policies revenue recognition 
the reduction in milestone and license fee revenues was due to the one time recognition of a million milestone received from king in for the timely filing of the nda for estrasorb 
the increase from to related primarily to million from products sales in related to our acquisitions of fielding and the avc product line  million for revenue recognized for milestone payments from king for the timely submission and subsequent acceptance of our estrasorb new drug application by the fda in  and  for license fees 
in addition to our new revenue sources  we recorded million from research and development contracts  primarily from the national institutes of health and other governmental agencies 
revenues for included  in license fees from king and million from research and development contracts  including million for contracts with the nih and other government agencies 
product sales contract research and development milestone and licensing fees total revenue net losses net loss for was million  or per share  compared to million  or per share for  and million  or per share in the increased loss of million from to related primarily to reduced product sales of million  a reduction in contract research revenues of million  a decrease in milestone revenues of million as previously described  increases in selling and marketing expenses of million in preparation of the anticipated approval and product launch of estrasorb and an increase of million in research and development expenses for manufacturing start up activities 
the improvement from to of million or 
per share related primarily to the gross margin on product sales due to our acquisitions of fielding and the avc product line and milestone revenue for payments from king  offset in by additional selling  general and administrative to support those product sales  the initiation of commercialization activities for estrasorb and additional research and development costs 
cost of sales cost of sales was million in compared to million in we had no product sales or cost of sales in the decrease in was primarily due to related decreases in product sales 
as a percentage of product sales  the cost of sales increased from in to in research and development expenses research and development expenses were million for  compared to million for and million in the increase from to of million  or  was primarily due to increases in manufacturing start up costs related to preparing our manufacturing facility for commercial production of estrasorb  offset by decreases in for clinical trial and nda preparation costs when compared to the manufacturing start up costs relate primarily to facility lease expenses  validation services  product stability testing and personnel costs 
the increase from to of million or was primarily due to costs associated with the preparation of the nda for estrasorb and also for internal development costs associated with our infectious diseases programs  offset by a decrease in clinical trial expenses 
prior to  we did not track all of our research and development total costs by project 
we have  however  tracked all of our external direct costs incurred for all projects  as well as our internal direct labor for our vaccine projects 
overhead and indirect costs have been allocated to our vaccine projects based on direct labor hours incurred and we will be expanding that policy to our other projects in in  we began tracking costs for each project 
reconciliation of significant research and development projects the following table reconciles the direct and indirect costs tracked and incurred to date for our major projects to our total research and development expense 
project estrasorb androsorb infectious disease vaccines allocated project costs other unallocated costs total estimated cost and time to complete major projects the amounts of the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources 
as of december   several of our proprietary product candidates were in various stages of development 
due to the inherent nature of our development  future market demand for products and factors outside of our control  such as clinical results and regulatory approvals  we are unable to estimate the completion dates and the estimated total costs for several of our products 
however  due to the late stage status of our estrasorb project we believe that the duration and estimated cost to complete is reasonably predictable 
we have included that information in the following table 
estimated development estimated project current status costs completion dates estrasorb nda filed million last year we estimated the cost to complete the estrasorb project to be from to million 
we based those projections on the anticipation that the estrasorb nda would be approved by mid as previously discussed  we did not receive approval at that time and we resubmitted the nda in september our additional costs in and our estimate for the completion of estrasorb in  above  include costs for manufacturing start up  regulatory issues  clinical studies  and re filing expenses due to the new timeline 
in addition to the project listed above we are currently developing other product candidates such as  androsorb  but do not believe that it is possible to estimate the completion date or cost to complete 
the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during clinical trial protocol  including  among others  the following number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  duration of the patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  number of clinical sites included in the trials  and length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
in addition  we test our potential products in numerous preclinical studies to identify among other things the daily dosage amounts 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results for our trials we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or indications 
we further believe that it is not possible to predict the length of regulatory approval time 
factors that are outside our control could significantly delay the approval and marketability of our product candidates 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to numerous variations 
our ability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
for more discussion of the risk and uncertainties and our liquidity  see risks and uncertainties and liquidity and capital resources 
selling and marketing expenses selling and marketing expenses were million for  compared to million in prior to our acquisition of fielding and the avc product line in december and january  respectively  and the anticipated approval of estrasorb  we had no sales or marketing expense 
in and  we incurred million and million  respectively  of selling expenses  and million and million  respectively  of marketing costs  to support our current product sales  as well as pre launch selling and marketing expenses for our anticipated launch of estrasorb 
selling and marketing costs both increased in with the anticipated commercialization of estrasorb 
when the launch was delayed  we took steps to reduce or defer previous levels of selling and marketing expenses 
we expect selling and marketing costs to increase substantially with the anticipated fda approval and commercialization of estrasorb 
in addition  all payments made to king in connection with the co promotion of estrasorb will be recorded as selling and marketing expenses in our statement of operations 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses were million in  compared to million in and million in the decrease from to of million is primarily due to the accounting change for goodwill amortization  as described above in goodwill and intangible assets  offset by increases in administrative and executive personnel over the past year to support our growth for the anticipated initiation of commercialization activities for estrasorb and increases in legal costs related to patent filings and research contract reviews 
the increase from to of million  or  was due to a number of factors  including approximately million of goodwill and intangible asset amortization related to our acquisitions of fielding and the avc product line  the increase in personnel from the fielding acquisition  and the full effect of increases in administrative and executive employees hired during to support our growth 
interest income expense net interest expense was million in  compared to  in and interest income of  in the increase in interest expense from to  of million  is due to the issuance of an additional million of notes to king and overall lower cash balances during the million increase in the interest expense in related to the issuance of million of the notes from king  offset by additional interest income from higher cash balances during compared to liquidity and capital resources our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including but not limited to the progress of our research and development programs  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the commercialization of our product candidates  the costs of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and changes in our development of commercialization activities and arrangements 
we plan to have multiple products in various stages of product development and we believe our research and development as well as selling  marketing and general administrative expenses and capital requirements will continue to increase 
future activities including clinical development  the establishment of commercial scale manufacturing capabilities and the development of sales and marketing programs are subject to our ability to raise funds through debt or equity financing  or collaborative arrangements with industry partners 
from through december  we have financed our operations primarily from the private placement of  shares of common stock in with net proceeds of approximately million  proceeds of approximately million from to from the notes with king for details on this transaction  refer to our discussion in the overview section above  proceeds of million from king in licensing fees and milestone payments for details on these transactions refer to our discussion in the overview section above  and and net proceeds of million from through for the exercise of stock options and warrants 
in addition  in february  we completed the private placement of  shares of common stock at per share net proceeds of million the february financing 
at december  we had cash and cash equivalents of million  compared to million at december  we invest our cash and cash equivalents in highly liquid  interest bearing  investment grade and government securities in order to preserve principal 
the million decrease in was due to our cash used in operations of million and our investments in capital equipment of million  offset by million of financing activities from the net issuance of million of convertible notes  the net exercise of million in options and warrants  and proceeds from equipment loans of million 
of the net million used in operations  we used approximately million to fund the activities of our research and development programs including costs associated with obtaining regulatory approval and clinical testing and manufacturing start up costs 
working capital was  at december  compared to million at december  the decrease in working capital was primarily due to the cash flow activities above 
our year end cash balance and working capital were substantially increased with the february financing 
due to the april withdrawal of our nda for estrasorb in order to provide additional information with respect to the cmc section of the filing  the previsoulsy anticipated launch date for estrasorb has been delayed pending the resubmission  which occurred in september  and subsequent anticipated approval by the food and drug administration 
the costs related to the re submission of the estrasorb nda were in the range of to million 
the delay in the launch date for estrasorb has had  and will continue to have  a negative effect on cash flow due to the related delays in revenues and some committed pre launch costs and capital expenditures that could not be eliminated or deferred 
we have been able to reduce or defer some  but not all  of the selling  marketing and manufacturing expenses and capital expenditure associated with estrasorb s product introduction 
we substantially completed the build out of our manufacturing facility in  but we have delayed the final delivery and acceptance of some manufacturing equipment until the first quarter of upon withdrawal of the estrasorb nda in april we prepared revised business plans for  and later in the year for  which assumed that we would obtain additional financing sufficient to fund our planned operations until the anticipated approval of estrasorb 
in june  we issued a million convertible note to king and subsequent to year end  in february  we completed the private placement of  shares of common stock for million 
in december and january  we also received a total of million of equipment financing from the philadelphia industrial development corporation 
in addition to these fundings  we may require additional funds in excess of our present working capital to complete the development of our product candidates and commercialization activities  including the final commercial scale up of our manufacturing facility 
we will continue to pursue raising capital through public or private equity or debt financing  collaborative arrangements with pharmaceutical companies and government agency contracts to defray the costs of clinical trials  product development  product line expansion and other related activities 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available at all or on acceptable terms to permit successful commercialization of our technologies and products 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we may be required to significantly delay  reduce the scope of or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs  downsize our selling  marketing  general and administrative infrastructure or programs  or seek alternative measures including arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates or products 
based on our assessment of our current business plans  in the absence of new financing  we believe we have adequate resources to meet our obligations for the next to months 
contractual obligations and commitments the following table summarizes our current obligations and commitments less than after commitments obligations total year years years years convertible notes operating leases financing leases manufacturing facility lease total commitments obligations item a
