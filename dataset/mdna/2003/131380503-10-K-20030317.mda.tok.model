finally  during the second quarter  the company commenced the generation of revenues from the credit card loyalty business segment 
while revenues were  management has placed significant emphasis on the development of this segment and currently believes that its revenues will comprise the material amount of consolidated revenues in future periods 
however  the successful generation of revenues from this segment is dependent upon many factors including the acceptance of the program by a high level of automotive dealers and the acquisition and maintenance of credit card processing services 
cost of revenues cost of revenues consists of project personnel and expenses associated with the technical staffing services and website design and implementation segments  and credit card loyalty program direct expenses

subsequently  the company received  in partial recovery of this loss 
there can be no assurances that any further recoveries will be received on this investment 
litigation settlements the company received an aggregate of  in settlements on certain matters under litigation in income taxes the income tax benefit of the company s operating losses was fully reserved during  compared to a partially recognized benefit of  in  due to the absence of sufficient positive evidence to justify carrying deferred tax assets

liquidity and capital resources general the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared on a going concern basis  which assumes that calton will realize its assets and discharge its liabilities in the normal course of business 
as reflected in the financial statements  calton has incurred losses from continuing operations of   and  and has used cash in continuing operations of   and  during the fiscal years ended november   and  respectively 
as of november   the company has working capital of  which is not sufficient to fund the current operating plan during the fiscal year ending on november  these conditions raise substantial doubt as to the ability of calton to continue its normal business operations as a going concern 
management s plans to sustain calton operations include accelerating and augmenting revenue opportunities  principally in the credit card loyalty segment  curtailing operating expenses to the extent appropriate and raise additional debt or equity capital from external sources 
as discussed above and in note to the accompanying financial statements  during  calton sold its non performing interest in innovation growth partners which contributed to the company s net loss in the amounts of   and  during the fiscal years ended november   and  respectively 
in addition  the internet development group of ecalton and privilegeone consolidated office space to best cross train and to leverage employee skill sets 
while management is actively addressing multiple sources of capital  there are currently no commitments  and there can be no assurances that sufficient capital can be raised under terms acceptable to management 
the financial statements do not include any adjustments that may arise as a result of this uncertainty 
cash flows from operating activities the company used  in operating activities  compared to  in operating activities 
the use of cash in each period was due to operating losses incurred in each period 
such losses are anticipated to continue until the company s credit card loyalty business segment commences the generation of significant revenues

the amount received of  was offset by purchases of treasury stock in the amount of  there are no further plans to purchase treasury stock in the open market 
as a result of the above cash flow activities  cash decreased from  at november  to  at november  total working capital deceased from  at november  to  at november  working capital available to the company as of november  is not currently sufficient to fund the company current operating plan 
as a result  management is engaged in reviewing alternative sources of capital and expense curtailment activities 
there can be no assurance that management will be successful in its efforts to curtail expenses or raise capital in amounts sufficient to sustain operations and achieve the company s plans 
commitments  guarantees and contingencies litigation claims the company continues to have responsibility for certain warranty and other claims in connection with the sale of calton homes and the purchase of privilegeone 
the agreement pursuant to which the company sold calton homes in december requires the company to indemnify the purchaser for  among other things  certain liabilities that arise out of events occurring prior to the closing  principally related to certain warranty claims on homes built 
as of november  and   and  respectively  were maintained in an escrow account for such contingencies 
however  the company s indemnification obligations are not limited to the amount in escrow 
as of november   the company has accrued  for known and estimable contingencies related to the sale of calton homes  the purchase of privilegeone and for matters that occur in the ordinary course of business

in addition to the general indemnification clause  in the event that the company elects to liquidate and dissolve prior to december   it will be required to organize a liquidating trust to secure its obligations to the calton homes purchaser 
the liquidating trust will be funded with the current escrowed amounts plus  at this time  management does not plan to liquidate or dissolve the company 
credit card processing agreement the company and privilegeone have entered into a credit card processing agreement with fleet pursuant to which fleet has agreed to issue and administer the privilegeone credit cards

privilegeone is required to pay fleet a fee for the development of the credit card for each participating automotive dealer

the credit card loyalty business segment is in an early stage of development 
having established technological and market feasibility  management is currently accessing marketing channels and developing strategic partners to support the business 
access to and maintenance of credit card services  such as those provided through the fleet agreement  is essential to conduct the credit card loyalty business segment 
failure to maintain such agreements would have a material adverse affect on the credit card loyalty business segment and  possibly the company 
operating lease commitments the company and its consolidated subsidiaries lease their facilities and certain equipment under operating lease agreements with various expiration dates through future non cancelable minimum lease payments for each of the following years ending november are as follows total  guarantees and off balance sheet arrangements the company has no guarantees outside of the consolidated organization and no off balance sheet arrangements of any nature 
particularly sensitive accounting estimates reserve for bad debts the company provides reserves against uncollectible accounts receivable 
this process requires significant subjective estimates that take into account the credit worthiness of the customer  historical collection experience  and the general economic environment 
during the current year  an in depth formal review was performed to review all open accounts receivable  write off balances known to be uncollectible against existing reserves  and estimate the appropriate levels of reserves on existing balances 
as a result of this process  reserves were reduced from  as of november  to  as of november  such reduction was effected by writing off  of deemed uncollectible accounts and a general reduction in the reserve of  other reserves the company continues to have responsibility for certain warranty and other claims in connection with the sale of calton homes and the purchase of privilegeone 
this accrual requires significant subjective estimates about existing and future claims  the ultimate outcome may be known only as a result of litigation or arbitration proceedings 
currently  management makes its estimates based upon the best available evidence  which includes its historical experience in the home building industry and the counsel of outside lawyers engaged in litigating certain other matters 
management applies the provisions of sfas accounting for contingencies in making its estimates  where amounts that are probable and estimable are recorded
