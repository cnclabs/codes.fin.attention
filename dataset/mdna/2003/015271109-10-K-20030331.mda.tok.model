item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the terms we  our  ours and us as used in this form k refer to alexandria real estate equities  inc and its subsidiaries 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this form k 
overview we are a publicly traded real estate operating company focused principally on the ownership  operation  management  acquisition  expansion and selective redevelopment and development of high quality  strategically located properties containing a combination of office and laboratory space leased principally to tenants in the life science industry 
we refer to these properties as life science facilities 
in  we acquired four properties with an aggregate of approximately  rentable square feet 
in addition  we completed the development of two properties with an aggregate of approximately  rentable square feet 
completed a public offering of  shares of our series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock  resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs 
sold  and  shares of common stock in two separate transactions  resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions and other offering costs 
expanded our unsecured line of credit from million to million and extended the term to july  which may be further extended at our sole option for an additional one year period 
our primary source of revenue is rental income and tenant recoveries from leases at the properties we own 
of the properties we owned as of december   four were acquired in  nine in  ten in  in  six in  in  five in and four in in addition  we completed the development of one property in  five properties in together with the properties acquired in  the properties  two properties in together with the five properties acquired in  the properties and two properties in together with the four properties acquired in  the properties 
as a result of these acquisition and development activities  there have been significant continuing increases in total revenues and expenses  including significant increases in total revenues and expenses for as compared to  and for as compared to critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
our significant accounting policies are described in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these estimates  judgments and assumptions on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
reit compliance we have elected to be taxed as a real estate investment trust reit under the internal revenue code the code 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex provisions of the code to our operations and financial results and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
we believe that our current organization and method of operation comply with the rules and regulations promulgated under the code to enable us to qualify  and continue to qualify  as a reit 
however  it is possible that we have been organized or have operated in a manner that would not allow us to qualify as a reit  or that our future operations could cause us to fail to qualify 
if we fail to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  then we will be required to pay federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
if we lose our reit status  then our net earnings available for investment or distribution to stockholders would be significantly reduced for each of the years involved and we would no longer be required to make distributions to our stockholders 
rental properties and properties under development rental properties and properties under development are stated at cost 
write downs to estimated fair value would be recognized when impairment indicators are present and a property s estimated undiscounted future cash flows  before interest charges  are less than its book value 
in that situation  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the fair value of the property 
capitalization of costs we capitalize direct construction and development costs  including predevelopment costs  interest  property taxes  insurance and indirect project costs  including payroll and other costs directly associated with the acquisition  development or construction of a project 
costs incurred after a project is substantially complete and ready for its intended use are expensed as incurred 
costs previously capitalized related to abandoned acquisition or development opportunities are written off 
should development activity decrease  a portion of interest  property taxes  insurance and certain costs would no longer be eligible for capitalization  and would be expensed as incurred 
we also capitalize leasing costs  including broker fees and certain costs related to our leasing personnel 
these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases 
costs previously capitalized related to unsuccessful leasing opportunities are written off 
valuation of investments we hold equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities primarily involved in the life science industry 
if a decline in the fair value of an investment below its carrying value is determined to be other than temporary  such investment is written down to its estimated fair value with a non cash charge to current earnings 
the factors that we consider in our valuation assessments include  but are not limited to  market prices  market conditions  prospects for favorable or unfavorable clinical trial results  new product initiatives and new collaborative agreements 
interest rate swap agreements we utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit 
these agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount the notional amount 
interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one month libor rate 
the net difference between the interest paid and the interest received is reflected as an adjustment to interest expense 
we reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values 
we use a variety of methods and assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements 
these methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never be realized 
all of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed effective under statement of financial accountings standards no 
in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates 
accordingly  we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges did not qualify as highly effective  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
we do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established  well capitalized financial institutions 
revenue recognition rental income from leases with scheduled rent increases  free rent and other rent adjustments are recognized on a straight line basis over the respective lease terms 
we maintain an allowance for estimated losses that may result from the inability of our tenants to make required payments 
if a tenant fails to make contractual payments beyond any allowance  we may recognize additional bad debt expense in future periods equal to the amount of unpaid rent and deferred rent 
discontinued operations the determination of whether a property qualifies as an asset held for sale and should be classified as discontinued operations requires an evaluation of certain criteria  some of which require the use of judgment 
a property is classified as held for sale when all of the following criteria for a plan of sale have been met management  having the authority to approve the action  commits to a plan to sell the property  the property is available for immediate sale in its present condition  subject only to the terms that are usual and customary  an active program to locate a buyer  and other actions required to complete the plan to sell  have been initiated  the sale of the property is probable and is expected to be completed within one year  the property is being actively marketed for sale at a price that is reasonable in relation to its current fair value and actions necessary to complete the plan indicate that it is unlikely that significant changes to the plan will be made or that the plan will be withdrawn 
when all of these criteria have been met  the property is classified as held for sale and its operations are classified as discontinued operations 
amounts from prior periods are reclassified from continuing operations to discontinued operations 
a loss is recognized for any initial adjustment of the asset s carrying amount to fair value less costs to sell in the period the asset qualifies as held for sale 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december rental revenue increased by million  or  to million for compared to million for the increase resulted primarily from the properties being owned for a full year and the addition of the properties

from january  to december   we expanded our scope of operations to include an additional properties containing approximately  rentable square feet for a total of properties located in nine states with approximately million rentable square feet 
to assist in managing this increase in the size of our operating portfolio  we have added personnel and offices in certain of the markets where we have properties

the maximum permitted amount of borrowings under the amended line of credit is million 
the amended line of credit has a maturity date of july  which may be extended at our sole option for an additional one year period 
borrowings under our unsecured line of credit  as amended  bear interest at a floating rate based on our election of either a libor based rate or the higher of the bank s reference rate and the federal funds rate plus 
for each libor based advance  we must elect a libor period of one  two  three or six months 
our line of credit contains financial covenants  including  among other things  maintenance of minimum net worth  a total liabilities to gross asset value ratio  and a fixed charge coverage ratio 
in addition  the terms of the line of credit restrict  among other things  certain investments  indebtedness  distributions and mergers

aggregate borrowings under the line of credit may be limited to an amount based on the net operating income derived from a pool of unencumbered properties

we utilize interest rate swap agreements to hedge a portion of our exposure to variable interest rates associated with our unsecured line of credit 
these agreements involve an exchange of fixed and floating interest payments without the exchange of the underlying principal amount the notional amount 
interest received under all of our swap agreements is based on the one month libor rate

sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended by statement no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities 
sfas  as amended  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative financial instruments such as our interest rate swap agreements 
specifically  sfas requires us to reflect our interest rate swap agreements on the balance sheet at their estimated fair values 
we use a variety of methods and assumptions based on market conditions and risks existing at each balance sheet date to determine the fair values of our interest rate swap agreements 
these methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value  and such value may never be realized 
as of january   the adoption of sfas  as amended  resulted in qualifying interest rate swap agreements reported on the balance sheet as a liability of approximately million  with a corresponding reduction to accumulated other comprehensive income  a separate component of stockholders equity 
all of our interest rate swap agreements meet the criteria to be deemed effective under sfas in reducing our exposure to variable interest rates 
accordingly  we have categorized these instruments as cash flow hedges 
while we intend to continue to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  if hedges did not qualify as highly effective  the changes in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in earnings 
we do not believe we are exposed to more than a nominal amount of credit risk in our interest rate swap agreements as our counterparties are established  well capitalized financial institutions 
in addition  we have entered into master derivative agreements with each counterparty 
these master derivative agreements all of which are on the standard international swaps derivatives association  inc isda form define certain terms between us and each counterparty to address and minimize certain risks associated with our swap agreements  including a default by a counterparty 
on january   we terminated an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million  an interest pay rate of and a maturity of december  the terminated interest rate swap agreement was replaced with the interest rate swap agreement as shown in the table above 
the fair value of the terminated interest rate swap agreement at the date of termination a liability of  was transferred to the replacement interest rate swap agreement 
during  approximately  was reclassified from other comprehensive income to interest expense 
approximately  was credited against interest expense during these adjustments resulted in an effective interest pay rate for the interest rate swap agreement of for and for as of december  and  our interest rate swap agreements have been reported in the accompanying balance sheets at their fair value as other liabilities of approximately million and million  respectively 
the offsetting adjustments were reflected as deferred losses in accumulated other comprehensive income of million and million  respectively 
balances in accumulated other comprehensive income are recognized in earnings as swap payments are made 
other resources and liquidity requirements in january  we completed a public offering of  shares of our series b cumulative redeemable preferred stock 
the shares were issued at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of offering costs 
in february  we sold  shares of our common stock 
the shares were issued at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of offering costs 
in july  we sold  shares of our common stock 
the shares were issued at a price of per share  resulting in aggregate proceeds of approximately million  net of offering costs 
we expect to continue meeting our short term liquidity and capital requirements generally through our working capital and net cash provided by operating activities 
we believe that the net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make distributions necessary to continue qualifying as a reit 
we also believe that net cash provided by operating activities will be sufficient to fund our recurring non revenue enhancing capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing commissions 
we expect to meet certain long term liquidity requirements  such as property acquisitions  property development and redevelopment activities  scheduled debt maturities  expansions and other non recurring capital improvements  through excess net cash provided by operating activities  long term secured and unsecured borrowings  including borrowings under the line of credit and the issuance of additional debt and or equity securities 
exposure to environmental liabilities in connection with the acquisition of all of our properties  we have obtained phase i environmental assessments to ascertain the existence of any environmental liabilities or other issues 
the phase i environmental assessments of our properties have not revealed any environmental liabilities that we believe would have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations taken as a whole  nor are we aware of any material environmental liabilities that have occurred since the phase i environmental assessments were completed 
in addition  we carry a policy of pollution legal liability insurance covering exposure to certain environmental losses at all of our properties 
capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing costs the following table shows total and weighted average per square foot property related capital expenditures  tenant improvements and leasing costs all of which are added to the basis of the properties related to our life science facilities excluding capital expenditures and tenant improvements that are recoverable from tenants  revenue enhancing or related to properties that have undergone redevelopment for the years ended december     and  attributable to leases that commenced at our properties after our acquisition 
total weighted average capital expenditures major capital expenditures    recurring capital expenditures    weighted average square feet in portfolio     per weighted average square foot in portfolio major capital expenditures recurring capital expenditures tenant improvements and leasing costs retenanted space tenant improvements and leasing costs    retenanted square feet    per square foot leased of retenanted space renewal space tenant improvements and leasing costs    renewal square feet    per square foot leased of renewal space major capital expenditures consist of roof replacements and hvac systems which are typically identified and considered at the time a property is acquired 
recurring capital expenditures for includes  per square foot in portfolio related to a fully leased property in san diego  california that underwent substantial renovation in excludes space that has undergone redevelopment before retenanting 
capital expenditures fluctuate in any given period due to the nature  extent and timing of improvements required and the extent to which they are recoverable from our tenants 
approximately of our leases provide for the recapture of certain capital expenditures such as hvac systems maintenance and or replacement  roof replacement and parking lot resurfacing 
in addition  we maintain an active preventative maintenance program at each of our properties to minimize capital expenditures required 
tenant improvements and leasing costs also fluctuate in any given year depending upon factors such as the timing and extent of vacancies  property age  location and characteristics  the type of lease renewal tenant or retenanted space  the involvement of external leasing agents and overall competitive market conditions 
inflation as of december   approximately of our leases on a square footage basis were triple net leases  requiring tenants to pay substantially all real estate taxes and insurance  common area and other operating expenses including increases thereto 
in addition  approximately of our leases on a square footage basis required the tenants to pay a majority of operating expenses 
approximately of our leases on a square footage basis contain effective annual rent escalations that are either fixed generally ranging from to or indexed based on the consumer price index or another index 
accordingly  we do not believe that our earnings or cash flow from real estate operations are subject to any significant risk of inflation 
an increase in inflation  however  could result in an increase in the cost of our variable rate borrowings  including our unsecured line of credit 
funds from operations we believe that funds from operations ffo is helpful to investors as an additional measure of the performance of an equity reit 
we compute ffo in accordance with standards established by the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit in its april white paper the white paper  which may differ from the methodology for calculating ffo utilized by other equity reits  and  accordingly  may not be comparable to such other reits 
the white paper defines ffo as net income loss computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains or losses from assets  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
while ffo is a relevant and widely used measure of operating performance of reits  it should not be considered as an alternative to net income determined in accordance with gaap as an indication of our financial performance  or to cash flows from operating activities determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of our liquidity  nor is it indicative of funds available to fund our cash needs  including our ability to make distributions 
see cash flows for information regarding these measures of cash flow 
the following table presents our ffo for the years ended december   and in thousands year ended december  income before extraordinary item    less dividends on preferred stock    add depreciation and amortization    non cash impairment charges  funds from operations    non cash impairment charges consist of a  impairment charge related to an asset held for sale in the san francisco bay market which could not be redeveloped pursuant to its original strategic objectives and a  impairment charge on investments

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the exposure to loss resulting from changes in interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the primary market risk to which we are exposed is interest rate risk  which may result from many factors  including governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economic and political considerations and other factors that are beyond our control 
in order to modify and manage the interest rate characteristics of our outstanding debt and to limit the effects of interest rate risks on our operations  we may utilize a variety of financial instruments  including interest rate swaps  caps  floors and other interest rate exchange contracts 
the use of these types of instruments to hedge our exposure to changes in interest rates carries additional risks  such as counter party credit risk and the legal enforceability of hedging contracts 
our future earnings  cash flows and fair values relating to financial instruments are primarily dependent upon prevalent market rates of interest  such as libor 
however  our interest rate swap agreements are intended to reduce the effects of interest rate changes 
based on interest rates at  and our swap agreements in effect on  december   we estimate that a increase in interest rates on our line of credit  after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements  would decrease annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
we further estimate that a decrease in interest rates on our line of credit  after considering the effect of our interest rate swap agreements in effect december   would increase annual future earnings and cash flows by approximately million 
a increase in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would decrease their aggregate fair value by approximately million 
a decrease in interest rates on our secured debt and interest rate swap agreements would increase their aggregate fair value by approximately million 
these amounts are determined by considering the impact of the hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost and our interest rate swap agreements in effect on december  these analyses do not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
further  in the event of a change of such magnitude  we would consider taking actions to further mitigate our exposure to the change 
however  due to the uncertainty of the specific actions that would be taken and their possible effects  the sensitivity analysis assumes no changes in our capital structure 
we have exposure to equity price market risk because of our equity investments in certain publicly traded companies and privately held entities 
we classify investments in publicly traded companies as available for sale and  consequently  record them on our balance sheet at fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a component of comprehensive income or loss 
investments in privately held entities are generally accounted for under the cost method  as we do not influence any of the investees operating or financial policies 
for all investments  we recognize other than temporary declines in value against earnings in the same period the decline in value was deemed to have occurred 
in  we recorded non cash impairment charges of  to write down certain investments for which we deemed the decline in fair value to be other than temporary 
there is no assurance that future declines in values will not have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations 
by way of example  a decrease in the fair value of our equity investments would decrease their fair value by approximately million
