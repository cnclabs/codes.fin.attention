introduction we were formed in june to succeed to the business operations of companies previously acquired by bwi  as described below 
from our formation through our initial public offering  or ipo  on october   we operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of bwi  and procured a number of services from  and engaged in a number of financial and other transactions with  bwi 
after the ipo  we continued to be controlled by bwi  but operated on a stand alone basis 
on december   bwi distributed to the holders of bwi common stock on december  all of the shares of our class a common stock owned by bwi  making priority healthcare corporation a stand alone public company 
the financial information included in this annual report on form k prior to is not necessarily indicative of our future results of operations  financial position and cash flows as a stand alone public company 
priority is a national specialty pharmacy and distributor that provides biopharmaceuticals  complex therapies and related disease treatment programs and services to individuals with chronic diseases 
we sell over  skus of specialty pharmaceuticals and medical supplies to outpatient renal care centers and office based physicians in oncology and other physician specialty markets 
priority offers value added services to meet the specific needs of these markets by shipping refrigerated pharmaceuticals overnight in special packaging to maintain appropriate temperatures  offering automated order entry services and offering customized distribution for group accounts

we also provide disease treatment programs for hepatitis  cancer  infertility  hemophilia  human growth hormone deficiency  rheumatoid arthritis  crohn s disease  respiratory syncytial virus rsv  infertility  pulmonary hypertension  pain management  multiple sclerosis and others 
critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
for a summary of all of our accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note of the financial statements 
the items in our financial statements requiring significant estimates and judgments are as follows revenue recognition revenues are recognized when products are shipped to unaffiliated customers with appropriate provisions recorded for estimated discounts and contractual allowances 
discounts and contractual allowances are estimated based on historical collections from all unaffiliated customers 
any differences between our estimates and actual collections are reflected in operations in the year payment is received 
differences may result in the amount and timing of our revenue for any period if actual performance varies from our estimates 
receivables receivables are presented net of the allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances 
receivables include trade and patient account receivables and the current portion of trade receivables that have been converted to note receivables 
we regularly review and analyze the adequacy of these allowances after considering the age of each outstanding receivable and the collection history 
the allowance for doubtful accounts and contractual allowances are based on these analyses 
intangibles effective on december   we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which superseded apb opinion no 
 intangible assets 
this statement addresses the accounting and reporting of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
in accordance with the adoption of sfas no 
 we ceased amortization of goodwill effective december  we believe the accounting estimate related to the valuation of our goodwill and other intangible assets is a critical accounting estimate because significant changes in assumptions could materially affect key financial measures  including net earnings and other non current assets  specifically goodwill 
the valuation of goodwill involves a high degree of judgment since the first step of the impairment test required by sfas no 
consists of a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit with its book value 
based on the assumptions underlying the valuation  impairment is determined by estimating the fair value of a reporting unit and comparing that value to the reporting unit s book value 
if the fair value is more than the book value of the reporting unit  an impairment loss is not recognized 
if an impairment exists  the fair value of the reporting unit is allocated to all of its assets and liabilities excluding goodwill  with the excess amount representing the fair value of goodwill 
an impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the book value of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of that goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be allocated to reporting units 
we have one reporting unit and the fair value of the reporting unit exceeded its carrying amount 
in december  we performed the annual impairment test required by sfas no 
and determined that goodwill was not impaired as of december  we utilize a valuation technique based on the readily available stock market valuation of priority healthcare corporation 
changes in the valuation could result in impairment being recorded 
income taxes as a matter of course  we are subject to audit by federal and state tax authorities 
these audits could result in proposed assessments that challenge certain tax positions which  if upheld through the administrative and legal process  could have a material impact on our earnings and cash flow 
we believe that our tax positions comply with applicable tax law and we do not anticipate any material earnings or cash flow impact 
results of operations compared to net sales 
net sales increased to billion in from million in  an increase of 
the growth primarily reflected the addition of new customers  new product introductions  additional sales to existing customers  the acquisitions of freedom drug effective january   physicians formulary effective april   infurx effective october  and hoss effective march  and inflationary price increases 
the additional net sales attributed to the acquisitions of freedom drug  physicians formulary  infurx and hoss in prior to january  for freedom drug  prior to april  for physicians formulary and prior to october  for infurx represented approximately of the total net sales in gross profit

the decrease in sga expense as a percentage of net sales resulted from larger bad debt charges being incurred in and from spreading fixed costs over a larger sales base in management continually monitors sga expense and remains focused on controlling these increases through improved technology and efficient asset management

the increase in gross profit reflected increased sales and the acquisitions of freedom drug  physicians formulary and infurx 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased in to from in this decrease was primarily attributed to changing payor reimbursement patterns  as the use of prescription benefit management pbm plans increased and reimbursement from major medical plans for certain prescribed drugs decreased  and the change in sales mix  as lower margin products experienced increased sales

the decrease was primarily due to the eleven short term interest rate cuts during in and the interest income was primarily related to amounts earned by investing cash and funds received from operations  the secondary public offering of our class b common stock and stock option exercises in overnight repurchase agreements with major financial institutions and in marketable securities 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes in and represented and  respectively  of earnings before income taxes 
during  our state income taxes increased because of the acquisitions we made during the year and our presence in additional states 
liquidity and capital resources our principal capital requirements have been to fund working capital needs to support internal growth  for acquisitions and for capital expenditures 
our principal working capital needs are for inventory and accounts receivable 
management controls inventory levels in order to minimize carrying costs and maximize purchasing opportunities 
we sell inventory to our customers on various payment terms 
this requires significant working capital to finance inventory purchases and entails accounts receivable exposure in the event any of our major customers encounter financial difficulties 
although we monitor closely the creditworthiness of our major customers  there can be no assurance that we will not incur some collection loss on major customer accounts receivable in the future 
we had cash and cash equivalents of million  marketable securities of million and working capital of million at december  we believe that the cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  working capital and cash from operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs for at least two years 
net cash provided by operating activities 
our operations generated million in cash during receivables  net of acquisitions  increased million  primarily to support the increase in sales and the extension of credit terms to meet competitive conditions 
finished goods inventory  net of acquisitions  increased million  primarily due to new product introductions  to support the increase in sales and to take advantage of some purchasing opportunities 
the million increase in accounts payable  net of acquisitions  partially reduced the cash requirements for receivables and finished goods inventory  this increase was attributable to the increase in finished goods inventory  the timing of payments and the credit terms negotiated with vendors 
other current assets and liabilities  net of acquisitions  generated million of cash  primarily due to the increase in income taxes payable and expense accruals that will be paid in we anticipate that our operations may require the use of currently available cash and marketable securities to fund our growth 
during  d a totaled million  provision for doubtful accounts totaled million and impairment of fixed asset totaled million 
we also generated  from the tax benefit related to stock option exercises during net cash used by investing activities 
in  we sold million of marketable securities primarily to finance the acquisition of hoss  make an earn out payment related to the freedom drug acquisition  make a holdback payment related to the infurx acquisition  purchase treasury stock  invest in and make long term advances to our joint venture and purchase fixed assets 
capital expenditures during totaled million 
primarily these purchases were for computer hardware and software  furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
we expect that capital expenditures during will be approximately to million 
we anticipate that these expenditures will relate primarily to the purchase of computer hardware and software  telecommunications equipment  furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
in  other current assets and other assets increased million primarily due to investing in and making long term advances to our joint venture and making an additional deposit with a major supplier 
effective march   we acquired the majority of the operating assets of hoss  the leading provider of hemophilia products and services in the state of florida 
during  we paid million towards the acquisition of hoss and million related to the acquisitions of freedom drug and infurx 
net cash used by financing activities 
during  we received proceeds of million from stock option exercises and we purchased treasury stock for million 
we purchased the treasury stock because we thought it was an attractive investment 
we are authorized to purchase another  shares of treasury stock until july inflation our financial statements are prepared on the basis of historical costs and are not intended to reflect changes in the relative purchasing power of the dollar 
because of our ability to take advantage of forward purchasing opportunities  we believe that our gross profits generally increase as a result of manufacturers price increases in the products we distribute 
gross profits may decline if the rate of price increases by manufacturers declines 
generally  price increases are passed through to customers as we receive them and therefore they reduce the negative effect of inflation 
other non inventory cost increases  such as payroll  supplies and services  have been partially offset during the past three years by increased volume and productivity 
new accounting pronouncements in july  sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets were issued 
sfas no 
requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
recorded goodwill and intangibles were evaluated against this new criteria during the year ended december  sfas no 
requires the use of a nonamortization approach to account for purchased goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
during the year ended december   goodwill and certain intangibles were not amortized into results of operations  but instead were reviewed for impairment and will be written down and charged to results of operations only in the periods in which the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles is more than its fair value 
the provisions of each statement which apply to goodwill and intangible assets acquired prior to june  were adopted on december  the adoption of these accounting standards had the impact of reducing our amortization of goodwill and intangibles expense by approximately million during the year ended december  impairment reviews may result in future periodic write downs 
in october  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets was issued 
we adopted this statement effective in sfas no 
establishes a single accounting model for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure was issued 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
this statement also amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
finally  this statement amends accounting principles board opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
as required  we adopted this statement effective in the adoption did not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary exposure to market risk consists of a decline in the market value of our investments in marketable debt securities as a result of potential changes in interest rates 
market risk was estimated as the potential decrease in fair value resulting from a hypothetical increase in interest rates on securities included in our portfolio  and given the short term maturities of all of our investments in interest sensitive securities  this hypothetical fair value was not materially different from the period end carrying value
