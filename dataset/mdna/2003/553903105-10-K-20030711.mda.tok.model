financial restructuring during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million which consisted of million  million and million charges related to the abandonment of either underutilized or historically unprofitable facilities  a headcount reduction of employees  and the disposal of certain fixed assets  respectively 
the cash outflow of the restructuring charge was million  related to severance  of which million was paid in fiscal year the remaining million was paid in the first quarter of fiscal year during the first quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a restructuring charge of million which consisted of charges of million related to headcount reduction of employees  or of the company s workforce  and million related to the disposal or abandonment of fixed assets 
of the employees terminated       and were from the sales  marketing  general and administrative  customer service  research and development  and manufacturing departments  respectively 
the cash outflow of the restructuring charge was million related to severance  which was paid during fiscal year in the third quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million restructuring charge due to lower than anticipated lease payments from sub lessees in our sunnyvale  california and raleigh  north carolina facilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million restructuring charge due to lower than anticipated lease payments from sub lessees in our european facilities 
we face significant risks and uncertainties in connection with these restructuring activities and we have incurred substantial charges in connection with the restructuring 
despite the restructuring activities that have taken place to date  we continue to incur recurring losses from operations 
there can be no assurance that the restructuring will be successful or that the anticipated cost savings will be realized 
please see factors that may affect future results for additional risks related to the restructuring 

table of contents critical accounting policies this section of this report entitled management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and disclosures of assets and liabilities and revenues and expenses as of the date of our financial statements 
we based our estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that are most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations  and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgements  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and could potentially produce materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
for a detailed discussion of the application of the following critical accounting policies and other accounting policies  see notes to the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
we record sales of our equipment after the inventories have cleared customs  if necessary  and upon pick up by a common carrier for fob origin shipments 
for fob destination shipments  sales are recorded upon delivery to the customer 
sales are recorded net of an allowance for estimated returns  as long as no significant post delivery obligations exist and collection of the resulting receivable is probable and the sales price is fixed or determinable 
generally  product sales are not contingent upon customer testing  approval and or acceptance 
however  if sales require customer acceptance or include post delivery obligations  revenue is recognized upon customer acceptance or fulfillment of any post delivery obligations 
we record revenue from equipment maintenance contracts as deferred income when billed and we recognize this revenue as earned over the period in which the services are provided  primarily straight line over the term of the contract 
we accrue for warranty expense at the time revenue is recognized and maintain a warranty accrual for the estimated future warranty obligation based upon the relationship between historical and anticipated costs and sales volumes 
we apply statement of position sop  software revenue recognition as amended by sop  modification of sop with respect to certain transactions  whereby revenue is recognized from software licenses  provided the software has been delivered to the customer  persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price charged to the customer is fixed or determinable and there are no significant obligations on our part related to the sale and the resulting receivable is deemed collectible  net of an allowance for returns  cancellations and maintenance  including vendor and post contract support obligations 
we recognize revenue from maintenance agreements ratably over the term of the related agreement 
revenue from consulting and other software related services is recognized as the services are rendered 
we consider sales contracts that include a combination of systems  software or services to be multiple element arrangements 
an item is considered a separate element if it involves a separate earnings process 
if an arrangement includes undelivered elements that are not essential to the functionality of the delivered elements  the company defers the fair value of the undelivered elements with the residual revenue allocated to the delivered elements 
discounts are allocated only to the delivered elements 
fair value is determined based upon the price charged when the element is sold separately 
undelivered elements typically include installation  training  warranty  maintenance and professional services 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make payments for products sold or services rendered 
we analyze accounts receivable  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers deteriorates  resulting in an inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 

table of contents income taxes 
we are required to estimate our income taxes which includes estimating our current income taxes as well as measuring the temporary differences resulting from different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets or liabilities 
we apply statement of financial accounting standards no 
statement  accounting for income taxes  under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of existing assets and liabilities and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse  net of a valuation allowance 
we have recorded a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets as management has determined that it is more likely than not that these assets will not be utilized 
in the event that actual results differ from our estimates  our provision for income taxes could be materially impacted 
valuation of goodwill 
we assess the impairment of goodwill in accordance with statement on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
upon the adoption of statement and the completion of the transitional impairment test in fiscal year  we concluded that there was no impairment of goodwill 
the company completed its annual assessment for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal year and no impairment was found to exist 
changes in assumptions and estimates included within this analysis could produce significantly different results than those identified above and those recorded in the consolidated financial statements 
inventories 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or market  net of an allowance for obsolete  slow moving  and unsalable inventory 
the allowance is based upon management s review of inventories on hand  historical product sales  and future sales forecasts 
historically  we used rolling forecasts based upon anticipated product orders to determine our component and product inventory requirements 
as a reseller  we intend to procure inventory primarily upon receipt of purchase orders from customers 
lead times for products  materials and components that we order may vary significantly and depend upon factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand 
as a result  our product and component requirement forecasts may not be accurate 
if we overestimate our product or component requirements  we may have excess inventory  which could lead to additional excess and obsolete charges 
results of operations the following table sets forth selected items from the consolidated statements of operations as a percentage of total revenue for the periods indicated  except for product gross profit and service gross profit  
table of contents which are expressed as a percentage of the related revenue 
this information should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein fiscal year ended april  april  april  net product revenue service revenue total revenue product gross profit service gross profit gross profit selling  general and administrative research and development restructuring charges operating loss other income  net equity in net loss and write down of net investment of affiliate gain loss on foreign currency transactions income tax expense net loss net product revenue 
net product revenue for fiscal year decreased million  or from fiscal year this decrease was primarily because of a million and a million  or and  decrease in domestic product and international product revenue  respectively 
in terms of product mix on a worldwide basis  this decrease was the result of decreased revenue of million  million and million from server products  tape libraries and tape related software products  respectively 
server products revenue in fiscal year from the vivant product family was million  down from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales volume rather than average sales price 
in general  we have found that our customer base has become much more cautious in its buying patterns and purchasing is being confined to an as needed basis  with increasing levels of customer justification and management approval required during the sales process 
this more difficult sales environment is partially a result  but not solely a result  of the ongoing global economic downturn  coupled with the us war against iraq 
as a result  our customers have delayed or reduced their expenditures  including those for information technology  thus decreasing the current demand for our information storage systems and software 
we also believe that our customers have been cautious to purchase our proprietary products due to our prior financial weaknesses and lack of sources of working capital 
we believe that the comerica line of credit of million coupled with the emc reseller agreement will enhance our future ability to increase product revenues 
additionally  aggressive competition in the form of pricing discounts offered by emc  hitachi data systems  hewlett packard company  sun microsystems  inc  ibm  and network appliance  inc  each of which has substantially greater name recognition  marketing capabilities and financial and personnel resources than we have  have contributed to the decrease in our sales 
as a result and in an effort to increase revenue  we have done the following we have transitioned away from manufacturing to emphasize and further develop our capabilities as a storage solutions provider 
in an effort to de emphasize our proprietary products in favor of mti integrated solutions using third party name brand products  including third party storage subsystems  we entered into a reseller agreement with emc on march   in which we have the right to resell the complete line of emc automated networked storage systems and software 
we realize that in order to continue to provide the broadest array of storage solutions we require access to a full complement of technology from the leaders in the industry 
we believe that emc provides the most 
table of contents comprehensive compilation of storage solutions in the market today 
through this relationship  we have gained access to a broad array of disk based solutions  from the high end symmetrix through the clariion networked storage systems and platform based software  celerra tm network servers  centera tm cas content addressed storage systems and the connectrix tm family of directors and switches 
with our current product partnership relationships  we can offer our customers effective solutions addressing the majority of their business and regulatory requirements 
historically  we sold our solutions and services to the global companies for their data center computing environments 
we will be expanding our customer base to include the mid range enterprise market 
we have enhanced our customer satisfaction and account retention team of technology specialists to ensure that we keep in constant communication with our customers  regardless of their size 
in an attempt to offset some of the pricing discounts being offered by our competitors  in october we partnered with canopy capital to provide creative and flexible financing options to our customers to increase revenues 
as the program is relatively new  we have not had any success in generating sales through this channel and intend to expand the program further 
to date the financing program is only being offered to our us customer base but we hope to offer it to our european customer base as well 
as of april   there was no sales activity involving canopy capital 
as a part of the emc reseller agreement  we have the ability to introduce our customers and potential customers to emc s global financial services which will enhance and supplement the canopy capital flexible financing options 
sales through this group had not commenced as of the end of the fiscal year and  therefore  the magnitude of such services remains relatively uncertain 
net product revenue for fiscal year decreased million  or from fiscal year this decrease was the result of decreased revenue of million  million and million from server products  tape libraries and software products  respectively 
server products revenue in fiscal year from the vivant product family was million  down from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales volume  mainly from the decrease in sales of our proprietary products resulting from the global economic slowdown and our inability to penetrate global customers 
our business is greatly affected by general economic and business conditions 
continued softness in the information technology market in both the us and in europe and consumers uncertainty about the global economic condition resulted in further reduced demand for our products and services 
as a result of the weakened global economy  consumers were postponing or reducing expenditures  causing our revenue  our operating results and our financial condition to decline 
the downturn also had led to restructuring actions such as  but not limited to  the relocation of manufacturing activities  complete or partial abandonment of underutilized facilities  headcount reduction  fixed asset write offs and inventory write offs 
as a result  we were shifting to integrated third party products 
service revenue 
service revenue was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year this decrease was attributable to decreased maintenance revenue of million  decreased consulting revenue of million and other decreased service revenue of million 
the decrease in maintenance revenue is primarily due to the expiration of maintenance contracts without offsetting renewed and new maintenance contracts 
we attribute the lower number of renewals to the loss of customers to our competitors  customers that have updated their technology which is now covered by warranty  and customers that have ceased operations 
the decrease in consulting and other revenue is primarily attributable to decreased product revenue 
we recently changed our service and business systems operations throughout the world to operate under one leadership in an attempt to minimize duplication of costs  increase efficiencies and exploit successful operations 
even though service revenue has been declining  it remains our foundation and provides significant contribution to our gross profit 
subsequent to the end of fiscal year  we became a reseller and service provider of emc automated networked storage systems and software 
commencing with the resell of the emc array of products  most emc hardware products will have up to year xx warranty 
as a result  the amount of post warranty service contracts associated with those hardware product sales is expected to decrease in value 
thus  depending upon the conversion of our current customer base to 
table of contents emc products from mti proprietary products  service revenues may decrease 
however  as sales of emc products increase  we expect that sales of back up products  which are not a part of the emc reseller s agreement  will increase and those products carry shorter warranty periods thus containing the opportunity for increased maintenance contracts 
despite focusing on emc products  we will continue to support and service our current customer base on both our mti branded raid controller technology and our partnered independent storage technology 
we believe that we can differentiate ourselves through our ability to offer umbrella services on a wide range of storage products covering online storage  replicated site environments and data protections from the leading technology companies 
in addition  we became a member of the emc authorized services network and will provide end to end service for emc s clariion family of systems 
we also enhanced the value of our storage solutions through our xx support and service infrastructure  which includes an international network of over on site field engineers and a solution and integration test laboratory  and our global call response centers 
service revenue was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to our inability to fully offset lost revenue from maintenance contract that expired with revenue from renewed and new maintenance contracts 
the lower number of renewals was attributable to the loss of customers to competitors during the fiscal year 
due to concerns about our financial position  existing customers were more reluctant to renew their maintenance contracts 
product gross profit 
product gross profit was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage of net product sales was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to continued pricing pressures and changes in product mix 
in fiscal year  we sold more library and software products than server products  particularly the vivant product family  and library and software products carry lower margins than server products 
the unfavorable change in product mix was partially offset by improved manufacturing efficiencies  our ability to sell million of non vivant inventory that was previously fully reserved and reduced inventory charges from million  which consisted primarily of additional reserves for gladiator  and inventories  in the fiscal year to million  which consisted primarily of reserves for vivant  vcache and s  in fiscal year product gross profit was million for fiscal year  a decrease of million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage of net product sales was for fiscal year as compared to for fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to additional inventory reserves of million in the first quarter and million in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  which consisted primarily of additional reserves for gladiator  and inventories 
furthermore  increased pricing competition and reduced manufacturing efficiencies resulting from lower production volumes as well as changes in product mix contributed to the lower product gross margin 
although our restructuring activities are designed to lower our cost structure and increase product gross profit at lower production volumes  there can be no assurance that such activities will be successful 
in addition  product gross profit may decline further in connection with our shift to integrated third party products  as we may face increased pricing competition for such products from a greater number of competitors selling the same third party products 
service gross profit 
service gross profit for fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage for service revenue was in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year in addition to the relatively fixed cost structure  we attribute the decreases in service gross profit to a decrease in domestic customer service revenue  particularly maintenance revenue  partially offset by a increase in international customer service revenue 
in an effort to improve our service gross profit  the following actions were taken as of march   we have become part of emc s authorized service network 
as a result  we will be part of a worldwide network of professional service organization enabling us to offer enhanced service and consulting capabilities to our customers  effective march   we outsourced our non prime time hours domestic crc operations to center  inc for a fixed monthly charge of million 
we are considering outsourcing additional crc operations in an attempt to further reduce fixed charges for labor and benefits 
to benefit from 
table of contents fixed price repairs  we also outsourced our parts repair center 
our logistics function is now focused on the supply of spare parts to field personnel 
these actions resulted in eliminating full time employees from the domestic customer service department 
the cash outflow of million related to severance was paid during the fourth quarter of fiscal service gross profit for fiscal year increased million  or  from fiscal year the gross profit percentage for service revenue was in fiscal year  as compared to for fiscal year the increase in service gross profit was primarily attributable to decreased infrastructure costs resulting from reduced manpower  mandatory pay cuts  mandatory vacations and travel related expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
in fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  over fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to a or million decrease in salary and benefit expenses which resulted from reduced headcounts of  a or million decrease in outside purchases such as consulting and professional services  tax services  bank fees and bad debt expense  a or million decrease in marketing and promotional expenses  an or million decrease in fixed charges such as rent and utilities expenses  a or million decrease in supplies and telecommunication expenses  and a or million decrease in travel and lodging expenses 
during fiscal year  we recovered million from accounts that were previously determined to be uncollectible  as compared to bad debt expense of million in the preceding fiscal year 
the decreased expenditures were the result of a directed program to bring expenditures in line with the reduced product and service revenues and resultant margins noted above 
selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal year decreased million  or  over fiscal year the decrease was due to reductions in salary and benefit expenses of million resulting from reduced headcounts  elimination of amortization of goodwill of million  reduction in bad debt expense of million  reduction in communication and freight charges of million  reduction in marketing and promotional expenses of million  reduction in professional and consulting fees of million  and reduction in travel and lodging expenses of million 
please see critical accounting policies for greater detail regarding goodwill accounting 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses in fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year these decreases were primarily attributable to decreases in salary and benefit expenses of million resulting from a headcount reduction over fiscal year  decreases in project costs of million  decreases in rent  utilities  repair and maintenance expenses  depreciation  insurance and property tax expenses of million  decreases in travel and lodging  consulting and loss on disposal of fixed assets of million  and decreases in communication expenses of million 
as part of our restructuring activities  we anticipated changing our emphasis from the sale of mti branded products to the sale of co branded solutions serving the storage and enhanced data protection market 
our focus towards emc networked storage systems will result in limited partnering of products beyond the emc line of products and those products related to backup functions 
the primary goal of the restructuring was to refocus on the design and implementation of storage solutions at a significantly lower cost 
in support of this  our engineering department has been redeployed within our professional services organization 
during fiscal these costs will be incorporated into our professional services expenditures thus eliminating a separate research and development expenditure 
as such  we believe that our research and development expense will substantially decrease in fiscal year research and development expenses in fiscal year decreased million  or  from fiscal year the decrease was primarily due to headcount reductions  substantially lower project costs  reduced travel and lodging expenses and consulting fees 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we abandoned our under utilized research and development facility in sunnyvale  california  and consolidated our research and development activities in the anaheim  california and westmont  illinois facilities 
restructuring 
we recorded a million restructuring charge in the first quarter of fiscal year  which consisted of charges of approximately million related to a headcount reduction of employees  or of our workforce  and million related to the disposal or abandonment of fixed assets 
of the 
table of contents employees terminated       and were from the sales  marketing  general and administrative  customer service  research and development  and manufacturing departments  respectively 
the cash outflow of the restructuring charge is million related to severance  which was paid during fiscal year in the third quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million restructuring charge due to lower than anticipated lease payments from sub lessees in our sunnyvale  california and raleigh  north carolina facilities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we recorded a million restructuring charge due to lower than anticipated lease payments from sub lessees in our european facilities 
we also completed consolidating our manufacturing facility to dublin  ireland  in july  and reduced the amount of space leased for our corporate headquarters by moving from anaheim  california to tustin  california in january the changes to the restructuring reserve established in the fourth quarter of fiscal year are as follows in millions abandoned facilities balance as of april  add current year restructuring charges less current year utilization balance as of april  workforce reduction balance as of april  add current year severance charges less current year severance payments balance as of april  total accrued restructuring  as of april  other income  net 
other income  net  which includes interest income and expense  in fiscal year decreased million  or  over fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to an absence of income from sale of patents to emc as we received the final annual payment in advance of million from the sale of certain patents in january and recorded the payments as other income proportionately during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the first nine months of fiscal year thus  we recorded other income of related to the sale of patents in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year other factors contributing to the decrease in other income  net  were decreases in interest income and sales tax refund 
these decreases were partially offset by a gain on the sale of a security investment of million in fiscal year other income  net in fiscal year decreased million  or  over fiscal year this decrease was primarily due to decreased income from emc as we received the final annual payment in advance of million from the sale of certain patents in fiscal and recorded the payments as other income proportionately during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and the first nine months of fiscal year  coupled with a decrease in interest expense 
we recorded other income related to the sale of patents of million in fiscal year  as compared to million in fiscal year these decreases were partially offset by a favorable sales tax refund of million in fiscal year equity in net loss and write down of net investment of affiliate 
equity in net loss of affiliate represents our proportionate share of sco s net losses and amortization of the goodwill related to the investment made in sco in august the original investment in sco was million and included a cash payment of million  b note payable of million bearing interest at the prime rate plus one percent per annum and payable in two equal semi annual payments beginning february and c investment costs of million  including the issuance of a warrant to purchase  shares of our 
table of contents common stock 
the excess of our investment in sco over the related underlying equity in net assets of million was being amortized on a straight line basis over seven years 
however  we adopted statement as of april   the beginning of fiscal year  and therefore  ceased to amortize the remaining balance of goodwill related to the investment in sco of million  which was written off during the third quarter of fiscal year due to an other than temporary decline in value and recognizing our proportional share of sco s net loss 
such loss has been included in equity in net loss and write down of net investment of affiliate in our fiscal year consolidated statement of operations 
gain loss on foreign currency transactions 
we recorded a million gain on foreign currency transactions during fiscal year  as compare to a million loss in fiscal year the million increase in the gain on foreign currency transactions was primarily due to the weakening us dollar against the euro 
income taxes 
we recorded a net tax expense of million for fiscal year  as compared to a net tax expense of million for fiscal year in fiscal year  we recorded a net tax expense of million of which million was related to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets recorded in the first quarter of fiscal year because of the continued decline in the market value of our investment in sco and continued softness in the domestic and european markets for our products  management believed that it was more likely than not that we would not realize the benefits of the net deferred tax assets existing on april  liquidity and capital resources we had cash and cash equivalents of million as of april  and million as of april  net operating activities provided cash of million in fiscal year  an increase in cash generated from operating activities of million as compared to fiscal year this was primarily due to reduced net losses from million in fiscal year to million in fiscal year the net loss was partially offset by non cash expenses of million and cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
net investing activities provided cash of million primarily as a result of the sale of our investment in sco 
as of june   we had cash and cash equivalents of approximately million 
net cash used by financing activities was million due to total borrowings on notes payable of million and total payments of notes payable of million  capital lease payments of million  offset by cash provided by the issuance of treasury shares of million 
due to recurring decreases in revenues  we are operating at lower accounts receivable and inventory levels  resulting in reduced available working capital 
as of april   working capital was million  as compared to million at the end of the prior fiscal year 
we believe our new relationship with emc will be successful and  as a result  the relationship will position us to grow our product revenues in the mid range storage market 
in this new relationship  sales order backlog could become significant 
as of april   our order backlog was million 
emc ends its fiscal quarters a week ahead of us and a significant portion of our sales generally occur in the last month and weeks of a given quarter 
consequently  if emc is unable to assemble  test and ship orders on a timely basis or if all orders received within one quarter are shipped leaving no backlog for future quarters  our quarter to quarter performance could be negatively affected 
effective february   we entered into the emc asset purchase agreement with emc in which we sold to emc substantially all of our existing patents  patent applications and related rights 
we were entitled to receive million over the life of the emc asset purchase agreement 
the final payment of million was received in january we also were entitled to receive royalty payments in the aggregate of up to a maximum of million over the term of the emc asset purchase agreement 
as part of the maximum million in royalties  minimum royalties of million were to be received in five annual installments  beginning within days of the first anniversary of the effective date of the emc asset purchase agreement  and within days of each subsequent anniversary thereof 
as of march 
table of contents  we had received all such installments 
also  as a result of a computer and technology agreement between emc and ibm announced in march  the minimum royalties of million were to be increased to million 
payments were to be received under the emc asset purchase agreement in five equal annual installments 
we received the first three annual installments in march  march and march on april   prior to fiscal year end  we entered into an amended asset purchase agreement with emc pursuant to which emc agreed to pay to us million which fully satisfied obligations of emc under the original agreement 
the payment was received on april  future periods will not benefit from any additional payments  which have amounted to approximately million of cash receipts in prior years  under the asset purchase agreement 
also  we granted emc immunity from suit for patent infringement with respect to our patents 
the company s principal source of liquidity is cash and cash equivalents  cash flows from operations and the comerica line of credit under the comerica loan agreement  which was to mature on october   but on june   the company received a renewal on the line of credit for million until may  the line of credit is secured by a letter of credit that is guaranteed by canopy 
the canopy guarantee was to mature on november   but on june   we received an extension on the letter of credit for million until june  we believe that revenues and margins are at sustainable levels and working capital  coupled with the borrowing ability under the comerica line of credit  is adequate to fund operations for at least the next twelve months 
however  in general  resellers of third party manufactured products sell such products at margins significantly lower than would be experienced if they were the original manufacturers of the products 
as product margins decrease  there is a need to sell substantially more products to achieve the same product margin dollars 
additionally  under the emc agreement  products other than software are generally sold with a two year warranty and  therefore we expect that our service revenue base will decrease as a result 
if we are not able to renew the existing service contracts  we expect that our cash receipts will decrease 
if product revenues and margins continue to decrease or we are not able to replace expiring service maintenance contracts with other forms of service revenues and or are not able to reduce our operating expenses  we may have to seek additional financing alternatives such as additional bank borrowings and or public or private offerings of equity or debt securities 
no assurance can be given that additional sources of financing will be available or that if available  such financing will be on terms favorable to us 
if additional sources of financing are not available  we intend to implement additional measures to conserve cash and reduce costs  which may include  among other things  making additional cost reductions 
however  there is no assurance that such measures would be successful 
see factors that may affect future results we may need additional financing to continue to carry on our existing operations  and such additional financing may not be available 
the following represents a comprehensive list of our contractual obligations and commitments as of april  payments due by period total thereafter in millions note payable capital and operating lease obligations loan agreement on december   we paid off the outstanding million loan with the canopy group  inc canopy  our major shareholder  and terminated our loan agreement 
the canopy loan agreement was entered into on june   allowing us to borrow up to an aggregate of million at an interest rate of nine percent per annum under a revolving line of credit 
the line was secured by a security interest in substantially all of mti s unencumbered assets 
ralph j 
yarro  iii  one of our directors  is also a director  president and chief executive officer of canopy 
darcy g 
mott  one of our directors  is also a vice 
table of contents president  treasurer and chief financial officer of canopy 
canopy beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
in november  we entered into an agreement with comerica bank for a line of credit of million at an interest rate equal to the prime rate 
the line of credit is secured by a letter of credit that is guaranteed by canopy 
canopy s guarantee was to mature on november   but on june   we received an extension on the letter of credit for million until june  the comerica bank loan agreement was to mature on october   but on june   we received a renewal on the line of credit for million until may  the comerica bank loan agreement contains negative covenants placing restrictions on our ability to engage in any business other than the businesses currently engaged in  suffer or permit a change in control  and merge with or acquire another entity 
although we are currently in compliance with all of the terms of the comerica bank loan agreement  and believe that we will remain in compliance  there can be no assurance that we will be able to borrow under the comerica bank loan agreement 
upon an event of default  comerica bank may terminate the comerica bank loan agreement and declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable 
as of april   there was million outstanding under the comerica bank loan agreement 
if our product and service revenue and related margins decline further  there could be an adverse effect on cash flow and working capital 
should that occur  there can be no assurance that existing or additional financing sources would be available 
new accounting standards not yet adopted the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued statement  accounting for asset retirement obligations  addressing financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
statement requires an enterprise to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of a tangible long lived asset

inflation and foreign currency exchange we recorded a million in foreign exchange gain during fiscal year  which resulted from the weakening us dollar against the euro 
in order to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  we have used hedging programs  currency forward contracts  currency options and or other derivative financial instruments commonly used to reduce financial market risks 
as of april   we have an outstanding forward contract to purchase euro million 
there can be no assurance  however  that such actions successfully will reduce our exposure to financial market risks 
factors that may affect future results the non historical information in this form k constitute forward looking statements and involve risks and uncertainties 
these statements relate to our future plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
these statements may be identified by the use of words such as believes  expects  may  will  should  seeks  anticipates  intends  plans and similar expressions 
our actual results may differ materially from those discussed in these statements 
the sections entitled factors that may affect future results  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business contain a discussion of some of the factors that could contribute to those differences 
factors that could contribute to these differences include those discussed below and elsewhere in this form k 
we are exposed to general economic conditions 
our business depends on general economic and business conditions 
continued softness in the information technology market in both the us and in europe and consumers uncertainty about the global economic condition could result in reduced demand for our products and services 
as a result of the weakened global economy  consumers are postponing or reducing expenditures  causing our revenue  our operating results  and our financial condition to decline 
the downturn also has led to restructuring actions 
further delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services  and thus  our operating results 
we cannot predict the result of our recent transition from a manufacturer to a solutions provider 
during fiscal year  we took steps to transition away from manufacturing and engineering of our proprietary products to reselling best of class third party storage solutions 
on march   we entered into a reseller agreement with emc  in which we sell the complete line of emc automated networked storage systems and software 
in addition  we become a member of the emc authorized services network and will provide end to end service for emc s clariion family of systems 
the emc reseller agreement will enable us to provide what we believe to be the best in class storage solutions from their partnerships with leading disk and software manufacturers 
we may be unable to leverage our new emc partnership effectively and achieve the expected growth in our revenue 
we may be unsuccessful in differentiating ourselves from our 
table of contents competitors by emphasizing our service and support capabilities and could lose customers to the extent they have concerns about our financial viability 
we may face increased competition for our services  especially with respect to customers purchasing third party products  who may perceive other companies as having comparable or greater expertise with respect to such services 
additionally  we currently sell emc hardware products with up to year xx warranties and emc software products with day warranties 
as a result  the amount of service contracts associated with those hardware product sales is expected to decrease in value 
thus  depending upon the conversion of our current customer base to emc products from mti proprietary products  service revenues may decrease 
our gross margins are most likely to decrease as we transition from selling mti proprietary products to becoming a reseller of emc and other third party manufacturers requiring an increase in revenues 
we may not be able to attain such volumes to ensure profitable operations 
in general  resellers of third party manufacturers products sell such products at margins significantly lower than would be experienced if they were the original manufacturers of the products 
as product revenue margins decrease  there is a need to sell substantially more products to achieve the same product margin dollars 
in such cases  to continue to achieve and sustain profitable operations  the decrease in product margin dollars must be offset by increased product sales volume  increased service revenues which are typically generated on a higher margin basis  lower operating expenses  or a combination of all of the above 
we are dependent upon emc as the main supplier for our disk based storage products  and disruptions in supply or significant increases in costs could harm our business materially 
effective march   we became a reseller of emc disk based storage products 
therefore  we depend on emc to manufacture and supply us with their storage products 
we may fail to obtain required storage products in a timely manner or to obtain it in the quantities we desire in the future 
if emc were to decide to modify their channel strategy  they may cease supplying us with their storage products 
if emc were to unexpectedly cancel the reseller agreement  we may be unable to find other vendors as a replacement in a timely manner 
any interruption or delay in the supply of emc storage products  or the inability to obtain these products at acceptable prices and within a reasonable amount of time  would impair our ability to meet scheduled product deliveries to our customers and could cause customers to cancel orders 
this lost storage product revenue could harm our business  financial condition and operating results rendering us unable to continue operation at our current level of operations 
the storage market is characterized by rapid technological change  and our success will depend on emc s ability to develop new products 
the market for data storage products is characterized by rapid technology changes 
the market is sensitive to changes in customer demands and very competitive with respect to timely innovation 
new product introductions representing new or improved technology or industry standards may cause our existing products to be obsolete 
when we became a reseller of emc disk based storage products  we agreed to not sell data storage hardware platforms that compete with emc products  emc s ability to introduce new or enhanced products into the market on a timely basis at competitive price levels will affect our future results 
our future operating results may depend on the success of our restructuring program 
we have implemented restructuring activities in an effort to reduce costs 
these measures included reductions in our workforce and the elimination of certain under utilized facilities  including offices in sunnyvale  california  boston  massachusetts  austin  texas  denver  colorado  orlando  florida  westmont  illinois and raleigh  north carolina 
we reduced the number of our full time employees by approximately within the last two fiscal years from on april  to as of june  
our restructuring may fail to reduce expenses significantly enough to compensate for decreases in margin and revenue 
please see significant business developments financial restructuring 

table of contents we cannot predict with any certainty the long term impact of our workforce reductions 
reductions in our workforce could negatively impact our financial condition and results of operations  as well as make it difficult to motivate and retain the remaining employees  which would affect our ability to deliver our products in a timely fashion and otherwise negatively affect our business 
we also cannot assure you that these measures will be successful in achieving the expected benefits within the expected time frames or that the workforce reductions will not impair our ability to achieve our current or future business objectives 
we may need additional financing to continue to carry on our existing operations  and such additional financing may not be available 
we require substantial working capital to fund our operations 
we use cash generated from our operations  equity capital and bank financings to fund capital expenditures  as well as to invest in and operate our existing operations 
we believe that our working capital  cash flow from operating activities and amounts available under the comerica loan agreement will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months assuming we will be able to achieve sufficient revenues and margins 
however  comerica may terminate the comerica loan agreement and declare all amounts outstanding immediately due and payable upon an event of default 
if the comerica loan agreement were terminated and all outstanding amounts declared immediately due and payable  we would require additional financing 
also  the comerica bank loan agreement was to mature on october   but on june   we received a renewal on the line of credit for million until may  the line of credit is secured by a letter of credit that is guaranteed by canopy 
the canopy guarantee was to mature on november   but on june   we received an extension on the letter of credit for million until june  in addition  projections for our capital requirements are subject to numerous uncertainties  including the cost savings expected to be realized from the restructuring  the amount of service and product revenue generated in fiscal and general economic conditions 
as of the fourth quarter of fiscal year  we started to realize the cost savings from the restructuring activities that have taken place to date resulting in fourth quarter operating income of million 
however  there can be no assurance that we will continue to realize those cost savings 
also  in the longer term  if we do not continue to realize substantial cost savings from our restructuring and achieve profitability  we will require additional funds in order to carry on our operations  and may seek to raise such funds through bank borrowings or public or private offerings of equity or debt securities or from other sources 
no assurance can be given that additional financing will be available or that  if available  will be on terms favorable to us 
if additional financing is required but not available to us  we would have to implement additional measures to conserve cash and reduce costs  which may include  among other things  making additional cost reductions 
however  there is no assurance that such measures would be successful 
our failure to raise required additional funds or to secure an additional credit facility would adversely affect our ability to maintain or enhance our product offerings  respond to competitive pressures  or continue operations 
additional funds raised through the issuance of equity securities or securities convertible into our common stock may have the following negative effects on the then current holders of our common stock dilution in percentage of ownership in mti  and subordination of the rights  preferences or privileges of common stockholders to the rights  preferences or privileges of new security holders 

table of contents in fiscal  we received a million royalty payment from emc as a result of the emc sale of patents and that was the final payment to be received under the emc asset purchase agreement 
if we are not able to substitute the cash receipts from that royalty payment by increases in product and service revenues and related margins  our operations and liquidity could be adversely affected 
pursuant to the february  emc asset purchase agreement  we sold to emc substantially all of our then existing patents  patent applications  and related rights 
as part of the maximum million in royalties  minimum royalties of million were to be received in five annual installments  beginning within days of the first anniversary of the effective date of the emc asset purchase agreement  and within days of each subsequent anniversary thereof 
as of march  we had received all installments 
also  as a result of a computer and technology agreement between emc and ibm announced in march  the minimum royalties of million were to be increased to million 
payments were to be received under the emc asset purchase agreement in five equal annual installments 
we received the first three annual installments in march  march and march on april   we entered into an amended asset purchase agreement with emc  under which emc paid us million  which satisfied all obligations of emc under the original agreement 
also  we granted emc immunity from suit for patent infringement with respect to our patents 
we do not expect to receive any further royalty payments from the emc asset purchase agreement nor  currently  from other patent and licensing agreements 
therefore  we do not expect that we will be receiving royalty payments in fiscal and the lost revenue of million and lost cash flow of million could materially  adversely affect our operations and liquidity unless we can find substitute revenue and cash sources such as sufficient increased product and service revenues and margins 
a significant portion of our revenues occurs in the last month  weeks and days of a given quarter 
consequently  our results of operations for that quarter may be difficult to predict 
we have experienced  historically  a significant portion of our orders  sales and shipments in the last month or weeks of each quarter 
we expect this pattern to continue  and possibly to increase  in the future 
this uneven pattern makes our ability to forecast revenues  earnings and working capital requirements for each quarter extremely difficult and uncertain 
if we do not receive orders that we have anticipated or complete shipments within a given quarter  our results of operations could be harmed materially for that quarter 
due to the new relationship with emc and based on our current revenue level  we may operate with a more significant backlog than in prior periods and expect that order backlog will be an important indicator of our future success 
additionally  due to receiving a significant portion of our orders in the last month of the quarter  we may experience a situation in which we have exceeded our credit limits with our vendors thereby making our ability to ship to our customers impossible 
if we experience such situations and are unable to extend our credit limits with our vendors  this could materially harm our results of operations 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive which may lead to reduced sales of our products  reduced profits and reduced market share for our business 
the markets for our products and services are intensely competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
if we fail to maintain or enhance our competitive position  we could experience pricing pressures and reduced sales  margins  profits and market share  each of which could materially harm our business 
furthermore  new products and technologies developed by third parties  may depress the sales of existing products and technologies 
our customers requirements and the technology available to satisfy those requirements are continually changing 
therefore  we must be able to respond to these changes in order to remain competitive 
since we have placed total emphasis on integrating third party products  our ability to respond to new technologies will be substantially dependent upon our contractual relationships with such manufacturers 
in addition  we must be able to quickly and effectively train our employees with respect to any new products or technologies developed by our third party suppliers and resold by us 
since the third party 
table of contents products we sell are available from a large number of sources  we must distinguish ourselves by the quality of our service and support 
the principal elements of competition in our markets include quality of service and support  responsiveness to customer and market needs  product price  quality  reliability and performance  and ability to sell  service and deploy new technology 
we have a number of competitors in various markets  including hewlett packard  sun microsystems  ibm  and network appliance  each of which has substantially greater name recognition  marketing capabilities  financial  technological  and personnel resources than we do 
our quarterly results may fluctuate from period to period 
therefore  historical results may not be indicative of future results or be helpful in evaluating the results of our business 
we have experienced quarterly fluctuations in operating results and we anticipate that these fluctuations may continue into the future 
these fluctuations have resulted from  and may continue to be caused by  a number of factors  including the introduction of new products by our competitors and competitive pricing pressures  the size  timing and terms of customer orders  the timing of the introduction of new products and new versions of best of breed products  shifts in our product or services mix  changes in our operating expenditures  the timing of sales  marketing research and development expenditures  and decreases in our gross profit as a percentage of revenues for mature products 
accordingly  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indications of our future performance 
we cannot assure you that we will be profitable on a quarter to quarter basis or that our future revenues and operating results will meet or exceed the expectations of securities analysts and investors  any of which could cause a significant adverse change in the trading price of our common stock 
the success of our business depends upon our ability to sell new products on a timely basis 
we believe that our ability to sell  deploy and service new  innovative products with features that respond to our customers changing demands and that incorporate new technological standards will be critical to our future success 
we are dependent upon our ability to contract with manufacturers to sell their existing products  as well as new product introductions that address customer needs or achieve market acceptance 
any significant delay or failure by us to update our product offerings  train our staff to support and service such products or effectively manage the transitions to new products or new technologies could harm our business materially 
our solutions are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors that could be difficult  costly  and time consuming to repair 
undetected software or hardware errors frequently occur in networking products when they are first introduced or as new versions of products are released 
our solutions are complex and are a combination of products from the third party manufacturers whose products we represent and sell  and from time to time there may be errors in these products 
these errors could adversely affect our sales  
table of contents cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  cause significant customer relations problems  harm our competitive position  hurt our reputation  and cause purchase delays 
any of these effects could materially harm our business or results of operations 
all domestic employment at mti  including employment of our domestic key personnel  is at will 
both mti us and its us employees have the right to terminate employment at any time  with or without advance notice  and with or without cause 
we believe that our success is dependent  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of our salespeople  technical staff and senior management team  particularly our executive officers 
the loss of the services of our key personnel  especially to our competitors  could materially harm our business 
the failure to retain key personnel  or to implement a succession plan to prepare qualified individuals to join us upon the loss of a member of our key personnel  could materially harm our business 
we are subject to financial and operating risks associated with international sales and services 
international sales and services represent a significant portion of our total revenue 
international sales and service revenue represented of our total sales and service revenue for fiscal year if we are unable to maintain international market demand for our products and services  our results of operations could be materially harmed 
our international business is subject to the financial and operating risks of conducting business internationally  including unexpected changes in  or impositions of  legislative or regulatory requirements  fluctuating exchange rates  tariffs and other barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign subsidiary operations  import or export restrictions  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection and longer payment cycles  potentially adverse tax consequences  potential hostilities and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  changes in a country s economic or political conditions  and differing customer and or technology standards requirements 
all of our sales and services in international markets are priced in the applicable local currencies and are subject to currency exchange rate fluctuations 
from time to time  we enter into foreign currency exchange contracts on a limited basis in an attempt to minimize foreign currency exposure 
such contracts can be costly or limited in their effectiveness 
if we are faced with significant changes in the regulatory and business climate in our international markets  our business and results of operations could suffer 
war and terrorist activities could adversely affect our business 
the continued threat of terrorism within the us and europe and the acts of war may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  delays in collecting cash  a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology  or our inability to effectively market  manufacture or ship our products  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are unable to predict whether the act of war and the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long term commercial disruptions 
table of contents or if such activities or responses will have any long term material adverse effect on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may have difficulty managing any future growth effectively 
we believe our new emc relationship positions us to grow in the mid range storage market because emc is the leading disk subsystem vendor and both companies are pure play storage providers  accustomed to selling and servicing similar customer bases  supporting mission critical environments  providing fully integrated value added solutions and offering xx support on those installations 
our facilities  personnel and operating and financial systems may not be sufficient to effectively manage our future growth and  as a result  we may lose our ability to respond to new opportunities promptly 
additionally  our expected revenue growth may not materialize and increases in our operating expenses in response to the expected revenue growth may harm our operating results and financial condition 
as a reseller of third party products  we are susceptible to factors that may affect their future results of operations 
as we transition away from manufacturing and engineering  a majority of our future sales will be sales of third party products 
as such  we are open to the risk factors affecting our vendors results of operations including  but not limited to their business could continue to be adversely affected by the general economic conditions and or the decreasing demand in the information technology market  failure to keep pace with the rapid industry and technological changes  failure to be competitive in terms of product pricing  research and development efforts may not be successful  inability to compete effectively or meet future capital requirements  suppliers may not be able to meet their requirements  difficulty to manage their operation or any future growth  inability to retain or attract key personnel  financial difficulty  business could be adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with acquisitions  investments  alliances  litigation and changes in regulations  and business may suffer if they cannot protect their intellectual property  we may face inherent costly damages or litigation costs if third parties claim that the products we sell infringe upon their intellectual property rights 
our business activities may infringe upon the proprietary rights of others  and other parties may assert infringement claims against us 
though the majority of our future product sales will be third party products  and the applicable third party manufacturers will defend their own intellectual property rights  in the event such claims are made against our suppliers  we may be faced with a situation in which we cannot sell the products and thus our results of operations could be significantly adversely affected 
in addition  in the future  we may receive communications from other parties asserting that our own intellectual property infringes on their proprietary rights 
if we become liable to any third party for infringing its intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay substantial damage awards and to develop non infringing technology  obtain licenses  or to cease selling the applications that contain the infringing intellectual property 
litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and any outcome unfavorable to us could materially harm our business 
furthermore  we could incur substantial costs in defending against any intellectual property litigation  and these costs could increase significantly if any dispute were to go to trial 
our defense of any litigation  regardless of the merits of 
table of contents the complaint  likely would be time consuming  costly  and a distraction to our management personnel 
adverse publicity related to any intellectual property litigation also could harm the sale of our products and damage our competitive position 
if we and or our partners are unable to comply with evolving industry standards and government regulations  we may be unable either to sell our solutions or to be competitive in the marketplace 
our solutions must comply with current industry standards and government regulations in the us and internationally 
any new products and product enhancements that we sell in the future also must meet industry standards and government regulations at the time they are introduced 
failure to comply with existing or evolving industry standards or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals could materially harm our business 
in addition  such compliance may be time consuming and costly 
our solutions integrate san and nas technologies into single storage architecture 
components of the san and nas must comply with evolving industry standards 
we also depend upon our supporters that provide us with products to sell to meet these standards 
if our suppliers or customers do not support the same industry standards that we do  or if competing standards emerge that we do not support  market acceptance of our products could suffer 
our stock ownership is concentrated in a single stockholder  and other stockholders may not be able to influence corporate decisions 
ralph j 
yarro iii  one of our directors  is also the director and president and chief executive officer of canopy which beneficially owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
canopy is able to substantially affect our actions which require stockholder approval  including the election of the board of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership may delay or prevent a change in control of the company and will make some transactions difficult or impossible without canopy s support 
our stock price may be volatile  which could lead to losses by investors and to securities litigation 
the value of an investment in our company could decline due to the impact of any of the following factors upon the market price of our common stock variations between our actual and anticipated earnings  the timing and announcement of new products or services by us  our partners or by our competitors  services or technological innovations by us  our partners or by our competitors  failure of our results from operations to meet the expectations of public market analysts and investors  changes in revenue or earnings estimates by the investment community  speculation in the press or investment community about our business or our competitive position  the volume of trading in our common stock  and market conditions broadly and the trading price of shares of technology companies generally 
in addition  stock markets  particularly the nasdaq smallcap market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  and the market prices of securities of companies such as ours have been highly volatile 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
fluctuations such as these may affect the market price of our common stock 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often been instituted against companies following periods of volatility in their stock price 
this type of litigation could result in substantial costs and could divert our management s attention and resources 

table of contents we may fail to comply with nasdaq marketplace rules 
our securities have been trading on the nasdaq smallcap market since august  in order to maintain our listing with nasdaq smallcap market  we have to meet its continued listing requirements  one of which is to avoid our stock bid price falling below per share for consecutive trading days 
recently  our stock has been trading in a range close to per share 
therefore  we may once again fail to comply with the minimum bid price requirement  or other continued listing requirements of the nasdaq smallcap market 
if that happens and we do not regain compliance by the end of the applicable grace period to regain compliance  our stock will be delisted and we would likely seek listing of our common stock on the over the counter market  which is viewed by many investors as a less liquid marketplace 
as a result  the price per share of our common stock would likely decrease materially and  the trading market for our common stock  our ability to issue additional securities and our ability to secure additional financing would likely be materially and adversely affected 
we have adopted anti takeover defenses that could affect the price of our common stock 
our restated certificate of incorporation and amended and restated bylaws contain various provisions  including notice provisions  provisions for staggered terms of office of the board of directors  and provisions authorizing us to issue preferred stock  that may make it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or may discourage acquisition bids for  our company 
also  the rights of holders of our common stock may be affected adversely by the rights of holders of any preferred stock that we may issue in the future that would be senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock 
furthermore  we are subject to the provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law regulating corporate takeovers 
these provisions could also limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our european operations transact in foreign currencies and may be exposed to financial market risk resulting from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  particularly the british pound sterling and the euro 
we have and may continue to utilize hedging programs  currency forward contracts  currency options and or other derivative financial instruments commonly used to reduce financial market risks 
as of april   we have an outstanding forward contract to purchase euro million 
there can be no assurance that such actions will successfully reduce our exposure to financial market risks 
our exposure to short term interest rate fluctuations is limited to our short term borrowings under our line of credit 
our line of credit allows borrowings up to million and therefore a increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by million
