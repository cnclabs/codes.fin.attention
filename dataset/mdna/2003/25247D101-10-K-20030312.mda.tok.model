customers our products are sold throughout the united states primarily through supermarkets  mass merchandisers  drug stores  membership club stores and other outlets

table of contents sales sales within the united states were  and of our total sales during   and  respectively 
our customers are served by a national sales organization of approximately employees 
the sales organization is divided into regional divisions and account teams for grocery sales and specialized sales operations that sell to large mass merchandisers  membership club stores  chain drug stores  vending and military customers 
in addition  some customers and regions are served by a national sales and marketing agency 
the following table sets forth our us net sales by channel food mass dollar  club and drug commercial markets and other total us net sales includes all private label and copack food products that are sold through the food channel 
our international customers are served by salespeople at three foreign sales offices  consisting of employees 
in addition  independent distributors also service some regions 
distribution we ship products from four domestic distribution centers 
the distribution centers are operated by third parties  except for one distribution center that we operate 
outside carriers are used to transport our products 
we also shipped full truckload quantities directly to customers from our manufacturing facilities 
direct shipment to customers is limited to certain high volume products  such as purex liquid laundry detergent 
the percent of tonnage shipped direct from our plants to our customers was approximately  and in   and  respectively 
suppliers we rely on a number of third parties for manufacturing  packaging and research and development 
some of our arrangements related to new products contain limited mutual exclusivity provisions 
this is designed to permit the supplier and us to profit from the product enhancement or innovation before we use an alternative supplier or the supplier sells to one of our competitors 
most of our supplier arrangements can be terminated without material penalties 
currently  we rely on a single company owned plant to manufacture our dial bar soap  a single contract manufacturer for our renuzit adjustable products and a single supplier for purex liquid laundry detergent bottles 
if any of these plants or suppliers were unable to produce these products for us for an extended period of time  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
raw materials we believe that ample sources of raw materials are available with respect to all of our major products 
paper  fats and oils  detergent chemicals  resins used in manufacturing bottles and meat have the most significant impact on our costs 
generally  we purchase these raw materials from a variety of suppliers in the united states 
increases in the prices of certain raw materials could materially impact our profit margins and financial results 
for example  tallow a key ingredient in dial bar soaps has experienced price fluctuations within the range of to per pound from january   to december  recently  the price of tallow has been trading at the middle of this historical range 
if prices were to increase  we may not be able to increase the prices of our dial bar soaps to offset these increases 
in addition  because our competitors use 
table of contents less tallow in their bar soap products  increases in tallow prices would adversely impact us more than our competitors 
for the first quarter of  we have entered into an agreement with our supplier that fixes the price we pay for tallow 
we attempt to reduce our risk by entering into contracts to provide six to twelve month supplies of tallow  other raw materials and packaging materials 
in the past  we have used financial derivatives to mitigate price fluctuations on the raw material component of the cardboard boxes and packaging used in our business 
other long term hedging opportunities against price increases for these raw materials are generally not available 
competition we compete primarily on the basis of brand equity  brand advertising  customer service  product performance and product quality at competitive retail price points 
we compete with numerous  well established local  regional  national and international companies 
some of these companies have greater financial resources than we do and may be willing to commit significant resources to protect their own market shares or to capture market share from us 
our principal competitors are as follows personal cleansing food products the procter gamble company p g hormel foods corp 
lever brothers co  a division of unilever plc lever conagra colgate palmolive company colgate laundry care air fresheners p g sc johnson son  inc lever reckitt benckiser  inc colgate church dwight  inc church dwight  inc global household brands sc johnson son  inc reckitt benckiser  inc research and development we conduct research and development at our facility in scottsdale  arizona 
our internal research and development efforts are primarily directed at providing technical assistance  supporting our manufacturing activities and generating innovation for new and existing products 
to increase our innovative capacity  we also contract general research and development activities in areas beyond our core areas of expertise 
our total research and development expenditures were approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
marketing research we rely on industry data  syndicated market share data and various attitude and usage studies prepared by independent marketing firms 
we also obtain direct sales information from our largest customers to identify consumer needs and anticipate shifts in consumer preferences 
this allows us to develop line extensions and new products to meet changing demands 
patents and trademarks our trademarks include dial  purex  renuzit  coast  zout  armour  armour star  tone  pure natural  trend  treet  mule team and boraxo in addition to related trade names 
in the us  we license the armour and armour star trademarks from conagra  inc  which also sells food products under the armour trademark 
we license the mule team trademark from us borax  inc 
table of contents in  we licensed our breck trademarks in the us  canada  puerto rico  europe and asia to a third party in exchange for a royalty based upon gross sales

for further discussion of our licensing arrangement in mexico  see item business international 
united states trademark registrations are for a term of years  renewable every years as long as the trademarks are used in the regular course of trade 
we maintain a portfolio of trademarks representing substantial goodwill in the businesses using these trademarks 
we also have a significant number of registered foreign trademarks 
united states patents are currently granted for a term of years from the date a patent application is filed 
we own a number of patents and believe that some of them may provide competitive advantages in the marketplace 
government regulation substantially all of our operations are  or may become  subject to various federal laws and agency regulations 
these include the food  drug and cosmetic act  which is administered by the food and drug administration the fda 
the fda regulates the manufacturing  labeling and sale of our over the counter drug and cosmetic products 
the insecticide  fungicide and rodenticide act and the toxic substances control act are administered by the environmental protection agency and regulate our disinfectant products and certain substances used in the manufacturing of our products 
the meat inspection act is administered by the department of agriculture and regulates our meat products 
the hazardous substances act is administered by the consumer product safety commission and regulates the labeling of our household products 
the fair packaging and labeling act is administered by the federal trade commission the ftc and regulates the packaging and labeling of all of our products 
our products also are subject to regulation by various state laws and various state regulatory agencies 
in addition  we are subject to similar laws and regulations imposed by foreign jurisdictions 
since the s  the fda has regulated antibacterial soaps and hand washes under a proposed regulation 
although the proposed regulation has not been finalized  the fda ultimately could set standards that result in limiting or even precluding soap manufacturers from using some current antibacterial ingredients or making antibacterial claims for some product forms  such as bar soap 
dial  which uses the antibacterial ingredient triclosan in liquid dial and triclocarban in dial bar soap  emphasizes the antibacterial properties of its soap products in its marketing campaigns and product labeling 
any final fda regulation that limits or precludes this type of advertising could require us to develop new marketing campaigns  develop new products or utilize different antibacterial ingredients in its products  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
environmental matters we are subject to a variety of environmental and health and safety laws in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
these laws and regulations pertain to our present and past operations 
although we do not anticipate that the costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position  the emergence of unforeseen claims and liabilities or the imposition of increasingly stringent laws  regulations and enforcement policies could result in material  unreserved costs in the future 
since  we have received notices or requests for information with respect to superfund sites under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  three of which are currently active 
in addition  in and in prior years we used nonlyphenol ethoxylate as an ingredient in our liquid and powder detergents and we continue to use it as an ingredient in our zout stain remover products 
certain environmental and regulatory groups have raised concerns regarding toxicity of compounds produced from nonlyphenol ethoxylate 
we do not currently anticipate that we will incur significant capital expenditures in connection with matters relating to environmental control or compliance in we do not anticipate that the costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations or the costs related to superfund sites and the clean up of closed 
table of contents plant sites will have a material adverse effect on our financial results or condition 
we believe our reserves are adequate  but these costs are difficult to predict with certainty 
there can be no assurance that other developments  such as the emergence of unforeseen claims or liabilities or the imposition of increasingly stringent laws  regulations and enforcement policies  will not result in material costs in the future 
federal  state  local and foreign environmental compliance may from time to time require changes in product formulation or packaging 
these changes have not had  and are not expected to have  a material adverse effect on our financial results or condition 
employees we employed approximately  individuals  of whom approximately  were covered by collective bargaining agreements  as of december  three of our five plants in the united states are unionized 
in  we finalized negotiations of two labor contracts 
the first was with the international brotherhood of teamsters for the st

item legal proceedings as we have previously disclosed  we are defending a lawsuit filed by the us equal employment opportunity commission eeoc 
this lawsuit is pending in the us district court for the northern district of illinois  eastern division  and is entitled equal employment opportunity commission v 
the dial corporation  civil action no 
c the eeoc alleges that we engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination against a class of female employees at our aurora  illinois manufacturing facility by subjecting them to sexual harassment and failing to take prompt remedial action after these employees complained about the alleged harassment 
most of the potential claimants allegations relate to incidences that allegedly occurred prior to the eeoc is seeking injunctive relief and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages 
we have denied the eeoc s allegations 
there are currently potential claimants 
compensatory and punitive damages are limited to a maximum of  for each potential claimant 
however  we currently believe that the number of claimants who ultimately will be eligible to recover damages in this case is much fewer than based upon the potential claimants individualized allegations and our defenses 
nevertheless  no assurances can be given regarding the number of potential claimants who will ultimately be eligible to recover monetary damages 

table of contents the trial is scheduled to begin in late april during initial settlement discussions  the eeoc indicated that it is seeking million to resolve this case 
based upon our investigation  we do not believe the facts warrant such a large settlement 
accordingly  we are preparing for trial 
depending on the outcome  this case could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the period in which the case is resolved 
in addition  negative publicity resulting from this lawsuit could adversely affect our sales and operating results 
as is the case with many companies  we also face exposure to actual or potential claims and lawsuits involving our business and assets 
we are currently party to a number of lawsuits consisting of ordinary  routine litigation incidental to our business  including general and product liability and workers compensation claims 
we believe that any liabilities resulting from these claims  after taking into account amounts already accrued and including any potential insurance recovery  should not have a material adverse effect on our financial position  cash flows or operating results

item management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition potential sale of dial and future capital allocation strategy we believe that our long term interests and those of our shareholders would be best served if we were part of a larger enterprise 
we will continue to explore opportunities to become part of a larger company  which could include transactions with multiple parties 
we have been working with goldman sachs co 
and may continue to do so as we evaluate any opportunities for us to be part of a larger company 
no time constraints have been set for any transaction  and any decision regarding any potential transactions will be based upon the best interests of our shareholders 
accordingly  there is no assurance that any sale  merger or other transactions involving us or any of our businesses will occur in the near future or at all 
in addition  decisions made in the course of continuing to improve our operating results could require additional special or restructuring charges or additional asset writedowns 
we will continue to focus on growing our core businesses and will evaluate capital allocation options in light of the amount of cash we are accumulating 
the capital allocation alternatives we are reviewing include acquisitions share repurchases dividend increases debt reduction investment in our base business if suitable acquisition options do not emerge  then we currently expect to use cash to repurchase shares 
we also may consider increasing our dividend or reducing our debt 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of results of operations and financial condition are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we routinely evaluate our estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  income taxes  pension and other post retirement benefits  long lived assets  inventories  restructurings  self insurance primarily workers compensation  environmental matters  exit cost reserves related to discontinued operations and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
accounting policies are considered critical when they are both significant to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and they require difficult  subjective  or complex judgments or estimates 
we consider our critical accounting policies to include our calculation and treatment of the following expenses sales incentives income taxes pension and post retirement benefits management has discussed these critical accounting estimates with the audit committee of our board of directors 

table of contents sales incentives customer sales are recorded net of allowances for cash discounts  estimated sales returns  trade promotions and other sales incentives 
we routinely commit to both one time and on going trade promotion programs with customers that require us to estimate and accrue the ultimate costs of such programs 
we record an accrual for the earned  but unpaid costs related to our trade promotion programs 
trade promotion and cash discount costs are recorded as a deduction from sales 
estimating the costs associated with on going and routine trade promotion programs and cash discount expense for core brands is based on our experience and available historical information 
in determining liabilities for trade promotional spending  we must rely on judgment and estimates which include  but are not limited to  our understanding of trade promotional spending patterns  knowledge of the status of trade promotional activities  and the interpretation of historical spending trends by customer and category 
if our estimates were to differ by  the impact to promotional spending accruals would be approximately million 
income taxes under financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  income taxes are recorded based on current year amounts payable or refundable  as well as the consequences of events that give rise to deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we base our estimate of current and deferred taxes on the tax laws and rates that are currently in effect in the appropriate jurisdiction 
changes in tax laws or rates may affect the current amounts payable or refundable as well as the amount of deferred tax assets or liabilities 
we currently have million of net deferred tax assets resulting primarily from differences between book and tax treatment for certain items 
we believe that these net deferred tax assets will be realized based primarily on our projected future earnings and scheduling of our deferred tax liabilities 
however  the amount of the deferred tax assets actually realized could differ if we have little or no future earnings 
at december   we established a full valuation allowance of million for deferred tax assets related to a million capital loss from the sale of the specialty personal care business 
the million capital loss can only be utilized to offset net capital gains  and will expire on december  sfas no 
requires that a valuation allowance be established when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
changes in valuation allowances from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change 
in determining whether a valuation allowance is required  we take into account all evidence with regard to the utilization of a deferred tax asset including our past earnings history  expected future earnings  the character and jurisdiction of such earnings  unsettled circumstances that  if unfavorably resolved  would adversely affect utilization of a deferred tax asset  carryback and carryforward periods  and tax strategies that could potentially enhance the likelihood of realization of a deferred tax asset 
we will maintain a full valuation allowance for that capital loss until it is more likely than not to be utilized 
us income tax is not provided when foreign earnings are indefinitely reinvested in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for income taxes  special areas 
we determine whether our foreign subsidiaries have invested or will invest a significant portion of their undistributed earnings indefinitely 
we reassess our determination on a periodic basis 
changes to our determination may be warranted based on the experience as well as plans regarding future international operations and expected tax payments 
changes in the determination from period to period are included in our tax provision in the period of change 
as of december   we had not provided for any us taxes on approximately million of undistributed earnings from our non us subsidiaries since these earnings are indefinitely reinvested 
pension and post retirement benefits our employee pension and other post retirement benefits ie  health care and life insurance costs and obligations are accounted for under the provisions of sfas no 
 employer s accounting for pensions 
table of contents and sfas no 
 employer s accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the calculation and measurement of these expenses and liabilities are based on a variety of assumptions  including discount rates  medical trend rates  expected long term rate of return on plan assets  salary growth rates  employee turnover  retirement and mortality rates 
the assumptions are based on our historical experience as well as current facts and known economic and market conditions 
we use third party actuaries to assist in properly measuring the expense and obligations related to these employee benefits 
while we believe that the assumptions used are appropriate  the use of different estimates could result in variances in the amount of expense recognized 
the table below illustrates the approximate impact to expense if we were to change the following key assumptions by rate impact of key assumptions used rate change in millions rate of return on assets discount rate salary growth rate initial medical trend rate the key rates were used to measure the pension and post retirement benefit expense in the related accounting requirements allow for the amortization of gains and losses over future periods  which result from differences between our assumptions and actual results 
therefore  such gains and losses impact our recognized expense and related obligations in future periods 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we use a five year amortization of pension asset gains and losses ie  calculated value when calculating the expected return on assets component of net periodic pension cost 
variances that may result from using this calculated value as opposed to the straight fair market value of assets are expected to net to zero over time 
the significant declines in the financial markets over the past two years coupled with the decline in interest rates have caused our accumulated pension obligation to exceed the fair value of the related plan assets 
as a result  in we recorded an increase to our accrued pension liability of approximately million and a non cash charge to equity of approximately million after tax 
this charge may be reversed in future periods if market conditions improve or interest rates rise 
see note to the consolidated financial statements included in the form k for more information regarding the costs and obligations for pensions and post retirement benefits

with the possible exception of acquisitions  we believe that we will have sufficient resources to execute this strategy without increasing debt 
net cash provided by operations in was million versus million in and million in the increase in net cash provided by operations in was primarily due to an increase in net income and favorable tax benefits from the sale of our specialty personal care business in and the pending sale of our argentina business in partially offsetting these benefits were higher receivables and inventory levels in support of higher sales

under the prospective method  expense is recognized for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied 
the modified prospective method recognizes stock based employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the provisions are first applied  as if the fair value method had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  under the retroactive restatement method  all periods presented are restated to reflect stock based employee compensation cost under the fair value method for all employee awards granted  modified  or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results using a prescribed specific tabular format and requiring disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies or its equivalent 
we have adopted the new disclosure requirements for  and are currently evaluating the impact if we were to adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under all three methods

inherent in this process are a number of factors that we must successfully manage to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect our future operating results and financial condition include  but are not limited to  the factors discussed below 
we are considering selling substantial assets or the entire company 
there can be no assurance that we will sell substantial assets or the entire company in the near future or at all 
the uncertainty caused by our consideration of these alternatives could harm employee recruiting and retention and impair our relationships with our customers  suppliers and lenders 
we are considering selling substantial assets or the entire company 
in this regard  we believe that we may be best served by becoming a part of a larger enterprise 
we cannot assure that any transactions will occur or  if transactions do occur  that they will improve our operating results or financial condition or be on terms favorable to us 
moreover  the uncertainty created by this environment may adversely impact our ability to retain employees and our relationships with customers  suppliers and lenders 
we have developed and commenced sales of a number of new products  which  if they do not gain widespread customer acceptance or if they cannibalize sales of existing products  could harm our efforts to improve our financial performance 
we have introduced a number of new products in the soap  detergent and air freshener categories 
in addition  we have committed to increase development efforts in our core brands 
the development and introduction of new products involve substantial research  development and marketing expenditures  which we may be unable to recoup if our new products do not gain widespread market acceptance or we do not execute product roll outs effectively 
in addition  if our new products merely cannibalize sales of our existing products  our financial performance would be harmed 

table of contents we may discontinue products or product lines  which could result in returns  asset write offs and shut down costs 
in the past  we have discontinued certain products and product lines  which resulted in returns from customers  asset write offs  and shut down costs 
we may suffer similar results in the future to the extent we discontinue products that do not meet expectations or no longer satisfy consumer demand 
product returns  write offs or shut down costs would reduce our cash flow and earnings 
we face intense competition in a mature industry that may require us to increase expenditures and lower profit margins to preserve or maintain our market share 
unless the markets in which we compete grow substantially  a loss of market share will result in reduced sales levels and less favorable operating results 
currently  of our sales are generated in us markets 
us markets for consumer products are mature and characterized by high household penetration  particularly with respect to our most significant product categories  including detergents and bar soaps 
we may not be able to succeed in implementing our strategies to increase domestic revenues 
our unit sales growth in domestic markets will depend on increasing usage by consumers  product innovation and capturing market share from competitors 
the consumer products industry is intensely competitive 
to protect our existing market share or to capture increased market share  we may need to increase expenditures for promotions and advertising and to introduce and establish new products 
increased expenditures may not prove successful in maintaining or enhancing our market share and could result in lower sales and profits 
many of our competitors are large companies  including the procter gamble company  lever brothers co  colgate palmolive company  and sc johnson son  inc  which have greater financial resources than we do 
they have the capacity to outspend us in an attempt to take market share from us 
price cutting measures in response to competitive pressures could result in decreased profit margins 
consumer products  particularly those that are value priced  are subject to significant price competition 
from time to time  we may need to reduce the prices for some of our products to respond to competitive and customer pressures and to maintain market share 
any reduction in our prices to respond to these pressures would harm our profit margins 
in addition  if our sales volumes fail to grow sufficiently to offset any reduction in margins  our results of operations would suffer 
providing price concessions or trade terms that are acceptable to our trade customers  or our failure to do so  could adversely affect our sales and profitability 
in addition  reductions in inventory by our trade customers  including as a result of consolidations in the retail industry  could adversely affect our sales 
because of the competitive environment facing retailers  we face pricing pressure from these customers 
many of our trade customers  particularly our high volume retail store customers  have increasingly sought to obtain pricing concessions or better trade terms 
these concessions or terms could reduce our margins 
further  if we are unable to maintain price or trade terms that are acceptable to our trade customers  they could increase product purchases from our competitors  which would harm our sales and profitability 
in addition  from time to time our retail customers have reduced inventory levels in managing their working capital requirements 
any reduction in inventory levels by our retail customers would harm our operating results 
in particular  consolidation within the retail industry could potentially reduce inventory levels maintained by our retail customers  which could adversely impact our results of operations 
our performance is also dependent upon the general health of the economy and of the retail environment in particular and could be significantly harmed by changes affecting retailing and by the financial difficulties of retailers  including the ongoing bankruptcy proceedings involving kmart 
loss of our principal customers could significantly decrease our sales and profitability 
our top ten customers accounted for  and of net sales in  and  respectively 
wal mart  including its affiliate sam s club  was our largest customer  accounting for of net sales in  of net sales in  and of net sales in the loss of or a substantial decrease in the 
table of contents volume of purchases by wal mart or any of our other top customers including kmart  which has filed for bankruptcy protection could harm our sales and profitability 
price increases in certain raw materials or energy costs could erode our profit margins  which would harm our operating results 
increases in the prices of certain raw materials or increases in energy costs could significantly impact our profit margins 
paper  fats and oils  detergent chemicals  resin and meat have the most significant impact on our costs 
tallow a key ingredient in dial bar soaps has experienced price fluctuations within the range of and per pound from january   to december  recently  the price of tallow has been trading around the mid point of this historical range 
if prices were to increase  we may not be able to increase the prices of our dial bar soaps to offset these increases 
moreover  in light of recent world events  energy costs are increasing and these increases could adversely impact our profit margins and operating results in we rely on single sources for some of our products and if our suppliers were unable to produce products for us for an extended period of time it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we rely on single sources for some of our products 
for example  we currently rely on a single company owned plant to manufacture our dial bar soap  a single contract manufacturer for our renuzit adjustables products and a single supplier for purex liquid laundry detergent bottles 
if any of our single sources were unable to produce products for us for an extended period of time  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and operating results 
we may make acquisitions that prove unsuccessful or strain or divert our resources 
we have stated that acquisitions are our first priority within the next year with respect to our capital allocation options 
any future acquisitions or investments would entail various risks  including the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the acquired businesses or products  the potential disruption of our ongoing business and  generally  our potential inability to obtain the desired financial and strategic benefits from the acquisition or investment 
these factors could harm our financial results 
any future acquisitions or investments could result in substantial cash expenditures and the incurrence of additional debt and contingent liabilities 
in addition  any potential acquisitions or investments  whether or not they are ultimately completed  could divert the attention of our management and our other resources from other issues that are critical to our operations 
the fda could impose standards that negatively impact our ability to market some of our products as antibacterial  which could result in compliance costs and could make our products less attractive to our customers 
since the s  the food and drug administration has regulated antibacterial soaps and hand washes under a proposed regulation 
although the proposed regulation has not been finalized  the fda ultimately could set standards that result in limiting or even precluding soap manufacturers from using some current antibacterial ingredients or making antibacterial claims for some product forms  such as bar soap 
we use the antibacterial ingredient triclosan in liquid dial and triclocarban in dial bar soap  and emphasize the antibacterial properties of our soap products in our marketing campaigns and product labeling 
any final fda regulation that limits or precludes this type of advertising could require us to develop new marketing campaigns  develop new products or utilize different antibacterial ingredients in our products  all of which could make our products less attractive to customers and could seriously harm our business 
we could become the subject of adverse publicity or product recalls that negatively impact our operations 
adverse publicity regarding our products could impact the sales of our products 
some news broadcasts by major us television and radio networks have focused on the use of antibacterial agents to kill germs on various surfaces 
triclosan  the active ingredient in liquid dial  also has been a focus of these broadcasts 
although the broadcasts do not dispute that triclosan kills germs on the skin  some third party experts 
table of contents question whether it provides any additional protection beyond that provided by non antibacterial soap products 
although we have test results that we believe prove that triclosan provides consumers with additional protection in limiting exposure to bacteria related diseases  we cannot assure you that our triclosan products or other products will not be the subject of adverse publicity in the future 
from time to time  consumer product companies  including dial  have had to recall products for various reasons 
the costs of recall or other related liabilities could materially lower our profit margins 
adverse publicity regarding any product recalls also could depress our sales 
in addition  we share the use of the armour trademark for food products with conagra inc  the manufacturer of armour branded non canned meat products 
accordingly  we face the added risk that consumer preferences and perceptions with respect to any of our armour products may be influenced by adverse publicity affecting any of the armour branded products of conagra  inc we are defending a lawsuit brought by the us equal employment opportunity commission eeoc and a settlement or adverse verdict could harm our operating results in the period in which the case is resolved 
negative publicity concerning this case also could harm our sales and operating results 
as previously disclosed  we are defending a lawsuit filed by the eeoc  which is pending in the us district court for the northern district of illinois  eastern division civil action no 
c 
the eeoc alleges that we engaged in a pattern and practice of discrimination against a class of female employees at our aurora  illinois manufacturing facility by subjecting them to sexual harassment and failing to take prompt remedial action after these employees communicated the alleged harassment 
most of the potential claimants allegations relate to incidences that allegedly occurred prior to the eeoc is seeking injunctive relief and unspecified compensatory and punitive damages 
we have denied the eeoc s allegations 
there are currently potential claimants 
compensatory and punitive damages are limited to a maximum of  for each potential claimant 
however  we currently believe that the number of claimants who ultimately will be eligible to recover damages in this case is much fewer than based upon the potential claimants individualized allegations and our defenses 
nevertheless  no assurances can be given regarding the number of potential claimants who will ultimately be eligible to recover monetary damages 
during initial settlement discussions  the eeoc indicated that it is seeking million to resolve this case 
based upon our investigation  we do not believe the facts warrant such a large settlement 
accordingly  we are preparing for trial 
the trial is scheduled to begin in late april depending on the outcome  this case could have a material adverse effect on our operating results in the quarter in which the case is resolved 
in addition  negative publicity resulting from this lawsuit could harm our sales and operating results 
we have announced the pending sale of our argentina business  but if this transaction does not close  we will continue to be exposed to risks associated with operating in argentina 
as previously disclosed  we have reached an agreement to sell our argentina business to an entity designated by southern cross group  a private equity investor in argentina 
the sale is subject to satisfaction of negotiated closing conditions and receipt of approvals under argentina s antitrust and bulk transfer laws 
the sale currently is expected to close late in the second quarter of if the transaction does not close  we will continue to be exposed to the risks of operating in argentina  including poor economic conditions  currency fluctuations and unstable governments and legal systems 
the additional risks and expenses inherent in operating in argentina could harm our profit  cash flows and stockholders equity 
we may incur unexpected expenses due to environmental  health or safety matters 
we are subject to a variety of environmental and health and safety laws in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
these laws and regulations pertain to our present and past operations 
although we currently do not anticipate that the costs to comply with environmental laws and regulations will have a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings or competitive position  the emergence of unforeseen claims or liabilities or the imposition of increasingly stringent laws  regulations and enforcement policies could result in material  
table of contents unreserved costs in the future 
since  we have received notices or requests for information with respect to superfund sites under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act  three of which are currently active 
in addition  in and in prior years we used nonlyphenol ethoxylate as an ingredient in our liquid and powder detergent products and we continue to use it as an ingredient in our zout stain remover products 
certain environmental and regulatory groups have raised concerns regarding the toxicity of compounds produced from nonlyphenol ethoxylate 
we believe our reserves are adequate  but these costs are difficult to predict with certainty 
loss of key managerial personnel could negatively impact our operations 
our operation requires managerial expertise 
of our current key personnel  only our chief executive officer has an employment contract with us 
we cannot assure you that any of our key employees will remain employed by us 
if we lose any of our key personnel  our business could suffer 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discussion of our exposure to various market risks contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
these projected results have been prepared utilizing assumptions considered reasonable in light of information currently available to us 
nevertheless  because of the unpredictability of interest rates  foreign currency rates  commodity prices and other factors  actual results could differ materially from those projected in this forward looking information 
our use of financial instruments is limited to purposes other than trading and primarily includes management of interest rate and commodity expense 
we may use financial instruments for the management of interest rates  foreign currency or other risks in the future 
interest rate risk at december   we had million in long term debt outstanding  comprised of million million net of issue discount of senior notes due  and million million net of issue discount of bonds due our senior notes have fixed interest rates to maturity 
at the time of the issuance of the million senior notes due  we entered into two interest rate swaps  which together were designated as fair market value hedges of that issue 
the interest rate swaps had a total notional amount of million 
in august of  the interest rate swaps were terminated and we received a payment of million 
the gain on the termination of the swaps was deferred and is classified as a part of long term debt 
the deferred gain will be amortized over the remaining term of the million senior notes as a reduction of interest expense 
the amortization of the gain on the terminated swaps effectively reduces the fixed rate of the million senior notes to approximately annually 
we are currently investing our accumulated cash balance in a variety of short term investment vehicles with low principal risk 
the weighted average yield on the invested cash at december  was 
each basis point change in the yield on the invested cash would result in an approximate million change in our other expense  net 
in january  we entered into two interest rate swaps contracts that effectively changes the interest rate on a portion of our senior notes from fixed to variable 
the total notional value of the interest rate swaps that expire in september is million  effectively converting of our total debt to variable interest rates 
under the terms of the swaps  we pay a variable rate of interest based on a month libor plus basis points and receive a fixed interest of 
variable interest rates are paid and reset semi annually 
the applicable libor rate resets every six months 
the six month libor rate on january  was 
the swaps expose us to the risk of changes in libor based interest rates 
each basis point change in the swaps floating rate would change our pre tax interest expense by million 

table of contents foreign currency we are exposed to risks from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  primarily us dollar canadian dollar and us dollar argentine peso 
historically  the argentine peso s value was pegged by the argentine government as equal to the us dollar 
however  in late december  the argentine government declared strict limitations on bank withdrawals  effectively blocking all convertibility of argentine pesos to us dollars at december  on february   the argentine government abandoned the dual exchange rate and allowed the argentine peso to float freely against other currencies 
during  the us dollar argentine peso exchange rate fluctuated between and if there were a change in the exchange rates for the us dollar to the argentine peso from those at december  until the expected sale date  the gain or loss would be immaterial 
at december   one us dollar was worth canadian dollars 
for the year ended december   the us dollar canadian dollar exchange rate fluctuated between and if there were a change in the exchange rates for the us dollar to the canadian dollar from those at december   the foreign currency gain or loss would be immaterial 
employee benefit plan expense we offer our directors and management deferred compensation plans 
under these plans  participants can defer a portion of their compensation into a combination of dial stock units or various cash accounts 
for deferrals made into stock units  deferred compensation due to participants is included on the balance sheet in stockholders equity under the caption employee benefits with no recognition of any investment gains or losses 
the deferred funds are placed in a rabbi trust using shares of dial common stock 
the trust is also included on the balance sheet in stockholders equity under the caption employee benefits 
for deferrals into cash accounts  deferred compensation due to participants and any accumulated investment gains or losses is included on the balance sheet as a liability under the captions pension and other benefits and other liabilities 
we place the deferred funds in a rabbi trust  which purchases life insurance policies on the participants lives  with dial as the beneficiary 
the policies have cash surrender value that accrues tax free earnings largely based on the performance of the s p the cash surrender value asset and any accumulated investment gains or losses are included on the balance sheet as an asset under the caption other assets
