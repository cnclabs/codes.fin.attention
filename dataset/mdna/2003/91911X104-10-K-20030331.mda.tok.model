restructuring during  the company conducted a strategic review of its operations 
as a result of that review  the company now intends to emphasize its specialty pharmaceuticals business  to divest itself of those businesses that do not fit the company s strategic growth plans and to exert efforts to bring its overall cost structure in line with industry averages 
key elements of the strategic repositioning include the following refocusing the company s specialty pharmaceuticals business in north america  latin america  and western and central europe  particularly germany  italy and poland  with greater attention on selected therapeutic areas 
bolstering the company s product development capabilities across the organization to broaden and develop the pipeline and extend existing product life cycles 
divesting non core businesses that do not fit the company s strategic growth plans 
lowering costs  primarily in the company s corporate headquarters and european headquarters  which were subsequently closed 
pursuing opportunities to rationalize the manufacturing network and improve product and supply chain operations 
as a result of this strategic review  the company made the decision to divest its russian pharmaceuticals segment  biomedicals segment  photonics business  raw materials business and manufacturing capability in hungary and the czech republic and circe unit 
the results of these operations and the related financial position have been reflected as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the consolidated financial statements have been restated to conform to the discontinued operations presentation for all historical periods presented 
at the time of the ribapharm offering  the company stated that it intended to pursue a tax free distribution of its remaining interest in ribapharm to the company s stockholders a spin off  although there was no obligation to do so 
following the company s annual meeting of stockholders  which led to significant changes in composition of the board of directors and leadership of the company  the company announced that it was re evaluating its past restructuring plans  including whether to pursue a potential spin off 
the company is currently evaluating its options with respect to ribapharm 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon its consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these statements requires the company s management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to product returns  collectibility of receivables  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
the company s actual results could differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company recognizes revenue from product sales when the goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfer to the customer 
allowances for returns are provided for based upon an analysis of the company s historical patterns of returns matched against the sales from which they originated 
the sales return is recorded as a reduction of product sales 
the company earns royalty revenue at the time the products subject to the royalty are sold by a third party 
accordingly the company accrues for earned royalty net of estimated returns and discounts 
royalty payments received from schering plough ltd 
schering are reduced by schering s cash payments for discounts  rebates and similar deductions 
the company evaluates the collectibility of its receivables at least quarterly 
the company s methodology for establishing the allowance for bad debts varies with the regions in which it operates 
the allowance for bad debts is based upon specific identification of customer accounts and the company s best estimate of the likelihood of potential loss  taking into account such factors as the financial condition and payment history of major customers 
the company also evaluates the carrying value of its inventories at least quarterly  taking into account such factors as historical and anticipated future sales compared with quantities on hand  the price the company expects to obtain for its products in their respective markets compared with historical cost and the remaining shelf life of goods on hand 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers future taxable income and other expected future amounts in determining the amount of valuation allowance necessary 
in the event the company determines that actual taxable income will be less than expected or other future events will not occur  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of intangibles including the related amortization periods 
in evaluating acquired product rights and other intangible assets  the company determines whether there has been impairment by comparing the anticipated undiscounted future operating income of the product line with its carrying value 
if the undiscounted operating income is less than the carrying value  the amount of the impairment  if any  will be determined by comparing the carrying value of each intangible asset with its fair value 
fair value is generally based on a discounted cash flows analysis 
the company evaluated the businesses included in discontinued operations by comparing the carrying value of the long lived assets to their fair value  as determined using discounted cash flows analysis  appraisals and purchase offers 
results of operations certain financial information for the company s business segments is set forth below 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company included elsewhere in this document

revenue in thousands pharmaceuticals north america latin america western europe asia  africa  australia total pharmaceuticals ribapharm royalty revenues total revenues cost of product sales gross profit margin on product sales year ended december  compared to ribapharm royalty revenues royalty revenues represent amounts earned by the company s ribapharm subsidiary under the license and supply agreement the license agreement with schering 
under the license agreement  schering licensed all oral forms of ribavirin for the treatment of chronic hepatitis c hcv in combination with schering s alpha interferon the combination therapy 
schering has informed the company and ribapharm that it believes royalties paid under the license agreement should not include royalties on products distributed as part of its indigent patient marketing program 
schering claims that because it receives no revenue from products given to indigent patients  it should not have to pay royalties on these products under the license agreement 
in august  schering withheld approximately  from its royalty payment relating to the second quarter of the amount withheld was purportedly intended by schering to be a retroactive adjustment of royalties previously paid to the company and ribapharm through the third quarter of on products distributed as part of this indigent patient marketing program 
since the fourth quarter of  schering has withheld on a current basis all royalty payments purportedly related to this indigent patient marketing program 
the company and ribapharm recognized the  of withheld royalty payments for the retroactive adjustment and  of royalty payments withheld for the fourth quarter of and the first quarter of as income 
the company and ribapharm have not established a reserve for these amounts  because  in the opinion of management  collectibility is reasonably assured based upon ribapharm management s interpretation of the license agreement and its understanding of the circumstances 
since the second quarter of  the company and ribapharm no longer recognize any of these withheld royalty payments as income  as such amounts can no longer be determined due to a lack of information provided by schering 
the company and ribapharm have commenced arbitration with schering to collect these royalties and prevent schering from withholding royalty payments on sales under the indigent patient marketing program in the future 
the parties selected an arbitrator  discovery has commenced and arbitration hearings are currently expected to begin in may or june if the company and ribapharm do not succeed in this arbitration  ribapharm may have to write off all or a portion of this receivable 
if the company and ribapharm do succeed  ribapharm will be entitled to receive the royalty payments on these indigent sales withheld by schering 
schering recently entered into license agreements with three generic pharmaceutical companies  which granted to the three companies non exclusive  non sublicensable licenses to schering s us ribavirin patents 
the outcome of the dispute regarding royalties from the indigent marketing program and schering s licenses to the three generic pharmaceutical companies could have a material negative impact on ribapharm s future royalty revenues 
in april  schering asserted a counterclaim against the company and ribapharm in this arbitration based on the company s alleged failure to assist schering in securing certain distribution rights in egypt 
the company and ribapharm intend to vigorously contest this counterclaim 
schering announced that it was served with two grand jury subpoenas by the united states attorney for the district of massachusetts which has been investigating certain of schering s sales and marketing practices 
among other information  the subpoenas seek a broad range of information concerning schering s sales  marketing and clinical trial practices and programs with respect to rebetron  its sales and marketing contacts with managed care organizations and doctors and its offering or provision of grants  honorariums or other items or services of value to managed care organizations  physician groups  doctors and educational institutions 
according to schering  it is not possible to predict the outcome of the investigation  which could include the commencement of civil or criminal proceedings involving the imposition of fines  penalties and injunctive or administrative remedies  including exclusion from government reimbursement programs  nor whether the investigation will affect schering s marketing  sales or clinical trial practices 
the company  which is not a party to  or otherwise involved in this investigation of schering  cannot predict the impact  if any  of this investigation on royalty revenues under the license agreement with schering

roche is responsible for all future development costs of levovirin 
it is not unusual for the clinical development of these types of products to take five years or more and to cost over  the time and cost of completing the clinical development of these product candidates will depend on a number of factors  including the disease or medical condition to be treated  clinical trial design  availability of patients to participate in trials and the relative efficacy of the product versus treatments already approved and whether or when the company or ribapharm license the product candidates to third parties 
due to these many uncertainties  the company and ribapharm are unable to estimate the length of time or the costs that will be required to complete the development of these product candidates

changes in the relative values of currencies occur from time to time have and may  in certain instances  materially affect the company s results of operations

the company does not currently provide any hedges on its foreign currency exposure and  in certain countries in which the company operates  no effective hedging programs are available 
russia while the russian economy continues to show improvement since the financial crisis that began in  the economy continues to experience difficulties 
in  the ruble fell sharply from a rate of rubles to to a rate of rubles to at december  throughout  and  the ruble continued to fluctuate  there is continued volatility in the debt and equity market  hyperinflation persists  confidence in the banking sector has yet to be restored and there continues to be general lack of liquidity in the economy 
in addition  laws and regulations affecting businesses operating within russia continue to evolve 
russia s return to economic stability is dependent to a large extent on the effectiveness of the measures taken by the government  decisions of international lending organizations  and other actions  including regulatory and political developments  which are beyond the company s control 
at december   the ruble exchange rate was rubles to as compared with the rate of rubles to and rubles to as of december  and  respectively 
as a result of the change in the ruble exchange rate  the company recorded translation losses of   and  included in loss on discounted operations related to its russian operations during  and  respectively 
as of december   icn russia had a net monetary asset position of approximately  which is subject to foreign exchange loss as further declines in the value of the ruble in relation to the dollar occur 
due to the fluctuation in the ruble exchange rate  the ultimate amount of any future translation and exchange loss the company may incur cannot presently be determined and such loss may have a negative impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s management continues to work to manage its net monetary exposure 
however  there can be no assurance that such efforts will be successful

subsequently  the company has taken additional steps to ensure the creditworthiness of its customers and the collectibility of accounts receivable by tightening its credit policies in the region 
these steps include a shortening of credit periods  suspension of sales to customers with past due balances and discounts for cash sales 
yugoslavia on february   the government of the federal republic of yugoslavia  acting through the federal ministry of health and or the ministry of health of serbia  seized control of the company s owned subsidiary  icn yugoslavia

acquired products the majority of products acquired by the company are mature products with no effective patents  either because of expirations or the absence of legal protections provided by the local governments in the respective markets 
under the company s ownership  price increases and additional advertising and promotions were planned for selected products  as the company believes they were not marketed to their greatest potential 
the company believes some of these products in specific markets have an adequate growth potential  and intends to develop a product strategy for such products 
the company believes these products will continue to generate significant sales even without patent protection because the trademarks under which they are marketed are well established and enjoy substantial customer brand loyalty 
moreover  the relatively small sales volumes and market sizes for some of these products pose significant barriers to entry of generic competition 
the company estimated the remaining life of these products based on anticipated future profits assuming a constant profit margin for the remaining product cycle 
it should be noted  however  any sales growth or increase in profitability attained by additional marketing efforts is expected to be relatively short lived 
after a temporary boost  these products will revert to their gradually declining trend in accordance with the product cycle model 
the acquired products historical operating results demonstrated their ability to earn substantial excess profits 
excess profits are directly related to their competitive advantage primarily attributable to the product quality and reputation 
the useful life was defined as the number of years for the forecasted annual product sales to reach of the cumulative historical amount through the date of acquisition
