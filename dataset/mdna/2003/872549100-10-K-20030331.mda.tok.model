effective june   the company changed its fiscal year end from may to december in accordance with an agreement and plan of merger with laservision  the company completed a business combination with laservision on may   which resulted in laservision becoming a wholly owned subsidiary of tlc vision 
accordingly  laservision s results are included in the company s statement of operations beginning on the date of acquisition 
laservision is a leading access service provider of excimer lasers  microkeratomes and other equipment and value and support services to eye surgeons 
the company believes that the combined companies can provide a broader array of services to eye care professionals to ensure these individuals may provide superior quality of care and achieve outstanding clinical results 
the company believes this will be the long term determinant of success in the eye surgery services industry 
the company serves surgeons who performed over  refractive and cataract procedures at the company s centers or using the company s laser access services during the seven months ended december  the company is assessing patient  optometric and ophthalmic industry trends and developing strategies to improve laser vision correction procedure volumes and increased revenues 
cost reduction initiatives continue to target the effective use of funds and our growth initiative is focusing on future development opportunities for the company in the eye care industry 
the company recognizes revenues at the time procedures are performed or services are rendered 
revenues include amounts charged patients for procedures performed at owned laser centers  amounts charged physicians for laser access and service fees  and management fees from managing refractive and secondary care practices 
under the terms of management service agreements  the company provides non clinical services  which include facilities  staffing  equipment lease and maintenance  marketing and administrative services to refractive and secondary care practices in return for management fees 
the management fees are typically addressed as a per procedure fee 
for third party payor programs and corporations with arrangements with tlc vision  the company s management fee and the fee charged by the surgeon are both discounted in proportion to the discount afforded to these organizations 
while the company does not direct the manner in which the surgeons practice medicine  the company does direct the day to day non clinical operations of the centers 
the management service agreements typically are for an extended period of time  ranging from five to years 
management fees are equal to the net revenue of the physician practice  less amounts retained by the physician groups 
procedure volumes represent the number of laser vision correction procedures completed for which the amount that the patient has been invoiced for the procedure exceeds a predefined company wide per procedure revenue threshold 
procedures may be invoiced less than the threshold amounts primarily for promotional or marketing purposes and are not included in the procedure volume numbers reported 
doctors compensation as presented in the financial statements represents the cost to the company of engaging ophthalmic professionals to perform laser vision correction services at the company s owned laser centers and fees paid to optometrists for pre and post operative care 
where the company manages laser centers  the professional corporations or physicians performing the professional services at such centers engage ophthalmic professionals 
as such  the costs associated with arranging for these professionals to furnish professional services are reported as a cost of the professional corporation and not of the company 
included in costs of revenue are the laser fees payable to laser manufacturers for royalties  use and maintenance of the lasers  variable expenses for consumables  and facility fees  as well as center costs associated with personnel  facilities and depreciation of center assets 
in company owned centers  the company engages doctors to provide laser vision correction services and the amounts paid to the doctors also are reported as a cost of revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses include expenses that are not directly related to the provision of laser correction services or cataract services 
in the transitional period ended december   the company s procedure volume increased by  compared to the corresponding period of the seven month contribution of laservision accounted for an increase of  while the tlc vision procedures decreased by  to  the company believes that the reduction in procedure volume is indicative of overall conditions in the laser vision correction industry 
the laser vision correction industry has experienced uncertainty resulting from a number of issues 
being an elective procedure  laser vision correction volumes have been depressed by economic and stock market conditions  rising employment and the uncertainty associated with the war on terrorism currently being experienced in north america which is reflected in a weakening of the consumer confidence index 
also contributing to the decline in procedure volume is a wide range of consumer prices for laser vision correction procedures  the bankruptcies of a number of deep discount laser vision correction companies  the ongoing safety and effectiveness concerns arising from the lack of long term follow up data and negative news stories focusing on patients with unfavorable outcomes from procedures performed at centers competing with the company

critical accounting policies impairment of goodwill the company accounts for its goodwill in accordance with sfas  which requires the company to test goodwill for impairment annually and whenever events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the reporting unit below its carrying value 
sfas no 
requires the company to determine the fair value of its reporting units 
because quoted market prices do not exist for the company s reporting units  the company uses the present value of expected future cash flows to estimate fair value 
management must make significant judgments and estimates about future conditions to estimate future cash flows 
unforeseen events and changes in circumstances and market conditions including general economic and competitive conditions  could result in significant changes in those estimates and material charges to income 
during the transitional period ended december  and the fiscal year ended may   the company determined that significant impairments in the value of the goodwill had occurred and recorded a charge to earnings in both periods 
impairment of long lived assets the company accounts for its long lived assets in accordance with sfas  which requires the company to assess the recoverability of these assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the long lived asset group might not be recoverable 
if impairment indicators exist  the company determines whether the projected undiscounted cash flows will be sufficient to cover the carrying value of such assets 
this requires the company to make significant judgements about the expected future cash flows of the asset group 
the future cash flows are dependent on general and economic conditions and are subject to change 
a change in these assumptions could result in material charges to income 
during the fiscal year ended may  the company determined that a significant impairment in the value of its intangible assets and certain of its fixed assets had occurred and recorded a charge to earnings 
investments periodically the company invests in marketable and non marketable equity securities 
the company accounts for its marketable equity available for sale securities in accordance with sfas  which requires the company to record these investments at market value as of the end of each reporting period 
changes in market value are recorded as other comprehensive income except when declines in market value below cost are considered to be other than temporary 
the company accounts for its non marketable equity securities under the cost method of accounting as the company does not exercise significant influence over the investees 
for these investments the company assesses the value of the investment by using information acquired from industry trends  the management of these companies  and other external sources as well as recent stock transactions 
based on the information acquired  an impairment charge is recorded when management believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
the determination of whether a decline in market value is considered other than temporary involves making significant judgments considering factors such as the length of duration of the decline and factors specific to each investment 
during the fiscal year ended may  and the transitional period ended december   the company determined an other than temporary decline had occurred in certain investments and recorded a significant charge to income

revenues from managed centers for the seven months ended december  were million  a decrease of million  or  from the revenues of million for the seven months ended december  as laservision does not have a managed service product  there was no contribution from laservision for the seven months ended december revenues from access services for the seven months ended december  were million 
because access revenues are a product offering of laservision only  the company did not report any associated access revenue in the seven months ended december  for the existing tlc vision business 
approximately  refractive procedures were performed for the seven months ended december   compared to approximately  procedures for the seven months ended december  laservision accounted for  procedures while the tlc vision procedures decreased by  to  the company believes that the reduction in procedure volume was indicative of overall conditions in the laser vision correction industry

also contributing to the decline was a wide range in consumer prices for laser vision correction procedures  the bankruptcies of a number of deep discount laser vision correction companies  the ongoing safety and effectiveness concerns arising from the lack of long term follow up data and negative news stories focusing on patients with unfavorable outcomes from procedures performed at centers competing with the company 
the cost of refractive revenues from eye care centers for the seven months ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  over the cost of refractive revenues of million for the seven months ended december  laservision cost of revenue for was million while the existing tlc vision s cost of revenue decreased by million  or 
the cost of revenues from owned centers for the seven months ended december  was million  an increase of million  or  from the cost of revenues of million from the seven months ended december  laservision cost of revenue for was million while the existing tlc vision cost of revenue decreased million  or 
the cost of revenues from managed centers for the seven months ended december  was million  a decrease of million  or  from the cost of revenues of million from the seven months ended december  as laservision does not have a managed service product  the company did not report any additional cost from laservision for the seven months ended december  the cost of revenues from access services for the seven months ended december  was million 
access services are a product offering of laservision only  therefore  there was no associated access cost of revenue in the seven months ended december  from the existing tlc vision business 
reductions in cost of revenue were consistent with reduced doctors compensation resulting from lower procedure volumes  reductions in royalty fees on laser usage and reduced personnel costs 
the cost of revenues for refractive centers include a fixed cost component for infrastructure of personnel  facilities and minimum equipment usage fees which has resulted in cost of revenues decreasing at a slower rate than the decrease in the associated revenues 
revenues from other healthcare services for the seven months ended december   were million  an increase of million from revenues of million for the seven months ended december  laservision accounted for million of the increase while the existing tlc vision revenue increased by million  or

amortization expenses decreased to million for the seven months ended december  from million for the seven months ended december  the decrease in amortization expense was largely a result of the significant impairment charge in may  which reduced the fair value of pma s and the related ongoing amortization 
research and development expenses reflected million invested in vascular sciences 
since the technology was in the development stage and was not available commercially and had not received food and drug administration approval  the company accounted for this investment as a research and development arrangement whereby investments were expensed as vascular sciences expends amounts 
if the product becomes commercially available  incremental investments may be recorded as long term assets 
the company determined its goodwill was impaired and recorded a charge of million during the transitional period 
this charge was comprised of million that relates to the goodwill attributable to reporting units acquired in the laservision acquisition and million relating to goodwill attributable to reporting units acquired in prior years 
in december  tlc vision wrote down its investment in a privately held company by million 
that company  which develops an implantable product that corrects and maintains vision is actively seeking additional funding at this time and has received a term sheet from a venture capital firm that indicates significant dilution to the existing shareholders 
tlc vision wrote down the investment to million to reflect the estimated market value of the investment

no restructuring charge has been made relating to this facility as no decision has been made with regard to the use or disposal of this facility and the company continues to use this facility for certain functions 
any costs associated with exiting or renegotiating the lease on this facility  which could be material  would be charged against income in future periods 
other income and expense for the seven months ended december  consisted of million of income from the settlement of an antitrust lawsuit 
in august  laservision received million from its portion of the settlement and tlc vision received million from its portion of the settlement 
the million relating to the activities of laservision represented a contingent asset acquired by the company and was included in the purchase price allocation at may  as an other asset 
the million settlement received related to tlc vision has been recorded as a gain of million net of million for its obligations to be paid to the minority interests in other income and expense for the period 
during the transitional period  the company recorded million of income from the termination of the surgicare agreement to purchase aspen healthcare from the company 
on may   the company agreed to sell the capital stock of its aspen healthcare aspen subsidiary to surgicare inc surgicare for a purchase price of million in cash and warrants for  shares of common stock of surgicare with an exercise price of per share 
on june   the purchase agreement for the transaction was amended due to the failure of surgicare to meet its obligations under the agreement 
the amendment established a new closing date of september  and required surgicare to issue  shares of surgicare common stock and to pay million to the company  prior to closing  all of which was non refundable 
surgicare failed to perform under the purchase agreement  as amended  and as a result  the purchase agreement was terminated and the company recorded the gain in other income and expense for the period 
during the transitional period  the company recorded a reduction in the carrying value of capital assets of million  within the refractive segment  reflecting the disposal of certain of the company s lasers 
the amount is included in other income and expense 
these lasers do not represent the most current technology available and the company has made the decision to dispose of them below their carrying cost 
interest expense income  net reflects interest revenue from the company s cash position offset by interest expense from debt and lease obligations 
an increase to debt in the second quarter of fiscal from the corporate headquarters sale leaseback arrangement resulted in additional increases to interest costs 
interest revenues have decreased since the company has reduced cash and cash equivalent balances during the seven months ended december  compared to the corresponding period in the prior year 
in addition interest yields on cash balances have been lower  offset by a gain in foreign currency translation to us dollars related to the company s canadian operations 
income tax expense increased to million for the seven month period ended december  from million for the seven months ended december  the million tax expense consisted of state taxes of million for certain of the company s subsidiaries where a consolidated state tax return cannot be filed and million of foreign taxes for one of the company s foreign subsidiaries 
the loss for the seven months ended december  was million or per share compared to a loss of million or per share for the seven months ended december  this decreased loss primarily reflected the positive impact of the antitrust settlement and cost cutting initiatives partially offset by the reduction in refractive procedures and revenues 
as a result of the laservision acquisition in may  there were more common shares outstanding during the seven months ended december  fiscal year ended may  compared to fiscal year ended may  revenues for fiscal were million  which was a decrease over million for the prior fiscal year 
approximately of total revenues were derived from refractive services in fiscal compared to in fiscal revenues from refractive activities for fiscal were million  which is lower than the prior fiscal year s million 
approximately  procedures were performed in fiscal compared to approximately  procedures in fiscal management believes that the decrease in procedure volume and the associated reduction of revenue was indicative of the overall condition of the laser vision correction industry 
the laser vision correction industry has experienced uncertainty resulting from a wide range in consumer prices for laser vision correction procedures  the recent bankruptcies of a number of deep discount laser vision correction companies  the ongoing safety and effectiveness concerns arising from the lack of long term follow up data and negative news stories focusing on patients with unfavorable outcomes from procedures performed at centers competing with tlc vision centers 
in addition  as an elective procedure  laser vision correction volumes have been further depressed by economic conditions currently being experienced in north america 
the company maintains its stated objective of being a premium provider of laser vision correction services in an industry that has faced significant pricing pressures 
despite pricing pressures in the industry  the company s net revenue after doctor compensation per procedure  for fiscal increased by in comparison to fiscal the increase was largely a result of deep discount surgery providers filing for bankruptcy thus relieving some of the price pressures that have occurred in prior fiscal years 
revenues from other healthcare services was million in fiscal  an increase of over in comparison to million in fiscal approximately of total revenues were derived from other healthcare services in fiscal compared to in fiscal the increase in revenues reflected revenue growth in the network marketing and management and the professional healthcare facility management subsidiaries  while revenues in the secondary care management  and asset management subsidiaries reflected little or moderate growth 
cost of revenues from other healthcare services was million in fiscal  an increase of over in comparison to million in fiscal the increase in cost of revenue reflected the increase in revenue growth in the network marketing and management and the professional healthcare facility management subsidiaries 
the cost of revenues for other healthcare services centers in fiscal included the cost of tlc visions eyevantange 
com subsidiary 
eyevantage 
com incurred a significant amount of cost without offsetting revenue  thereby resulting in cost of revenues increasing at a lesser rate than the increase in the associated revenues in fiscal net loss from other healthcare services was million in fiscal  in comparison to a net loss of million for the loss for fiscal included million for the impairment of goodwill and million for the write down of investments in other healthcare services 
the loss for fiscal included the activities of eyevantage 
com  inc  which generated losses of million 
net loss for fiscal does not reflect the activities of eyevantage 
com  inc due to the decision by the company in fiscal to cease material funding of this subsidiary and the resulting decision by eyevantage 
com  inc to abandon its e commerce enterprise 
the profit from other healthcare services for fiscal of million excluding the impairment and investment write downs  reflected an increase from the loss of million for fiscal excluding eyevantage 
com  inc and restructuring costs 
the improved profitability for was due primarily to increased revenues while managing the cost structure thus increasing gross margins 
in the final quarter of fiscal and during fiscal  the company entered into practice management agreements with a number of surgeons resulting in an increase in intangible assets to reflect the value assigned to these agreements 
these intangible assets are amortized over the term of the applicable agreements 
these agreements have resulted  either directly or indirectly  in lower per procedure fees being paid to the applicable surgeons and a corresponding reduction in doctors compensation to offset the increased amortization costs 
the result was an increase to the net revenue after doctors compensation per procedure ratio 
the company s operating results for fiscal included a non cash pre tax charge of million to record the impairment in the carrying value of certain practice management agreements on which the carrying value exceeded the fair value as of may  the cost of refractive revenues from eye care centers for fiscal was million  less than cost of refractive revenues of million in fiscal these reductions were in line with reduced doctors compensation resulting from lower procedure volumes  reductions in royalty fees on laser usage and reduced personnel costs 
these reductions were offset by a reduction in the carrying value of capital assets of million reflecting a reduction of the company s lasersight lasers to and two visx lasers to  each 
these lasers do not represent the most current technology available and the company has made the decision to write the lasers down to current market value and will evaluate the best option for utilization or upgrade of these lasers 
the cost of revenues for refractive centers include a fixed cost component for infrastructure of personnel  facilities and minimum equipment usage fees which has resulted in cost of revenues decreasing at a lesser rate for fiscal  as compared to fiscal than the decrease in the associated revenues 
cost of revenues of owned centers include the cost of doctor compensation 
cost of doctor compensation varies in relation to revenues 
accordingly  when combined with the conversion of a number of owned centers to managed centers  the cost of revenues of owned centers reflect a much larger variance in the decrease in the costs of revenues in comparison to managed centers 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal  a decrease of million or 
this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased marketing costs  decreased infrastructure costs and reductions associated with corporate advantage and third party payer programs  each identified in conjunction with the company s cost reduction initiatives 
interest income expense reflects interest revenue from the company s net cash and cash equivalent position 
interest revenue has been consistently decreasing throughout the year as a result of the company s declining cash position and a decrease on the interest yields throughout the year 
this decrease also includes an increase in interest expense resulting from additional long term debt and as a result of the sale leaseback transaction of the corporate international headquarters in canada in the second quarter 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in the current fiscal year from million in fiscal  primarily as the result of the company s early adoption of sfas no 
 thus eliminating the requirement for the goodwill amortization 
the adoption of this statement resulted in decreased amortization expense of approximately million for fiscal depreciation and amortization expense has also decreased due to fewer capital additions resulting from limited development of new centers and the closure of certain existing centers 
the company s adoption of sfas resulted in a transitional impairment loss of million  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the seventh quarter 
in addition  the company s operating results for fiscal included a non cash pretax charge of million to reduce the carrying value of goodwill for which the carrying value exceeded the fair value as of may   including million related to the impairment of goodwill from the acquisition of laservision and million for the impairment of goodwill from prior acquisitions 
intangible assets whose useful lives are not indefinite are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable agreement to a maximum of years 
current amortization periods range from to years 
in establishing these long term contractual relationships with the company  key surgeons in many cases have agreed to receive reduced fees for laser vision correction procedures performed 
the reduction in doctors compensation offsets in part the increased amortization of the intangible practice management agreements 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  requires long lived assets included within the scope of the statement be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of those long lived assets might not be recoverable that is  information indicates that an impairment might exist 
given the significant decrease in the trading price of the company s common stock  current period operating or cash flow loss combined with its history of operating or cash flow losses  the company identified certain practice management agreements where the recoverability was impaired 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million in tlc vision made its first investment in lasersight incorporated lasersight prior to the beginning of fiscal lasersight is a company involved in the research and development of new laser technology 
from the time of purchase through the third quarter of fiscal  the market value of the investment exceeded the carrying value at each quarter end 
however  by november   the company believed that the impairment should be considered other than temporary for a number of reasons including the impairment is very substantial relative to the original purchase price  the impairment has persisted for more than nine months  sufficient time has passed to determine that the market place has not reacted well to fda approval of lasersight s new technology 
as a result  the company recorded a total impairment charge of million during fiscal with respect to its investment in laservision tlc vision wrote down its investment in laservision by million in the period prior to the merger  due to an other than temporary decline in its value 
finally  the company has recorded impairment charges of million on its investment in britton vision associates and of million on other investments 
during fiscal  the company implemented a restructuring program to reduce employee costs in line with current revenue levels  close certain under performing centers and eliminating duplicate functions caused by the merger with laservision 
by may   this program resulted in total cost for severance and office closures of million of which million was paid out in cash prior to may  all restructuring costs will be financed through the company s cash and cash equivalents 
a the company continued its objective of reducing employee costs in line with revenues 
this activity occurred in two stages with total charges of million 
the first stage of reductions were identified in the second and third quarters of fiscal and resulted in restructuring charges of million  all of which had been paid out in cash or options by the end of the fiscal year 
this reduction impacted employees of whom were working in laser centers with the remaining working within various corporate functions 
the second stage of the cost reduction required the company to identify the impact of its acquisition of laservision on may  and eliminate surplus positions resulting from the acquisition 
the majority of these costs were paid by the end of december b as part of the company restructuring subsequent to its acquisition of laservision in may  six centers were identified for closure such centers were identified based on managements earning criteria  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization 
these closures resulted in restructuring charges of million reflecting a write down of fixed assets of million and cash costs of million which include net lease commitments net of costs to sublet and sub lease income of million  ongoing laser commitments of million  termination costs of a doctor s contract of million and severance costs impacting center employees of million 
the lease costs will be paid out over the remaining term of the lease 
c the company also identified seven centers where management determined that given the current and future expected procedures  the centers had excess leased capacity or the lease arrangements were not economical 
the company assessed these seven centers to determine whether the excess space should be subleased or whether the centers should be relocated 
the company provided million related to the costs associated with sub leasing the excess or unoccupied facilities 
a total of million of this provision related to non cash costs of writing down fixed assets and million represented net future cash costs for lease commitments and costs to sublet available space offset by sub lease income that is projected to be generated 
the lease costs will be paid out over the remaining term of the lease 
the following table details restructuring charges incurred for the year ended may  accrual accrual balance balance at at restructuring cash non cash may  cash non cash december  charges payments reductions payments reductions severance   lease commitments  net of sublease income    termination costs of doctors contracts laser commitments write down of fixed assets   total restructuring and other charges       income tax expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease reflected the company s losses incurred in fiscal offset by the impact of the tax liabilities associated with the company s investments in profitable subsidiaries that are less than owned and the requirement to reflect minimum tax liabilities relevant in canada  united states and certain other jurisdictions 
as of may   the company had net operating losses available for carry forward for income tax purposes of approximately million  which were available to reduce taxable income of future years 
the canadian losses can only be utilized by the source company whereas the united states losses are utilized on a united states consolidated basis 
the canadian losses of million expire as follows may  the united states losses of million expire between and the canadian and united states losses include amounts of million and million respectively relating to the acquisitions of and beaconeye  the availability and timing of utilization of which may be restricted 
the loss for fiscal was million  or per share  compared to a loss of million or per share for fiscal this increased loss primarily reflected the impact of reduced refractive revenues  the reduction in carrying values of capital and intangible assets  the reduction in the carrying value of goodwill and the write down of investments offset partially by reduced costs and decreased depreciation and amortization 
the company has undertaken initiatives intended to address patient  optometric and ophthalmic industry trends and expectations to improve laser vision correction procedure and revenue volumes 
cost initiatives are targeting effective use of funds and a growth initiative is focusing on the future development opportunities for the company in the laser vision eye care service industry 
fiscal year ended may  compared to fiscal year ended may  revenues for fiscal were million  which was a decrease compared to revenues of million for fiscal approximately of total revenues were derived from refractive services as compared to in fiscal revenues from eye care centers for fiscal were million  which was lower than revenues of million for fiscal approximately  procedures were performed in fiscal compared to  procedures in fiscal the decrease in procedure volume and the associated reduction of revenue reflects the condition of the laser vision correction industry  which had experienced uncertainty due to a wide range in consumer prices for laser vision correction procedures  the bankruptcies of a number of deep discount laser vision correction companies and the ongoing safety and effectiveness concerns arising from the lack of long term follow up data and negative news stories focusing on patients with unfavorable outcomes from procedures performed at competing centers 
due to the pricing pressures in the industry and the lower procedure prices offered pursuant to discounts associated with the company s corporate advantage program  the company s net revenue after doctor compensation  per procedure  for fiscal declined by in comparison to fiscal in the final quarter of fiscal and during fiscal  the company completed practice management agreements with a number of surgeons resulting in an increase in intangible assets to reflect the value assigned to these agreements 
these intangible assets are being amortized over the term of the applicable agreements 
these agreements have resulted  either directly or indirectly  in lower per procedure fees being paid to the applicable surgeons and a corresponding reduction in doctors compensation to offset the increased amortization costs 
the result was an increase to the net revenue after doctors compensation per procedure ratio 
the cost of refractive revenues from eye care centers for fiscal was million  which was lower than fiscal s cost of refractive revenues of million 
this reduction was primarily due to reduced doctors compensation resulting from lower procedure volumes  lower royalty fees on laser usage and lower personnel costs 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this reflected increased marketing costs aimed at raising consumer awareness of tlc vision s brand 
in addition  the increased expense was due to increased consulting costs  legal costs and infrastructure costs incurred to support our growth strategy 
these costs were partially offset by reductions associated with corporate advantage and third party payer programs identified in conjunction with the company s cost reduction initiatives 
interest income expense and other expenses reflected interest revenue from the company s cash position which resulted from positive cash flow from operations and the result of a public offering in the fourth quarter of fiscal the lack of any material additions to long term debt and capital leases on equipment resulted in reducing interest costs on debt  as the various debt instruments approach maturity 
reduced cash and cash equivalent balances during the year combined with lower interest yields resulted in lower interest revenues 
the increase in depreciation expense was largely a result of new centers and the additional depreciation and amortization associated with the company s acquisitions during fiscal and the significant increase in the amortization of intangibles was the result of successfully establishing long term contractual relationships with a number of surgeons during the final quarter of fiscal and during fiscal goodwill and intangibles are amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the applicable agreement to a maximum of fifteen years 
amortization periods used during fiscal range from five to fifteen years 
in establishing the long term contractual relationships with these key surgeons  the surgeon in many cases had agreed to receive reduced fees for laser vision correction procedures performed 
the reduction in doctors compensation partially offsets the increased amortization of the intangible practice management agreements

due to a deteriorating relationship with the operations management team and the company s strategic decision to withdraw from the management of secondary care practices where possible  the company transferred its investment to an equity investment in return for a future earnings percentage 
the equity investment has not acknowledged a liability to the company for this investment  and the company had not received any funds from the equity investment s earnings from the transferred investment 
as a result the company deemed it prudent to provide against the potential loss resulting from the inability to recover value of the investment transferred to the equity investment 
b close three eye care centers for which the company recorded costs of million  sell its ownership in another eye care center  which created a loss of million and incurred a cost of million to terminate plans to open another eye care center 
during fiscal  the company had undertaken to restructure its operations to eliminate those centers  which were identified as not capable of being profitable 
these centers had been impacted by a number of challenges such as i proximity to existing centers managed by the company  ii local marketplace heavily impacted by discount laser vision correction providers which impaired the ability to compete as a premium laser vision correction provider  iii expectations of optometric network to generate sufficient interest in laser vision correction were not met  and iv the occupancy costs of a center acquired as part of a multi center acquisition impacting the ability to lower costs in line with revenues
