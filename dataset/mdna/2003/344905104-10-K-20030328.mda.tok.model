item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements  and the footnotes thereto  contained elsewhere in this report and the statements regarding forward looking information and the uncertainties that could affect our future performance described below in this report 
our principal operating subsidiary is foothill independent bank the bank  which is a california state chartered bank and a member of the federal reserve system  which accounts for substantially all of our consolidated revenues and income 
accordingly  the following discussion focuses primarily on the bank s operations and financial condition 
results of operations overview 
the principal determinant of a bank s income is net interest income  which is the difference between the interest that a bank earns on loans  investments and other interest earning assets  and its interest expense  which consists primarily of the interest it must pay to attract and retain deposits and the interest that it pays on its other interest bearing liabilities 
a bank s interest income and interest expense are  in turn  affected by a number of factors  some of which are outside of its control  including the monetary policies of the federal reserve board and national and local economic conditions which affect interest rates and also the demand for loans and the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations 
during the federal reserve board adopted and implemented a monetary policy that was designed to reduce market rates of interest in an effort to stimulate the us economy  which was heading into recession 
that policy continued through as the hoped for economic recovery has been slow to develop 
as a result  the prime rate of interest charged by most banks declined from to during and it remained at until november of when it declined further to 
those monetary policies  combined with the continued softness in the united states economy  caused the average rate of interest earned on our interest earning assets to decline to in fiscal from in fiscal and in fiscal despite that decline  we still achieved an increase of  or  in net earnings in to  from  in the increase in net earnings was primarily due to a  increase in net interest income  which was partially offset by a  increase in non interest expense 
the increase in net interest income was attributable  in turn  to a decline in interest expense 
as indicated in the following table  net earnings for represented a return on average assets of and a return on average equity of  compared to and  respectively  for return on assets return on equity dividend payout ratio equity to asset ratio net interest income net interest income increased by  or  in as compared to  due to a decline in interest expense of  which offset a  decline in interest income in the reduction in interest expense was primarily attributable to lower market rates of interest on deposits that was the result  principally  of the lowering of market rates of interest by the federal reserve board  and  to a lesser extent  reductions in the average volume of outstanding time deposits  including those in denominations of  or more tcds  as a result of our decision to allow those deposits to be withdrawn on their maturity rather than seeking their renewal 
the decline in interest income in also was primarily attributable to declining market rates of interest that resulted in reductions in the interest rates we were able to charge on new loans that we originated during the year and in the interest rates on variable rate loans that repriced downward as market rates of interest declined 
information concerning average interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  along with the average interest rates charged and paid thereon is set forth in the following table 
averages were computed based upon daily balances and dollars are in thousands

rate sensitivity  net interest margins and market risk 
rate sensitivity 
like other banks and bank holding companies  our margins that is  the difference between yields we are able to realize  and therefore the interest income that we are able to generate  on loans and other interest earning assets  on the one hand  and the interest we pay on deposits  on the other hand are affected by a number of factors  including the relative percentages or the mix of our assets  between loans  on the one hand  on which we are able to obtain higher rates of interest  and investment securities  federal funds sold and funds held in interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions  on the other hand  on which yields generally are lower  variable and fixed rate loans in the loan portfolio  and demand and savings deposits  on the one hand  and time deposits on which we pay higher rates of interest on the other hand 
impact on net interest margins of the mix of fixed and variable rate loans 
as a general rule  in an interest rate environment like the one we have experienced during the past two years  a bank with a relatively high percentage of variable rate loans will experience a decline in net interest margins during a period of declining market rates of interest  because those loans will reprice automatically when market rates of interest decline 
on the other hand  a bank with a large proportion of fixed rate loans  generally  will experience an increase in net interest margins  because the interest rates on those fixed rate loans will not decline in response to declines in market rates of interest 
in a period of increasing interest rates  however  the interest margin of banks with a high proportion of fixed rate loans generally will suffer because they will be unable to reprice those loans to fully offset the increase in the rates of interest they must offer to retain maturing time deposits and attract new deposits 
by contrast  a bank with a higher proportion of variable loans in an environment of increasing market rates of interest will be able to more fully offset the impact of rising rates of interest on the amounts they must pay to retain existing and attract new deposits 
the following table sets forth the maturities of our loans  and the mix of fixed and variable rate loans  as of december  in thousands maturing within one year one to five years after five years total total fixed rate loans total variable rate loans total impact on net interest margins of the mix of demand  savings and time deposits 
in a period of declining market rates of interest  all other things being equal  a bank with a greater proportion of demand and savings accounts  as compared to time deposits  is likely to have a higher interest margin than a bank with a greater proportion of time deposits  because a bank must wait for its time deposits to mature before it can implement reductions in the rates of interest it must pay on those deposits in response to declining market rates of interest  whereas such reductions can be implemented more quickly on savings and money market deposits 
by contrast  in a period of increasing market rates of interest  all other things being equal  a bank with a higher proportion of time deposits will generally have a higher interest margin than a bank with a higher proportion of savings deposits and a lower proportion of time deposits  because a bank need not increase the interest it pays on its time deposits until they mature  while it must increase its interest rates on savings and money market deposits to be able to retain them in response to increasing market rates of interest 
the average amounts in thousands of and the average rates paid on deposits  by type  in the year ended december  are summarized below year ended december  average balance average rate noninterest bearing demand deposits savings deposits time deposits total deposits the following table sets forth changes in interest earned  including loan fees  and interest paid in each of the years ended december  and and the extent to which those changes were attributable to changes in the volume or changes in the mix of interest earning assets and changes in the volume or changes in the mix of interest bearing liabilities 
changes in interest earned and interest paid due to both rate and volume have been allocated to the change due to volume and the change due to rate in proportion to the relationship of the absolute dollar amounts of the changes in each

net interest margin in and we attempt to reduce our exposure to market risks associated with interest rate fluctuations in an effort to increase  or at least maintain  our net interest margin  by seeking i to attract and maintain a significant volume of demand and savings deposits that are not as sensitive to interest rate fluctuations as are tcds and other time deposits  and ii to match opportunities to reprice earning assets  particularly loans  in response to changes in market rates of interest which require or cause repricing of deposits 
we have continued sales and marketing programs designed to increase our loan volume and  also the volume of our demand and savings deposits 
we also decided to allow some of our higher priced time deposits to run off as they matured  rather than to seek their renewal 
during  the average volume of loans outstanding increased by  or  and the average volume of demand  savings and money market deposits increased to of average total deposits  while time deposits  including tcds  declined to of average total deposits  compared to and  respectively  for those percentages were and  respectively for additionally  in order to mitigate the impact of declining rates of interest on our interest income  during the fourth quarter of we adopted a new loan repricing policy which places an interest rate floor  currently at  that is applicable to all new variable rate loans that we make 
our net interest margin ie  tax adjusted net interest income stated as a percentage of average interest earning assets was for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  that decline was primarily due to the decrease in interest rates as mentioned above 
however  notwithstanding that decline  we believe that our net interest margin continues to exceed the average net interest margin for california based  publicly traded banks and bank holding companies with assets ranging from to million the peer group banks  because we have been able to maintain the ratio of demand and savings deposits to total deposits at a higher level than that of our peer group banks and we were able to increase the volume of our loans which generate higher yields than do our other interest earning assets 
we have again instituted new sales and marketing programs for that are designed to increase our loan volume and also the volume of our demand and savings deposits 
however  we may find it necessary or prudent to increase time deposits to fund any resulting increases in loan volume 
we currently believe that our net interest margin in will continue to decline at approximately the same level as in  because we currently expect that any resulting increases in interest income we are able to generate in from increased loan volume will be largely offset by a combination of i the increase in interest expense that will result from the increase in the volume of our deposits  and ii rates of interest that we are able to charge on loans  which are largely determined by the federal reserve board s monetary policies and affected by the economic conditions in the united states 
however  there are a number of uncertainties and risks that could adversely affect our net interest margin in  including i increased competition in our market areas  both from banks and other types of financial institutions as well as from securities brokerage firms and mutual funds that offer competing investment products  and ii the possibility that the economic slowdown will continue longer than is currently anticipated  which could result in reduced loan activity and in a greater decline in market rates of interest 
the ability to maintain our net interest margin is not entirely within our control because the interest rates we are able to charge on loans and the interest rates we must offer to maintain and attract deposits are affected by the monetary policies established and implemented by the federal reserve board and by competitive conditions in our service areas 
in addition  the effect on a bank s net interest margin of changes in market rates of interest will depend on the types and maturities of its deposits and earning assets 
for example  a change in interest rates paid on deposits in response to changes in market rates of interest can be implemented more quickly in the case of savings deposits and money market accounts than with respect to time deposits as to which a change in interest rates generally cannot be implemented until such deposits mature 
in addition  a change in rates of interest paid on deposits can and often does lead consumers to move their deposits from one type of deposit to another or to shift funds from deposits to non bank investments or from such investments to bank deposit accounts or instruments  which also will affect a bank s net interest margin 
provision for loan and lease losses 
like virtually all banks and other financial institutions  we follow the practice of maintaining a reserve the loan loss reserve for possible losses on loans and leases that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the banking business 
when it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely  the carrying value of the loan is reduced to its realizable value 
this reduction  which is referred to as a loan charge off  is charged against the loan loss reserve 
the amount of the loan loss reserve is increased periodically to replenish the reserve after it has been reduced due to loan charge offs and to reflect changes in i the volume of outstanding loans  and ii the risk of potential losses due to a deterioration in the condition of borrowers or in the value of property securing non performing loans  or due to adverse changes in national or local economic conditions 
those increases and additions are made through a charge against income referred to as the provision for loan and lease losses 
recoveries of loans previously charged off are added back to and  therefore  also have the effect of increasing the loan loss reserve 
although we employ economic models that are based on bank regulatory guidelines and industry standards to evaluate and determine the sufficiency of the loan loss reserve and  thereby  also the amount of provisions required to be made for potential loan losses  those determinations involve judgments or forecasts about future economic conditions and other events that are subject to a number of uncertainties  some of which are outside of our ability to control 
see the discussion below under the caption forward looking information and uncertainties regarding future performance 
in the event those judgments or forecasts are proven  by subsequent events or circumstances  to have been incorrect  it could become necessary in the future to increase the loan loss reserve  which would require us to take additional charges to income that would adversely affect our operating results 
during we made provisions for potential loan losses of  as compared to  during and  at december  the loan loss reserve was approximately  or of total loans and leases outstanding  compared to approximately  or of total loans and leases outstanding at december  the overall quality of our loan portfolio improved in  as it had in  which enabled us to reduce the provision made for potential loan losses in as compared to and the following table sets forth an analysis of our loan and lease loss experience  by category  for the past three years with dollar amounts stated in thousands 
the amount of the loan charge offs  and the ratios of net loan charge offs to the loan loss reserve and net loan charge offs to the provision for loan losses  in were substantially greater than in or in that was attributable to loan charge offs in due to the bankruptcy of a corporate borrower 
average amount of loans and leases outstanding loan and lease loss reserve at beginning of year charge offs domestic loans commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer other total charge offs recoveries domestic loans commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer total recoveries net recoveries net charge offs additions charged to operations loan and lease loss reserve balance at end of year ratios net charge offs during the year to average loans and leases outstanding during the year loan loss reserve to total gross loans net loan charge offs to loan loss reserve net loan charge offs to provision for loan losses loan loss reserve to non performing loans net of unearned discount 
we do not have any loans outstanding to borrowers in foreign countries and therefore there are no foreign loan charge offs or recoveries to report for any of the periods presented in the table above 
the amount of non performing loans which consist primarily of loans for which there have been no payments of principal or interest for more than days at december  was  or of total loans then outstanding  compared to  or  of total loans outstanding at december  and  or of total loans outstanding at december  the ratio of the loan loss reserve to non performing loans was at december   as compared to and at december  and  respectively 
net loan charge offs totaled  in  which represented one hundredth of one percent of average loans and leases outstanding during the year 
in  recoveries of previously charged off loans exceeded loan charge offs by  in  loan charge offs totaled  however  but for the charge off of loans to a single corporate borrower  recoveries of previously charged off loans would have exceeded loan charge offs by  in non interest income 
in  non interest income also sometimes referred to as other income increased by  or as compared to the increase was attributable to a number of factors  the most significant of which was a one time  gain on the sale of a parcel of real property on which the bank had foreclosed several years ago 
in  non interest income increased by  or as compared to  primarily as a result of increases in transaction fees and service charges on deposit accounts and other banking transactions  and a one time  gain realized on the sale of a parcel of real property that the bank had been using as a parking lot  but which it no longer needed 
non interest expense 
non interest expense also sometimes referred to as other expense consists primarily of i salaries and other employee expenses  ii occupancy and furniture and equipment expenses  and iii other operating and miscellaneous expenses that include insurance premiums  marketing expenses  data processing costs  and professional fees and expenses 
in order to attract a higher volume of non interest bearing demand and lower cost savings and money market deposits as a means of maintaining the bank s net interest margin  it has been our policy to provide a higher level of personal service to our customers than the level of service that is typically provided by many of our competitors 
as a result  we have more banking personnel than many of our competitors of comparable size  which is reflected in our non interest expense 
however  we believe that this higher level of service has helped us to retain our existing deposit customers and attract new customers which has enabled us to achieve an average net interest margin that exceeds the average net interest margin of the banks in our peer group 
non interest expense increased by approximately  or  in as compared to primarily due to increases in salaries and in employee benefit expenses and  to a lesser extent  the addition of personnel 
the increase in salaries was primarily attributable to a general increase in employee base salaries and bonuses paid to loan officers and other employees for meeting loan and deposit growth targets established for notwithstanding that increase  however  due primarily to the increase in our net interest income in  we were able to improve our efficiency ratio to from in the efficiency ratio is  basically  the ratio of non interest expense adjusted to exclude non recurring expenses to the sum of net interest income and non interest income as adjusted to exclude any non recurring income 
in our non interest expenses increased by  or  as compared to  primarily as a result of our opening  in december  of a new banking office  in temecula  california  that necessitated the addition of new personnel and increased our occupancy and equipment expenses in that increase in non interest expense caused our efficiency ratio in to increase to from in income taxes 
income taxes increased by approximately  or in and  or in  in each case as compared to the prior year  primarily as a result of the increases in pre tax income in those two years  in each case as compared to the preceding year 
the provision that we make for income taxes is based on  among other things  the ability to use certain income tax benefits available under state and federal income tax laws to reduce our income tax liability 
as of december   the total of the unused income tax benefits referred to in our consolidated financial statements as a deferred tax assets  available to reduce our income taxes in future periods was  such tax benefits expire over time unless used and the realization of those benefits is dependent on generating taxable income in the future in amounts sufficient to utilize those tax benefits prior to their expiration 
we have made a judgment that it is more likely than not that we will generate taxable income in future years sufficient to fully utilize those benefits 
in the event that our income were to decline in future periods such that it was no longer more likely than not that we would be able to fully utilize those benefits  we would be required to establish a valuation reserve for the benefits we estimate would be lost 
establishment of such a reserve would require us to increase the provision we make for income taxes  which would have the effect of reducing our net income 
financial condition total assets 
our average total assets increased during by approximately  or  compared to average total assets for the increase in average total assets was primarily due to an increase of  or  in the average loans and leases outstanding  together with an increase in the average volume of federal funds sold of  or  which offset a decrease in the average volume of other earning assets  including overnight repurchase agreements  time deposits held at other banks  and investment securities 
we currently anticipate that we will achieve modest asset growth in the year ending december   which is expected to result from increased lending and deposit activity that we expect will be generated by our marketing programs 
loans 
set forth below is information regarding the average volume of our loans  by type or category of loan  for each of the years in the five year period ended december  december  in thousands types of loans commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer lease financing all other including overdrafts subtotal less unearned discount reserve for loan and lease losses total the maturities of our loans  as of december   presented by type or category of loan  is set forth below in thousands maturing within one year one to five years after five years total commercial  financial and agricultural real estate construction real estate mortgage consumer lease financing all other total deposits 
during we conducted programs by which we were able to increase deposits to provide additional funds that we used to increase loan volume 
overall  in the average volume of deposits increased by  or  as compared to the average volume of deposits during contributing to that increase was an increase of  or  in the volume of our core deposits  made up of demand deposits  which do not bear interest  and savings and money market deposits  on which we pay lower rates of interests than on time deposits 
at the same time  during  the average volume of time deposits including those in denominations of  or more decreased by  or 
as a result  our core demand  savings and money market deposits represented of average total deposits in as compared to in  with time deposits including those in denominations of  or more representing of average total deposits in as compared to in the decreases in the volume of time deposits  together with decreases in interest rates that we paid  primarily in response to decreases in market rates of interest  resulted in a decrease in interest expense in as compared to see the discussion above under the captions results of operations net interest income and results of operations rate sensitivity  net interest margins and market risk 
the average amounts in thousands of and the average rates paid on deposits in each of  and are summarized below average balance average rate average balance average rate average balance average rate noninterest bearing demand deposits savings deposits time deposits total deposits includes now  super now  and money market deposit accounts 
includes time certificates of deposit in denominations greater than and less than  set forth below is a maturity schedule of domestic time certificates of deposit of  or more with amounts stated in thousands as of december  at december  in thousands three months or less over three through six months over six through twelve months over twelve months liquidity management 
liquidity management policies attempt to achieve a matching of sources and uses of funds in order to enable us to fund the requirements of our customers for loans and for deposit withdrawals 
in conformity with those policies  we maintain a number of short term sources of funds to meet periodic increases in loan demand and deposit withdrawals and maturities 
at december   the principal sources of liquidity consisted of  in cash and demand balances due from other banks and  of federal funds sold  which together totaled  other sources of liquidity include  in securities available for sale  of which approximately  mature within one year   in securities held to maturity which mature within one year  and  in interest bearing deposits at other financial institutions  which mature in months or less 
in addition  substantially all of the bank s installment loans and leases  the amount of which aggregated  at december   require regular installment payments from customers  providing us with a steady flow of cash funds 
we also maintain a line of credit from the federal home loan bank  the amount of which was  as of december  borrowings under that credit line are secured by a pledge of some of our outstanding loans 
we also have established loan facilities that would enable us to borrow up to  of federal funds from other banks and we have an account with the federal reserve bank of san francisco that will also allow us to borrow at its discount window should the need arise 
finally  if necessary  we could obtain additional cash by means of sales of time certificates of deposit into the cd market 
however  as a general rule  it has been and continues to be our policy to make use of borrowings under the credit line or loan facilities to fund short term cash requirements  before selling securities or reducing deposit balances at other banks and before selling time certificates of deposit 
in late december of we borrowed  under the federal home loan bank credit line to fund increases in loans and seasonal withdrawals of demand and savings deposits which typically occur during the holiday season 
we repaid those borrowings in their entirety at the end of january and there has been no other borrowing outstanding under the credit line  or any of our other borrowing facilities  again in however  we expect that we may make use of that federal home loan bank credit line and other credit loan facilities in the future primarily to fund our short term cash requirements during periods of either significant loan growth or increased deposit withdrawals 
we believe that our cash and cash equivalent resources  together with available borrowings under our line of credit and credit facilities  will be sufficient to enable us to meet any increases in demand for loans and leases and any increase in deposit withdrawals that might occur in the foreseeable future 
capital resources and dividends 
it has been and continues to be the objective of our board of directors to retain earnings that are needed to meet capital requirements under applicable government regulations and to support our growth 
at the same time  it is the policy of the board of directors to pay cash dividends if earnings exceed the amounts required to meet that objective 
pursuant to that policy  the company has paid regular quarterly cash dividends since september of and  in january of  the board of directors declared an per share cash dividend  which is the th consecutive quarterly cash dividend declared since the current dividend policy was adopted by the board of directors 
however  the board may change the amount or frequency of cash dividends to the extent that it deems necessary or appropriate to achieve our objective of maintaining capital in amounts sufficient to support our growth 
for example the retention of earnings in previous years enabled us to fund the opening of four new banking offices and extend the bank s market areas  all of which have contributed to our increased profitability and the maintenance of our capital adequacy ratios well above regulatory requirements 
we continue to evaluate and explore opportunities to expand our market into areas such as eastern los angeles county  western san bernardino county  north orange county and northern riverside county  all of which are contiguous to our existing markets 
the number of independent banks based in our market areas has declined significantly  due to a consolidation in the banking industry that occurred approximately two to three years ago 
we believe that this consolidation has created opportunities for us to increase our market share in those areas 
we have taken advantage of those opportunities by establishing a substantial number of new customer relationships and increasing the volume of our demand  savings and money market deposit balances 
we also opened a branch banking office in the city of temecula  california  in late december of  which is our th banking office  and we believe that there are still additional expansion and growth opportunities that we will seek to take advantage of in the future 
stock repurchase programs 
in january of the board of directors authorized a stock repurchase program that provides for the company to repurchase up to  of its common stock 
repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions when opportunities to do so at favorable prices present themselves  in compliance with securities and exchange commission sec guidelines 
in may of we completed a previously authorized open market and private stock repurchase program which began in late and resulted in the purchase of a total of  shares of our common stock for an aggregate price of approximately  sale of trust preferred securities 
in december of  we completed a private sale of  of trust preferred securities to an institutional investor as part of a pooled securitization transaction by that investor 
the trust preferred securities mature in years  and are redeemable at our option beginning after five years 
we are required to make quarterly interest payments  initially at a rate of  which will re set semi annually at the three month libor london inter bank offered rate rate plus 
the trust preferred securities are subordinated to other borrowings that may be obtained by the company in the future and qualify as tier capital for regulatory purposes 
see discussion below regarding our regulatory capital requirements 
the proceeds from the sale of the trust preferred securities will be used to fund the continued growth of the bank and may also be used to repurchase our common stock under our stock repurchase plan and to purchase bank owned life insurance on key employees of the bank 
such insurance which is commonly referred to in the banking industry as boli would be purchased for two primary purposes i to provide a source of funds to offset the bank s future payment obligations under its employee retirement and benefit plans  and ii to protect the bank against the costs or losses that could occur as a result of the death of any key employees 
regulatory capital requirements 
federal banking agencies require banks to maintain a minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk adjusted assets of and a minimum ratio of tier capital essentially  the sum of a bank s capital stock and retained earnings  less any intangibles to risk adjusted assets of 
in addition to the risked based guidelines  federal banking regulators require banking organizations to maintain a minimum amount of tier capital to total average assets  referred to as the leverage ratio 
for a banking organization rated in the highest of the five categories used by regulators to rate banking organizations  the minimum leverage ratio of tier capital to average assets must be 
in addition to these uniform risk based capital guidelines and leverage ratios that apply across the industry  federal and state bank regulatory agencies have the discretion to set minimum capital requirements for specific banking institutions at rates significantly above the minimum guidelines and ratios and encourage banks to maintain their ratios above those minimums as a matter of prudent banking practices 
the risk based capital ratio is determined by weighting our assets in accordance with certain risk factors and  the higher the risk profile of the assets  the greater is the amount of capital that is required to maintain an adequate risk based capital ratio  which generally is at least 
additionally  the level of supervision to which a bank will be subject by federal bank regulatory authorities will depend largely on the extent to which a bank meets or exceeds federally mandated leverage capital ratios 
a bank that maintains a leverage capital ratio of or more generally will be categorized by federal bank regulatory agencies as well capitalized and  therefore  as a general matter will be subject to less extensive regulatory supervision than banks with lower leverage capital ratios 
however  a bank with a leverage capital ratio exceeding may be downgraded by its primary federal regulatory agency due to other factors 
the bank has been categorized as a well capitalized institution by its primary federal banking agency and its tier capital and tier risk based capital ratios compare favorably with those of the peer group banks and exceed minimum regulatory requirements 
the following table compares  as of december   the actual capital ratios of the bank to the capital ratios that the bank is required to meet under applicable banking regulations actual for capital adequacy purposes to be categorized as well capitalized total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to average assets forward looking information and uncertainties regarding future financial performance statements contained in this annual report that are not historical facts or that discuss our expectations or beliefs about our future financial performance including statements concerning business or financial trends are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of our actual financial results in future periods may differ  possibly materially  from those forecast  or identified as expected or anticipated  in this annual report due to a number of risks and uncertainties 
certain of those risks and uncertainties are discussed above in the section of the report entitled management s discussion and analysis of finance condition and results of operation 
in addition  included among the risks and uncertainties that could affect our future financial performance and condition are the following increased competition 
increased competition from other financial institutions  mutual funds and securities brokerage and investment banking firms that offer competitive loan and investment products could require us to reduce interest rates and loan fees in order to attract new loans or to increase interest rates that we offer on time deposits  either or both of which could  in turn  reduce our interest income or increase our interest expense  thereby reducing our net interest income and margins 
possible adverse changes in local economic conditions 
adverse changes in economic conditions  either national or local  could i reduce loan demand that could  in turn  reduce interest income and net interest margins  ii weaken the financial capability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations  resulting in increases in loan losses and require increases in reserves for possible loan losses through additional charges against income  and iii lead to reductions in real property values that  due to our reliance on real property to secure many of our loans  could make it more difficult for us to prevent losses from being incurred on non performing loans through the sale of such real properties 
possible adverse changes in federal reserve board monetary policies 
changes in national economic conditions  such as increases in inflation or declines in economic output often prompt changes in federal reserve board monetary policies that could increase the cost of funds to us or reduce yields on interest earning assets and  thereby  reduce net interest margins and net interest income 
as discussed above  in the past months the federal reserve board has lowered market rates of interest in an effort to stimulate the national economy 
those reductions caused our net interest margin to decline and could continue to do so in the future 
real estate mortgage loans 
approximately of the bank s loans are secured by deeds of trust or mortgages on real property 
although a significant portion of these loans were made to businesses for commercial purposes and the primary source of payment for these loans is the cash that they generate from their operations  a significant decline in real property values in southern california could result in a deterioration in some of those loans that would necessitate increases in the loan loss reserve and could result in loan write offs that would adversely affect our earnings 
changes in regulatory policies 
changes of federal and state bank regulatory policies  such as increases in capital requirements or in loan loss reserves  or changes in required asset liability ratios  could adversely affect earnings by reducing yields on earning assets or increasing operating costs 
effects of growth 
it is our intention to take advantage of opportunities to increase our business  either through acquisitions of other banks  the establishment of new banking offices or the offering of new products or services to our customers 
if we do acquire any other banks or open any additional banking offices or begin offering new products or services  we are likely to incur additional operating costs that may adversely affect our operating results  at least on an interim basis 
due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this annual report 
the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk market risk is the risk of loss to future earnings  to fair values of assets or to future cash flows that may result from changes in the price or value of financial instruments 
the value of a financial instrument may change as a result of changes in interest rates and other market conditions 
market risk is attributed to all market risk sensitive financial instruments  including loans and investment securities  deposits and borrowings 
we do not engage in trading activities or participate in foreign currency transactions for our own account 
accordingly  our exposure to market risk is primarily a function of our asset and liability management activities and of changes in market rates of interest that can cause or require increases in the rates we pay on deposits that may take effect more rapidly or may be greater than the increases in the interest rates we are able to charge on loans and the yields that we can realize on our investments 
the extent of that market risk depends on a number of variables  including the sensitivity to changes in market interest rates and the maturities of our interest earning assets and our deposits 
the table below sets forth information concerning the interest rate sensitivity of our consolidated assets and liabilities as of december  assets and liabilities are classified by the earliest possible repricing date or maturity  whichever comes first 
generally  where rate sensitive assets principally loans  investment securities and other interest earning assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities principally interest bearing deposits  the net interest margin will be positively impacted during periods of increasing interest rates and negatively impacted during periods of decreasing interest rates 
when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the net interest margin generally will be negatively affected during periods of increasing interest rates and positively affected during periods of decreasing interest rates

that model is used to assist management in evaluating  and in determining and adjusting strategies designed to reduce  our exposure to these market risks  which may include  for example  changing the mix of earning assets or interest bearing deposits
