item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations application of critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations when such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
in the ordinary course of business  we have made a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances 
the results form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that the following discussion addresses our most critical accounting policies  which are those that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require our most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
revenue recognition we record revenue on sales of boats  motors  trailers  and related watersport parts and accessories upon delivery to or acceptance by the customer at the closing of the transaction 
we record revenues from service operations at the time repair or service work is completed 
we refer customers to various financial institutions to assist the customers in obtaining financing for their boat purchase 
for each loan the financial institutions are able to fund as a result of the referral  we receive a fee 
revenue that we earn for financing referrals is recognized when the related boat sale is recognized 
the fee amount is generally based on the loan amount and the term 
generally  we must return a portion of the fee amount received if the customer repays the loan or defaults on the loan within a period of up to days from the initial loan date 
we record such refunds  which are not significant  in the month in which they occur 
revenues from insurance and extended service agreements are recorded at the time such agreements are executed which generally coincides with the date the boat  motor and trailer is delivered 
such revenues are not deferred and amortized over the life of the insurance or extended service agreement policies  because we sell such policies on behalf of third party vendors or administrators 
at the time of sale  we record income for insurance and extended service agreements net of the related fee that is paid to the third party vendors or administrators 
since our company s inception  we have incurred no additional costs related to insurance or extended service agreements beyond the fees paid to the third party vendors at the time of sale 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
accounts receivables consist primarily of amounts due from financial institutions upon sales contract funding  amounts due from manufacturers or vendors under rebate programs  amounts due from manufacturers or vendors under warranty programs and amounts due from customers for services 
the company routinely evaluates the collectibility of accounts receivable focusing on amounts due from manufacturers  vendors and customers 
if events occur and market conditions change  causing collectibility of outstanding accounts receivable to become unlikely  the company records an increase to its allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company evaluates the probability of collection of outstanding accounts receivable based several factors which include but are not limited to the following age of the outstanding accounts receivable  financial condition of the manufacturer  vendor or customer  and discussions or correspondence with the manufacturer  vendor or customer 
the company determines the allowance for doubtful accounts based upon both specific identification and a general allowance for accounts outstanding for a specified period of time 
inventory valuation our inventories consist of boats  motors  trailers and related watersport parts and accessories 
inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market 
cost for boats  motors and trailers is determined using the specific identification method 
cost for parts and accessories is determined using the first in  first out method 
if the carrying amount of our inventory exceeds its fair value  we write down our inventory to its fair value 
we utilize our historical experience and current sales trends as the basis for our lower of cost or market analysis 
changes in market conditions  lower than expected customer demand  closing of additional store locations and changing technology or features could result in additional obsolete inventory that is unsaleable or only saleable at reduced prices  which could require additional inventory reserve provisions 
such events and market conditions include but are not limited to the following deteriorating financial condition of the manufacturer resulting in discontinuance and lack of manufacturer s warranty for certain boats  motors or other products  introduction of new models or product lines by manufacturers resulting in less demand for previous models or product lines  company initiatives to promote unit sales and reduce inventory levels for new and or used inventory by reducing sales prices  and competing boat retailers in various markets in which the company operates may offer sales incentives such as price reductions 
goodwill and other intangibles we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas effective october  sfas provides that separable intangible assets that have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives and that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets will no longer be amortized but will be reviewed for impairment annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
with the adoption of the statement  we ceased amortization of goodwill as of october  the company operates as one reporting unit for goodwill impairment testing 
in accordance with sfas  we completed goodwill impairment tests as required 
the tests involved the use of estimates related to the fair market value of the business with which the goodwill is associated 
as a result of the transitional impairment test  which considered factors including the significant negative industry and economic trends impacting current operations and our market capitalization relative to our net book value  the company recorded a non cash  after tax charge of million as a cumulative effect of accounting change as of october  the non cash  after tax charge resulted in the elimination of the entire goodwill balance from our balance sheet 
income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  deferred income taxes are provided for temporary differences between the basis of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and for income tax return purposes 
the company routinely evaluates its recorded deferred tax assets to determine whether it is more likely than not that such deferred tax assets will be realized 
during the quarter ended september   the company determined that for deferred tax assets that could not be realized by carryback to prior tax years it was more likely than not that such deferred tax assets would not be realized and accordingly a full valuation allowance was necessary for these deferred tax assets

results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of our company and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
the discussion in this section of this report on form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in this section  those discussed in risk factors and those discussed elsewhere in this report on form k

fiscal year ended september  compared to the fiscal year ended september net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended september  were million  a decrease of approximately million or from the net sales of million for the fiscal year ended september  comparable store sales declined by stores in base for the fiscal year ended september  compared to a decrease of stores in base during the prior fiscal year 
management believes the decline in net sales and the decrease in comparable store sales was related to various factors including  but not limited to  fewer stores in operation  erratic levels of consumer confidence and employment uncertainty  combined with persistent weak economic and industry conditions 
the decrease in net sales for the year ended september  included million in reduced sales as a result of the impact of fewer stores in operation versus 
included within net sales is revenue that we earn related to f i products 
the company  through relationships with various national and local lenders  is able to place financing for its customers boating purchases 
these lenders allow us to sell the loan at a rate higher than a minimum rate established by each such lender  and the we earn fees based on the percentage increase in the loan rate over the lender s minimum rate the rate spread 
we sell these loans without recourse  except that in certain instances we must return the fees earned if the customer repays the loan or defaults in the first days 
we also sell  as a broker  certain types of insurance property casualty  credit life  disability and extended service contracts 
we may also sell these products at amounts over a minimum established cost and earn income based upon the profit over the minimum established cost 
net sales attributable to f i products decreased by to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  f i income as a percentage of net sales also decreased to from in fiscal due primarily to i lower overall net sales  ii reductions in overall yields paid by lenders for originating customer finance contracts  iii competitive pressures on finance rates which resulted in lower net spreads achieved in the placement of customer financing and iv with regard to our store locations in arkansas  certain caps or limits on interest rates allowed to be charged by lenders in arkansas 
decreases in the percentage of customers buying these products which is referred to as sell through  particularly by purchasers of the larger  more expensive boats and reduced customer demand for certain insurance products have also been limiting factors 
based on these circumstances and recent attempts by certain manufacturers to enhance certain manufacturer warranty products  we believe that net sales of f i products may continue to decline somewhat for an indefinite period  although we believe that they will ultimately stabilize 
gross profit 
for the fiscal year ended  september   gross profit decreased to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
gross profit  as a percent of sales  decreased to from during the same period 
the decrease in total gross profit  both in actual dollars and as a percent of net sales  was primarily related to i the decline in net sales during the periods and ii the inventory valuation allowance required to reduce the basis in certain aged or discontinued inventories to reflect obsolescence and current market values 
the increase in inventory valuation allowance was approximately  of which a substantial portion was recorded during the quarter ended september  as we focused on initiatives to reduce both levels of inventory and outstanding indebtedness 
inventory values have been impacted by the declines in sales and the overall softness of sales in the marine industry 
also  in an effort to stimulate sales  we offered certain sales incentives and participated in manufacturer sponsored rebate programs in an effort i to reduce certain non current inventory levels and ii to stimulate sales in response to weak economic and industry conditions 
we believe that we may continue to experience erratic levels of overall gross profit margins during the fiscal year resulting  in part  to i introductions of certain new travis edition product lines and ii continued emphasis on incentives and marketing promotions to stimulate sales of both current and non current discontinued inventory models 
while these programs have impacted gross profit  we have been successful in reducing overall inventory levels 
our inventory levels were approximately million as of september  versus million as of september  see liquidity and capital resources and risk factors we have inventory from defunct manufacturers and discontinued inventory 
the decline in net sales attributable to f i products has also impacted the gross profit margin 
net sales of these f i products  which have a significant impact on the gross profit margin  contributed million  or  of total gross profit in fiscal  as compared to million  or  of total gross profit for fiscal net sales attributable to f i products are reported on a net basis and therefore all of such sales contribute directly to our gross profit 
the costs associated with the sale of f i products are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
during the prior fiscal year  we also had expenses of approximately  related to closing of the store locations in miami  florida and huntsville  alabama 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percent of net sales  were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses  in actual dollars  for the fiscal year ended september  versus the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to the reduction in wages  commissions  travel entertainment expenses and the overall decline in net sales 
we have managed headcount primarily through attrition and selective position consolidation 
the reduction in overall expenses was offset by increases in certain expenses  primarily insurance expense and a substantial increase in bad debt expense related to reserves on certain accounts receivable 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for the fiscal year ended september  versus the prior year was partially offset by an increase bad debt expense of approximately million of which a substantial portion was recorded during the quarter ended september  despite our enhanced collection efforts  we continue to experience delays in collections from manufacturers  vendors and customers due to both deteriorating financial condition of these parties and a general economic downturn in the marine industry 
although we continue to pursue collection of these outstanding accounts receivable  we believed an increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts was warranted to reflect our most recent assessment of the probability of collection 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million for the prior fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization expenses  as a percent of net sales  decreased to in fiscal from for the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in depreciation and amortization expenses  both in actual dollars and as a percent of net sales  was primarily attributable to our adoption of sfas effective on october  pursuant to the adoption  we discontinued the amortization of goodwill 
accordingly  our amortization expense was  and  in fiscal year and  respectively 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
interest expense decreased to from of net sales in fiscal years and fiscal  respectively 
the decreased interest expense  both in actual dollars and as a percent of net sales  was primarily the result of significantly lower balances on our inventory based lines of credit due to the significant reductions in the levels of inventory held 
we have successfully reduced inventory levels to reflect sales trends and as a result of our prior implementation of a master business plan that requires pre approved purchase orders for all inventory purchases 
interest expense also benefited from the decreases in our variable borrowing rates relative to the same period of the prior year resulting from the numerous reductions in the prime rate during the calendar year 
we anticipate continuing to utilize significant amounts of third party financing sources to support our inventories and other assets 
accordingly  we are subject to the impact of increases in interest expenses and other costs associated with such borrowings 
see risk factors our substantial indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
income taxes 
our effective income tax benefit rate for the year ended september  applicable to the operating loss  was reduced by the creation of a valuation allowance in the approximate amount of million  that was recorded against our deferred income tax assets during the fourth quarter of fiscal the valuation allowances were recorded due to uncertainties surrounding the recovery of income tax assets against taxable income in future periods 
beginning with the quarter ending march   we do not anticipate recognizing income tax benefits on our books from future losses  due to uncertainties associated with the utilization of the operating loss carry forwards in future periods 
we have pledged  as collateral  the amount expected to be received from our federal tax return against a million advance type note we entered into during january accordingly  amounts received from the projected tax return will be used by the company for repayment of this loan 
see risk factors financing arrangements and income tax refunds pledged as security 
net loss 
for the fiscal year ended september   the company  after preferred stock dividends of  reported a net loss prior to the effect of the cumulative accounting change and the extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt of million per basic and diluted share compared to a net loss of million 
per basic and diluted share for the prior fiscal year 
see note basis of presentation in the consolidated audited financial statements of the company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
inclusive of the impact of the cumulative effect of accounting change and the extraordinary loss on extinguishment of debt  we reported a net loss of approximately million per basic and diluted share for the fiscal year 
the net loss from the cumulative effect of accounting change is from our adoption of sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets as of october  the application of the transition provisions of this new accounting standard required us to take a non cash  non recurring  after tax charge of approximately million effective as of october the charge eliminated our goodwill accounts 
fiscal year ended september  compared to the fiscal year ended september net sales 
net sales for the fiscal year ended september  were million  a decrease of approximately million or from the net sales of million for the fiscal year ended september  comparable store sales declined by stores in base for the fiscal year ended september  compared to a decrease of stores in base during the prior fiscal year 
management believes the decline in net sales and the decrease in comparable store sales was related to various factors including  but not limited to  erratic levels of consumer confidence  persistent weak economic and industry conditions and high fuel prices 
in certain markets these factors have been exaggerated by weather conditions related to the severe impact of tropical storm allison along the texas and louisiana coastlines 
net sales were also impacted by i a significant percentage decline in net sales specifically during the month of september and ii the closing of store locations in miami  florida and huntsville  alabama during our fourth quarter of fiscal prior to their closing  the miami and huntsville store locations had combined sales of approximately million during fiscal compared to net sales of million in the prior fiscal year 
in reviewing these store locations  we determined that each store had a sales overlap with certain other travis boating center locations and that we could likely more cost effectively serve our customers through such alternate store locations 
included within net sales is revenue that we earn related to f i products 
the company  through relationships with various national and local lenders  is able to place financing for its customers boating purchases 
these lenders allow us to sell the loan at a rate higher than a minimum rate established by each such lender  and we earn fees based on the percentage increase in the loan rate over the lender s minimum rate the rate spread 
we sell these loans without recourse  except that in certain instances we must return the fees earned if the customer repays the loan or defaults in the first days 
we also sell as a broker  certain types of insurance property casualty  credit life  disability and extended service contracts 
we also sell these products at amounts over a minimum established cost and earn income based upon the profit over the minimum established cost 
net sales attributable to f i products decreased by to approximately million in fiscal from million in fiscal in fiscal  f i income as a percentage of net sales also decreased to from in fiscal due primarily to i lower overall net sales  ii reductions in overall yields paid by lenders for originating customer finance contracts  iii competitive pressures on finance rates which resulted in lower net spreads achieved in the placement of customer financing and iv with regard to our store locations in arkansas  certain caps or limits on interest rates allowed to be charged by lenders in arkansas 
decreases in the percentage of customers buying these products which is referred to as sell through  particularly by purchasers of the larger  more expensive boats and reduced customer demand for certain insurance products have also been limiting factors 
based on these circumstances and recent attempts by certain manufacturers to enhance certain manufacturer warranty products  we believe that net sales of f i products may continue to decline prior to ultimately stabilizing 
gross profit 
for the fiscal year ended  september   gross profit decreased to million from million in the prior fiscal year 
gross profit  as a percent of sales  decreased to from during the same period 
the decrease in gross profit  both in actual dollars and as a percent of net sales  was primarily related to the company and certain of our manufacturers offering additional incentives and rebates on various models of boats and outboard engines 
the manufacturer incentives and rebates were developed by the manufacturers as part of an effort to stimulate sales due to overall weak industry sales performance 
additionally  we developed other incentives as part of its ongoing inventory reduction plan implemented previously during the summer of the prior fiscal year 
while these programs have impacted gross profit  we were successful in reducing overall inventory levels 
our inventory levels were approximately million as of september  versus million as of september  see liquidity and capital resources 
the decline in net sales attributable to f i products has also impacted the gross profit margin 
net sales of these f i products  which have a significant impact on the gross profit margin  contributed million  or  of total gross profit in fiscal  as compared to million  or  of total gross profit for fiscal net sales attributable to f i products are reported on a net basis and therefore all of such sales contribute directly to our gross profit 
the costs associated with the sale of f i products are included in selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
during fiscal we also had expenses of approximately  related to closing of the store locations in miami  florida and huntsville  alabama 
selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percent of net sales  were in fiscal  compared to in fiscal the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses in actual dollars for the fiscal year ended september  versus the prior fiscal year was primarily attributable to the reduction in wages  commissions and travel entertainment expenses 
we have reduced headcount primarily through attrition and selective position consolidation 
the reduction in overall expenses was offset by increases in certain expenses such as utilities  insurance  fuel costs  rent lease expense and bad debt expense related to reserves on certain accounts receivable 
depreciation and amortization expenses 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased to million in fiscal from million for the prior fiscal year 
depreciation and amortization expenses  as a percent of net sales  increased to in fiscal from for prior fiscal year 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expenses  both in actual dollars and as a percent of net sales  was primarily attributable to the depreciation expenses of our recently completed superstore location in san antonio  texas  substantial renovations to the clearwater  florida store location and other improvements to our asset infrastructure 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to million in fiscal from million in the prior fiscal year 
however  interest expense increased to from of net sales in fiscal years and fiscal  respectively  primarily as a result of the overall decline in net sales for the fiscal year 
interest expense in actual dollars  was positively impacted by decreases in our short term borrowing rates and inventory debt levels relative to the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in interest expense was somewhat offset by the incremental interest expense incurred on the additional long term debt related to our new superstore in san antonio  texas and other real estate holdings 
we anticipate continuing to utilize significant amounts of third party financing sources to support our inventories and other assets 
accordingly  we are subject to the impact of increases in interest expenses and other costs associated with such borrowings 
see risk factors our substantial indebtedness could restrict our operations and make us more vulnerable to adverse economic conditions and quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk 
net income loss 
the company posted a net loss of approximately million for fiscal versus a net income of approximately  in fiscal primarily due to the above described declines in net sales and total gross profit margins 
see quarterly data and seasonality 
the following table sets forth certain unaudited quarterly financial data for each of our last eight quarters and such data expressed as a percentage of our net sales for the respective quarters

our strongest sales period begins in january  because many boat and recreation shows are held in that month 
strong sales demand continues from january through the summer months 
of our average annual net sales over the last three fiscal years  over occurred in the quarter ending march and over occurred in the quarter ending june with the exception of our store locations in florida  our sales are generally significantly lower in the quarter ending december because the overall sales levels in most stores in the december quarter are much less than in the months with warmer weather  we generally have a substantial operating loss in the quarter ending december because of the difference in sales levels in the warm spring and summer months  versus the cold fall and winter months  if our sales in the months of january through june are weak as a result of lackluster consumer demand  timing of boat shows  bad weather or lack of inventory we will likely suffer significant operating losses 
our business is also significantly affected by weather patterns 
weather conditions that are unseasonable or unusual may adversely affect our results of operations 
for example  drought conditions or merely reduced rainfall levels  as well as excessive rain  may affect our sale of boating packages and related products and accessories 
see risk factors we depend on strong sales in the first half of the year and our sales depend on good weather 
quarterly results may fluctuate due to many factors 
some of these factors include  weather conditions  timing of special events such as boat shows  availability of product and the opening or closing of store locations 
accordingly  the results for any quarterly period may not be indicative of the expected results for any other quarterly period 
the results for the quarters ended september  and were negatively impacted by certain events including the expenses related to establishment of reserve allowances on certain inventories  deferred tax assets and accounts receivable 
liquidity and capital resources contractual commitments and commercial commitments the following table sets forth a summary of our material contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of september  year ended september  line of long term convertible operating total s credit debt notes leases thereafter  total      our inventory borrowing agreements  which originated in january  mature in april includes million in real estate loans with a single lender which have been re classified as current for financial reporting since we are out of compliance with certain financial loan covenants and the loans are subject to demand for repayment prior to their originally scheduled dates of maturity 
our short term cash needs are primarily for working capital to support operations  including inventory requirements  off season liquidity and store infrastructure 
these short term cash needs have historically been financed with cash from operations and further supplemented by borrowings under our floor plan and revolving credit lines collectively the borrowing agreements 
during the fiscal year ended september   we also increased working capital by the issuance of million in subordinated convertible notes of which million was repaid in june of and million from the issuance of  shares of series a preferred stock 
at september   we had approximately million in cash  million in accounts receivable primarily contracts in transit from sales  manufacturer rebates receivable and other amounts due from manufacturers and million in inventories 
contracts in transit are amounts receivable from a customer or a customer s financial institution related to that customer s purchase of a boat 
these asset balances were offset by approximately million of accounts payable and accrued liabilities  million outstanding under our borrowing agreements and million in short term indebtedness including i current maturities of notes payable of  ii a real estate loan in the amount of  with a balloon payment due at maturity in january and iii million in real estate loans with a single lender which have been re classified as current for financial reporting since we are out of compliance with certain financial loan covenants and the loans are subject to demand for repayment prior to their originally scheduled dates of maturity 
see risk factors we are out of compliance on certain loan agreements and have been out of compliance on others 
as of september   the aggregate maximum borrowing limits under our borrowing agreements was million  respectively see note subsequent events in the consolidated audited financial statements of the company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
at september   we had working capital of approximately million 
working capital  as of that date  was reduced by our net loss and the aforementioned million  in short term indebtedness classified as a current liability 
in fiscal  operating activities provided cash flows of million due primarily to the decrease of million in inventories as a result of our continued emphasis on inventory reduction strategies and the collection of the income taxes recoverable 
these amounts were offset partially by the net loss of million  the cumulative effect of accounting change and a million decrease in accounts payable 
in fiscal  operating activities provided cash flows of million due primarily to the decrease of million in inventories as a result of our inventory reduction strategies and net increases in accounts payable and the collection of the income taxes recoverable 
these amounts were offset partially by the net loss of million  decreases in accrued liabilities and prepaid expenses 
investing activities in fiscal utilized cash flows of million due primarily to the purchase and replacement of assets used in operations of the store locations 
these activities were primarily funded through our borrowing agreements and internal cash flows 
financing activities in fiscal provided cash flows of  primarily from the net proceeds of the issuance of series a preferred stock and convertible subordinated notes  offset by the repayment of amounts outstanding under our borrowing agreements and under a million convertible subordinated note 
the repayments under the borrowing agreements were generally from the proceeds of our net reduction in overall inventory levels during the period 
we finance substantially all of our inventory and working capital requirements pursuant to borrowing agreements entered into in january with two commercial finance companies transamerica commercial finance corporation tcfc and ge commercial distribution finance corporation ge formerly known as deutsche financial services corporation dfs 
the agreements  which currently have maturity dates of april  have been amended numerous times see note subsequent events in the consolidated audited financial statements of the company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
the agreements contain substantially similar terms and financial ratio based covenant requirements 
the maximum aggregate borrowing availability as of september  was limited to a maximum credit limit of million at various prime based or libor based interest rates varying from to at september  
borrowings under the agreements are pursuant to a borrowing base  or specific floor plan  advancing formula and are used primarily to finance inventory purchases and for general working capital requirements 
substantially all inventory  accounts receivable  furniture  fixtures  equipment  real estate junior liens and intangible assets collateralize these borrowing agreements 
the terms of the borrowing agreements also provide for i fees for administrative monitoring  ii fees for unused portions of available credit  and iii pre payment fees in the event of our termination of such floor plans prior to their stated original maturity dates 
the borrowing agreements also include restrictive loan agreements containing various loan covenants and borrowing restrictions  including minimum financial ratios governing net worth  current assets  debt to worth percentages and cash flow coverage requirements based upon interest expense and monthly principal and interest payments on debts 
acquisitions  the payment of common stock dividends or repurchases of our common stock are also substantially limited without prior consent 
effective with the results of operations for the three and twelve months ended september   we were in violation of several financial ratio covenants and  subsequent to such time  became in violation of payment requirements for sold and matured inventory 
effective on december th and st   we entered into amended and restated borrowing agreements the amended agreements with our senior inventory lenders  tcfc and ge  formerly dfs 
the amended agreements included  but were not limited to  the following components extension of the maturity date of the respective borrowing agreements from january  to april  waiver of certain financial  reporting and payment defaults as of the date of the amended agreements 
the financial default waivers included the re establishment and modification of new financial ratio levels based upon our current and anticipated financial performance through the maturity date of april  the waived reporting requirements provided us time to finalize our audit report and report on form k for the fiscal year ended september  the waived payment defaults were the result of our failure to repay certain amounts scheduled to be paid according to the terms of the borrowing agreements  including the timely payment of amounts for sold inventory and scheduled amounts for certain matured inventory 
the waivers of the payment defaults were accommodated by the lenders revising the terms under the amended agreements to temporarily advance certain funds to us on inventory assets primarily certain new and used aged inventories that previously were not eligible assets upon which we could borrow funds 
repayment of the amounts resulting from the payment default is required upon the earlier of  i the sale of such inventory providing the basis for the temporary advance  ii the receipt by the company of its projected calendar year federal income tax refund  or iii april  an intercreditor agreement by and among tcfc  ge and tmrc  llp the owner of the company s outstanding shares of series a preferred stock to each  individually  provide the company up to an additional  of conditional funding collectively million 
the requirement of any party to advance funds under this agreement is at each participant s sole and individual discretion 
accordingly  the company is not guaranteed any advances  or to the extent advances are made  any future or additional advances 
funds may only be used for the general working capital expenses of the company 
as of january   the company has received  from each of tcfc  ge and tmrc  llp collectively  as advances pursuant to this agreement 
see risk factors operating losses and reduced financing have jeopardized our cash flow and note subsequent events in the consolidated audited financial statements of the company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
we pursued this transaction and financing because of our belief that current and anticipated cash needs through april  exceed amounts otherwise available to be borrowed under our current credit facilities with tcfc and ge 
this projected shortfall is influenced in part by our seasonal trends which include historically low sales levels during the october through december periods 
the seasonal lull normally experienced at the end of a calendar year was compounded at the end of by continued economic uncertainty  weak industry sales trends  and certain revised borrowing terms which have had the effect of reducing our borrowing base during this period 
based upon management s initial fiscal operating plan  including the i sale leaseback or refinancing of certain assets  ii closing additional store locations  iii further reducing staff levels and  if necessary  benefits  iv reducing expenses or renegotiating fixed payments plus the availability under its borrowing agreements and the additional million in conditional funding  management believes that there is potential liquidity to fund our operations and to make required principal payments under the two borrowing agreements and other outstanding debt through the maturity date of april  however  material shortfalls or variances from anticipated performance or the timing of certain expenses or revenues could require us to seek further amendment to the amended borrowing agreements or alternate sources of financing 
see risk factors operating losses and reduced financing have jeopardized our cash flow  risk factors change of control  risk factors financing arrangements and note basis of presentation in the consolidated audited financial statements of the company and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report on form k 
during the period prior to the expiration of our inventory borrowing agreements on april   we will be revising our business plan to support our required financing arrangements for the remainder of fiscal and beyond either with our current lenders or from other sources 
there is no assurance that renewal of the borrowing agreements will be possible  that further amendments are available to the company or that we will be successful in obtaining adequate financing arrangements from these or alternate sources 
as of the date of this report on form k  management believes the company to be in compliance with all other terms and conditions of its borrowing agreements and all proposed terms and conditions established pursuant to the aforementioned waivers except as follows we are currently not in compliance with financial covenants of a loan agreement on certain real estate loans with hibernia national bank hibernia requiring i minimum cash flow and ii minimum tangible net worth 
the loan agreement requires minimum cash flow as defined in the agreement must exceed to based upon the company s financial results as of september  the company s ratio is
