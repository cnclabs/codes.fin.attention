the company believes it will be able to obtain such expanded credit line  if required  on generally the same terms as the existing credit line 
however the company may be required to seek additional sources of funding  if necessary 
inflation the company has no long term  fixed price supply contracts 
although the average set of dies takes approximately ten months from inception to shipment  any significant direct material costs are incurred at the beginning of the die manufacturing process 
historically  the company has been able to reflect increases in the prices of labor and material in its selling prices  however under current industry pricing pressures  the company is unsure if this will continue to be the case in the future
