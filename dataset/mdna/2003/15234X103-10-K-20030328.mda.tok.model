on april   we acquired mindlever 
com  inc  a north carolina corporation and a provider of management systems for learning content  for million in cash and  shares of common stock valued at approximately million  plus acquisition costs of approximately  for a total purchase price of approximately million 
as a result of the acquisition  mindlever became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the results of operations of mindlever have been included in our results of operations from the date of acquisition 
subsequently  during the quarter ended december   we recorded a charge of million classified as an impairment charge in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  to write down the remaining goodwill to its implied fair value of zero 

table of contents we sell our products and services primarily through a direct sales force and through relationships with indirect channel partners  including value added resellers and learning technology providers 
we have established direct sales and service operations for europe  with headquarters in the united kingdom  and for australia  based in sydney 
in addition  we have value added resellers throughout north america  europe  the middle east  asia  brazil  south africa and central america 
revenues from sales outside of the united states were   and  or  and of total revenues  for  and  respectively 
since  we have invested in the infrastructure necessary to expand our global operations  including the formation and staffing of our european subsidiaries and our asian and australian operations 
we expect to continue to invest in our international operations as we expand our international indirect channels and our asp service operations abroad to increase worldwide market share 
while weak global economic conditions for enterprise software has negatively impacted international revenues in  we continue to anticipate that revenues derived from outside the united states will increase both in terms of percentage of revenues and absolute dollars in the future 
our cost of license revenues includes royalties due to third parties for technology included in our products  as well as the cost of product documentation  media used to deliver our products  and fulfillment 
amortization of acquired developed technology represents the amortization  over a three year period  of the valuation of the developed technology and know how acquired in connection with our april acquisition of mindlever 
our cost of service revenues includes salaries and related expenses for our consulting  education  technical support and hosted and asp services organizations  an overhead allocation consisting primarily of that portion of our facilities  communications and depreciation expenses that is attributable to providing our services  and direct costs related to our hosting and asp service offerings 
our operating expenses are classified into seven general categories sales and marketing  product development  general and administrative  compensation charge for issuance of stock options  impairment of goodwill  merger transaction costs and restructuring charges 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for sales and marketing personnel and costs associated with marketing programs  including trade shows  user group meetings and seminars  advertising  public relations activities and new product launches 
product development expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and benefits  fees for outside consultants and other related costs associated with the development of new products and the enhancement of existing products  amortization of costs of third party source code purchased  costs associated with quality assurance  testing and documentation and third party localization costs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for executive  financial  administrative and information technology personnel  as well as costs for auditing and accounting  legal  investor relations  liability insurance and other expenses associated with being a public company 
compensation charge for issuance of stock options represents the amortization  over the vesting period  of the difference between the exercise price of options granted to employees in and and the deemed fair market value of the options for financial reporting purposes 
impairment of goodwill represents the write down of the remaining goodwill related to the mindlever transaction to its implied fair value of zero 
merger transaction costs represent legal and investment advisor costs that were incurred related to the proposed merger between centra and smartforce plc 
the proposed merger was terminated as of april  restructuring charges represent the charges that were incurred related to a reduction in the company s workforce in april 
table of contents in the development of new products and enhancements of existing products  the technological feasibility of the software is not established until substantially all product development is complete 
historically  our software development costs eligible for capitalization have been insignificant and all costs related to internal product development have been expensed as incurred 
our previously outstanding series a and series b preferred stock had participation rights that allowed holders to receive a premium equal to of their original investment upon redemption  liquidation or automatic conversion of the preferred stock into common stock 
for financial reporting purposes  we discounted the value of series a and series b preferred stock by the value of these participation rights 
prior to february  we had been increasing the carrying value of the series a and series b preferred stock for the liquidation premium and participation discount through charges to stockholders deficit over the redemption period 
this increase is also reflected in the accretion of discount on preferred stock in our consolidated statements of operations 
upon the automatic conversion of the series a and series b preferred stock into common stock in february   in unamortized liquidation premium and participation discount on the series a and series b preferred stock was accreted 
we have experienced substantial losses in each fiscal period since our inception 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
these losses and our accumulated deficit have resulted from our lack of substantial revenues  as well as the significant costs incurred in the development of our products and services and in the establishment of our hosted and asp services infrastructure which have been only partially offset by our revenues to date 
we expect to maintain the same level or slightly increase our expenditures in all areas in order to execute our business plan to expand our ecosystem of alliance and channel partners  to increase our telesales organization and to further develop and improve our products and services and re align our marketing programs to address the real time enterprise collaboration market 
although we have experienced revenue growth in the past  revenues for declined from the previous year and our net loss continued 
we may not be able to increase our revenues again or attain profitability and  if we do achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain profitability for any future periods 
accordingly  we expect to incur additional losses during we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical operating results may not be meaningful  and you should not rely upon them as an indication of our future financial performance 
see factors that could affect future results  in item critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition and the valuation of long lived assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
note to the consolidated financial statements contains a discussion of our significant accounting policies 
management believes that the following critical accounting policies most significantly affect the portrayal of our financial condition and require management s most difficult and subjective judgments revenue recognition the recognition of revenue is a key component of our results of operations and the timing of when revenue is recognized determines the timing of certain costs and expenses  such as royalties and commissions 
in measuring revenues  the company follows the specific guidelines of the american institute of certified public 
table of contents accountants statement of position sop software revenue recognition  and sop modification of sop  software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  and related authoritative literature 
we derive substantially all of our revenues from the sale of software licenses  post contract support maintenance  asp services and other services 
maintenance includes telephone support  error correction or bug fixes and rights to upgrades and enhancements on a when and if available basis 
other services include training  education  basic implementation assistance to meet specific customer needs  and the hosting of our products 
we execute contracts that govern the terms and conditions of each software license  maintenance and support and other services arrangements 
these contracts may be elements in a multiple element arrangement 
revenue under multiple element arrangements  which may include several different software products and services sold together  is allocated to each element based on the residual method in accordance with sop as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
management analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  creditworthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could affect the timing and amount of revenue and cost recognized and thus affect our results of operations and financial condition 
we generally license our software products on a perpetual basis 
we apply the provisions of sop  as amended by sop to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
this policy is applicable to all sales to end users 
license sales to distributors or to a value added reseller is recognized when an end user customer has been identified and all other revenue recognition criteria above have been met 
advance payments are recorded as deferred revenue until the products are shipped  services are delivered or obligations are met 
we do not offer a right of return on our products 
for all sales  we use either a binding purchase order or a signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for arrangements with multiple elements for example  the sale of a product license in connection with the sale of maintenance and support  training and consulting services to be delivered separately from the licenses  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
we defer revenue from the arrangement that is equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements and we recognize the remaining amount at the time of the sale 
we base our estimates of fair values for ongoing maintenance and support obligations on separate sales of renewals of maintenance contracts 
we base our fair value of services  such as training or consulting  on separate sales of these services to other customers 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
billings to customers are generally due within to days 
however  we have offered extended payment terms greater than days but equal to or less than days to certain customers  for which license revenue is recognized upon shipment 
these customers are well capitalized and typically have entered into larger scale license arrangements with us 
we believe that we have sufficient history of collecting all amounts within the stated terms under these types of arrangements to conclude that the fee is fixed or determinable at the time license revenue is recognized 
in addition  we assess whether collection is probable or not based on the creditworthiness of the customer 
initial creditworthiness is assessed through dun bradstreet  similar credit rating agencies or the customer s sec filings 
creditworthiness for follow on transactions is assessed through a review of the transaction history with the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
we recognize revenues for maintenance and support and for hosting services ratably on a straight line basis over the term of the respective periods during which the maintenance and support or hosting services are provided 
revenues from asp start up fees are recognized over the contract period or estimated life of the asp 
table of contents relationship  whichever is greater 
revenues related to asp services are recognized on a straight line basis over the period during which the asp services are provided  or on an as used basis if so defined in the contract 
revenues from consulting and training services  because such services are not considered essential to the functionality of the products they do not alter the product capabilities or require specialized skills and may be performed by the customer or other vendor  are recognized either as the services are performed  ratably over a subscription period or upon completing a project milestone if defined in the agreement 
also  in instances where we host a customer s purchased software on our server and network  we also provide the customer a copy of the software in addition to the copy we keep on our server  and recognize the license revenue as discussed above in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  application of sop to arrangements that include the rights to use software stored on another entity s hardware 
we record as deferred revenues any billed amounts due from customers in excess of revenues recognized 
deferred revenues consist principally of maintenance and support  asp and hosting services  and consulting and education services 
accounts receivable valuation and reserves we maintain allowances for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and on our history of write offs of accounts receivable 
while we believe the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances would be required and bad debt expense would increase by the amount we increased the allowances 
in addition to the allowance for uncollectible amounts  we also provide an allowance for sales returns based on historical return rates 
if we were to experience return rates exceeding those provided for  an additional allowance for sales returns would be required  our total revenues would be reduced and our loss increased by the amount we increased the allowances 
short term investments investments  which primarily consist of debt securities  are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 the company has classified its investment portfolio as held to maturity 
held to maturity securities are debt securities that the company intends to hold to maturity and are recorded at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value 
as of december   all of the company s investments have been classified as held to maturity 
in january  we liquidated  prior to maturity  investments in certain short term debt obligations of california based utilities when their ratings dropped to below investment grade 
this resulted in a realized loss of approximately  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill effective january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually in lieu of being amortized 
furthermore  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
an impairment loss shall be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
impairment losses shall be recognized in operations 
the acquisition of mindlever on april  was accounted for in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
we applied the transition provisions of sfas no 
and sfas no 
during the first quarter of without a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
under sfas no 
 we no longer amortize goodwill but instead review it at least annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
we adopted our fourth quarter for our annual impairment analysis 

table of contents accordingly  we obtained an independent valuation during the fourth quarter of for the purpose of conducting this impairment assessment 
we utilized a two step approach to test for impairment 
first we tested for indicators of impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of the company with its carrying value 
since the company operates as a single reporting unit  we determined that a combination of the market value of the company and the net present value of the cash flows estimated to be produced by our assets over their useful lives represents an approximation of the company s fair value as of december furthermore  we determined that under this method  the fair value of the company as of our december annual measurement was less than its carrying value and therefore  an indication of impairment existed 
the second step was to measure the amount of the impairment of goodwill 
in this second step  we calculated the implied fair value of the goodwill by allocating the fair value among all of our assets and liabilities as if the company had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess  if any  of the fair value over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities would be the implied fair value of goodwill 
we allocated the entire fair value of the company among our assets and liabilities other than goodwill and  therefore  concluded that the implied fair value of goodwill was zero 
accordingly  we recorded a charge of million  or the entire carrying amount of goodwill  in the fourth quarter of we classified this charge as an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations 
we review the valuation of long lived assets  including property and equipment and acquired capitalized software costs  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
under these provisions  we are required to assess the recoverability of long lived assets and acquired capitalized software costs whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable at the end of each reporting period 
factors we consider important that could trigger an impairment review of long lived assets include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 when we determine that the carrying value of applicable long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators  we then evaluate whether the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
if so  we would then measure an impairment as the amount by which the carrying amount of the particular long lived asset or group exceeds its fair value 
we would determine the fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model or through an independent appraisal of individual assets 
in accordance with sfas no 
 when we determine that the carrying value of our acquired capitalized software costs may not be recoverable  we evaluate whether the unamortized cost exceeds the expected future net realizable value of the products 
if the unamortized costs exceed the expected future net realizable value of the products  the excess amount is written off 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could impact the value of the asset being evaluated 
we adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of fiscal year  without a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
accounting for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements requires us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states which may be subject to certain 
table of contents risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process involves our estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
we have recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize any of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses and tax credits carried forward before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by the jurisdictions in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation centra s stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to contribute to the success of the company by attracting  retaining and motivating talented employees and to align employee interests with the interests of our existing stockholders 
stock options are granted to employees when they first join the company and typically on an annual basis thereafter 
stock options are also granted when there is a significant change in an employee s responsibilities and  occasionally  to achieve equity within a peer group 
the compensation committee of the board of directors may  however  grant additional options to executive officers and key employees for other reasons 
under the stock option plans  the participants may be granted options to purchase shares of centra stock and substantially all of our employees and directors participate in at least one of our plans 
options issued under these plans generally are granted at fair market value at the date of grant  become exercisable at varying rates  generally over four years and expire years from the date of grant 
all stock option grants are reviewed and approved by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
all members of the compensation committee are independent directors  as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq national market 
see the report of the compensation committee in our proxy statement for further information regarding the policies and procedures of centra and the compensation committee regarding the granting of stock options

see note to consolidated statements of operations 
includes the impact of the acquisition of mindlever from the date of acquisition in april comparison of and revenues 
total revenues decreased by million  or  to million for  from million for the decrease was attributable to a significant decrease in software license revenue  partially offset by increased service revenues 
overall  we believe that revenue growth will be modest over the next couple of quarters as constraints on technology spending continue 
however  we believe that the continued expansion of our distribution channels  including telesales  and with the addition of new value added resellers and integrated technology solution providers for north america  along with the optimization of our direct field sales force  will help to drive new account acquisition and increased revenues in the future 

table of contents software license revenues decreased by million  or  to million for  from million for the decrease resulted from a decline in the average transaction value  fewer software license transactions and  to a lesser extent  a shift in customer buying patterns towards our asp service offerings in lieu of buying perpetual licenses 
external factors contributing to the decrease included a weak business economic environment in all geographic areas and reduced technology spending  which resulted in orders  particularly to new customers  being delayed  reduced in size or shifted to our asp service offerings instead of licenses 
the number of new customer software license transactions decreased from in to in and the average software license size of new customer transactions decreased from approximately  in to approximately  in the number of follow on software license sales also decreased from in to in and the average size of follow on software license sales decreased from approximately  in to approximately  in although we believe some of these factors may be temporary  we cannot predict when  or if  these trends might slow or reverse in future periods 
services revenues increased by million  or  to million for  from million for the increase primarily came from an increase in the number of renewals of annual maintenance and support contracts  an increase in orders of our asp service offerings  and an increase in consulting and  to a lesser extent  hosting services 
during  orders for our asp service offerings had increased by over  as the result of customers preferring to purchase an asp service because of the lower initial purchase cost and their lack of the necessary it infrastructure or resources to deploy licenses onsite 
in addition  the growth in orders for our asp service offerings in  was partly attributable to increased productivity of our telesales organization due to increased headcount and an increased focus on selling our asp service 
we expect services revenues to increase in future periods 
the rate of the increase may vary from period to period  depending primarily upon the number of new asp customers and the value of new maintenance contracts added 
any increases may be offset by non renewals of any maintenance contracts or asp subscriptions 
services revenues represented of total revenues for compared to of total revenues for cost of license revenues 
cost of license revenues decreased by  or  to  for  from  for cost of license revenues was of license revenues for and of license revenues for the decrease in dollar amount was primarily attributable to a lower volume of license sales in  partially offset by an increase in certain annual royalty costs over the prior year 
since a significant portion of our license costs represent royalties charged on a per unit rate of product sold  we expect that cost of license revenues will vary in the future depending upon the unit volume of products sold 
however  we believe the overall cost of license revenues per unit will decline in the short term as the next version of our products to be released  expected to be available in june  will exclude some third party technologies  subject to royalties  that we include in the current version of our products 
amortization of acquired developed technology 
in connection with our acquisition of mindlever in april  we allocated approximately million to acquired developed technology which is being amortized over a three year estimated useful life 
amortization of acquired developed technology increased by  to  for  from  for to reflect a full year of amortization in compared with months in from the date of the mindlever acquisition 
cost of services revenues 
cost of services revenues decreased by  or  to million for  from million for we incurred substantial costs in related to start up and support services to build out our initial asp service capacity  some of which was carried over through cost of services revenues was of services revenues for and of services revenues for reflecting the growth in service revenues for combined with a decline in the cost of services revenues for the same period 
we anticipate that the cost of services revenues will increase to the extent that we continue to generate new customers and associated services revenues and continue to expand capacity of our asp service to meet demand 

table of contents sales and marketing expenses 
sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  to million for  from million for the decrease was primarily attributable to a reduction in marketing programs  including advertising  trade shows  and promotional expenses and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in sales commissions due to lower revenues 
sales and marketing expenses were of total revenues for and of total revenues for in the future  we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars as new marketing programs are developed to promote sales of our products and services into the real time enterprise collaboration market 
product development expenses 
product development expenses decreased by  or  to million for  from million for the decrease resulted from a decline in consulting costs as we reduced our use of consultants in  and shifted the work in house to existing employees to save costs  a decrease in recruitment fees as the number of new hires for the product development organization in declined by over  and a policy change in to eliminate the use of employment agencies for recruitment to save costs 
product development expenses were of total revenues for and of total revenues for we expect product development expenses to increase slightly in future periods as we make additional investments to further develop new  and enhance existing  products to address the real time enterprise collaboration market 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased by  or  to million for  from million for the increase was due primarily to increases in the cost of directors and officers liability insurance and increases in legal costs associated with the securities class action lawsuit and the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit see item  legal proceedings 
general and administrative expenses were of total revenues for and of total revenues for we anticipate that general and administrative expenses will increase by approximately million in related to severance charges and recruitment costs to be incurred in connection with our announcement in january to initiate a search for a new president and chief executive officer to succeed our current president and our current chief executive officer 
in addition  longer term  we expect our general and administrative expenses  primarily legal  audit and consulting expenses  will increase as a result of new and additional costs associated with recently enacted regulations for public companies by the us government  such as the sarbanes oxley act of compensation charge for issuance of stock options 
we incurred a charge of  or of total revenues for  a decrease of  from  or of total revenues in  related to the issuance of stock options with an exercise price lower than the fair market value on the date of grant during and these options  which vest over periods of between four and five years  will result in additional compensation expense of approximately  for periods ending subsequent to december  if all options vest in accordance with their original terms  we expect to incur charges of  in   in and  in acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the mindlever acquisition in april  we recorded a charge of million  or of the million in total consideration and liabilities assumed  for in process research and development costs  or iprd 
the value allocated to the project identified as iprd was charged to operations in the second quarter of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in connection with our acquisition of mindlever in april  we allocated approximately million to goodwill and  to other intangible assets for assembled workforce 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets were amortized over their useful estimated lives of five and three years  respectively 
for  amortization of goodwill and assembled workforce was  and  respectively 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 we combined assembled workforce with goodwill and did not amortize goodwill for 
table of contents impairment charges 
impairment charges recorded in were million 
there were no impairment charges recorded in under sfas no 
 goodwill is not amortized but is reviewed at least annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
we adopted our fourth quarter for our annual impairment analysis 
accordingly  we obtained an independent valuation in the fourth quarter for the purpose of conducting this impairment assessment 
as part of this assessment  we tested for impairment based on a two step approach 
the first step was to test for indicators of impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of the company with its carrying value 
since the company operates as a single reporting unit  we determined that a combination of the market value of the company and the net present value of the cash flows estimated to be produced by our assets over their useful lives represents an approximation of its fair value as of december furthermore  we determined that under this method  the fair value of the company as of the december assessment date was less than its carrying value and therefore  an indication of impairment existed 
the second step was to measure the amount of the impairment of goodwill 
in the second step  we calculated the implied fair value of the goodwill by allocating the fair value among all of our assets and liabilities as if the company had been acquired in a business combination 
the excess  if any  of the fair value over the amounts assigned to its assets and liabilities would be the implied fair value of goodwill 
we allocated the entire fair value of the company among our assets and liabilities and  therefore  concluded that the implied fair value of goodwill was zero 
we have  accordingly  recorded a charge equal to the entire carrying amount of the goodwill asset  or million  in the fourth quarter of  classified as an impairment charge in our consolidated statements of operations  to write down goodwill to its implied fair value of zero 
merger transaction costs 
in  we recorded a charge of million for costs incurred related to the proposed merger with smartforce plc 
the costs consisted primarily of advisory  legal and retainer fees 
we do not expect to incur any further costs related to this transaction 
restructuring charge 
in april  in light of changing market dynamics and economic factors  we reduced our workforce by approximately or positions  primarily in the product development group  and in the sales and services departments  both domestically and internationally 
as a result of the restructuring  the company recorded a restructuring charge in of  for the associated severance payments  benefits and outplacement services provided to the employees affected by the restructuring 
the entire amount of the restructuring charge was paid in and we do not expect to incur any further charges related to this restructuring 
interest income 
interest income decreased by million to  for  from million for interest income consists of interest on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
the decrease was primarily attributable to declines in both the balances of  and interest rates for  cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in interest and other expense 
interest expense decreased by  to  for  from  for the decrease was primarily attributable to the decrease in interest on our term loans as the result of a decrease in the bank s prime rate in other expense decreased by  to  for  from  for  and represents tangible net worth taxes and the net of foreign exchange gains and losses 
loss on sale of short term investments 
in january  we liquidated  prior to maturity  certain short term debt obligations of california based utilities when their ratings dropped below investment grade  which resulted in a realized loss of approximately  
table of contents comparison of and revenues

table of contents acquired in process research and development 
in connection with the mindlever acquisition in april  we recorded a charge of million  or of the million in total consideration and liabilities assumed  for in process research and development costs  or iprd 
the value allocated to the project identified as iprd was charged to operations in the second quarter of at the acquisition date  mindlever s major in process project was to add numerous new functionalities  new reports  an improved user interface and additional web capabilities to its existing elearning product version a portion of this technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative uses 
the technological feasibility of the in process product is established when the enterprise has completed all planning  designing  coding and testing activities that are necessary to establish that the product can be produced to meet its design specifications 
at the date of the acquisition  management estimated that completion of the project would be accomplished by the third quarter of the initial development effort commenced in december at the acquisition date  iprd was approximately complete  based on costs expended to date and estimated costs to complete the product 
at the date of the acquisition  the company expected to invest approximately  of additional development costs in this product 
the value of iprd was determined using an income approach 
this approach takes into consideration earnings remaining after deducting from cash flows related to the in process technology  the market rates of return on contributory assets including assembled workforce  customer accounts and existing technology 
the cash flows are then discounted to present value at an appropriate rate 
discount rates are determined by an analysis of the risks associated with each of the identified intangible assets 
the discount rate used for iprd was the estimated weighted average cost of capital of 
the resulting net cash flows to which the discount rate was applied are based on management s estimates of revenues  operating expenses  and income taxes from such acquired technology

amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
in connection with our acquisition of mindlever in april  we allocated approximately million to goodwill and  to other intangible assets for assembled workforce

table of contents liquidity and capital resources on february   we completed our initial public offering of  shares of common stock 
additionally  on march   the underwriters of the initial public offering exercised their over allotment option to purchase an additional  shares

centra has an equipment line of credit term loan facility  with a bank 
on december   may  and september   centra amended its equipment line of credit agreement to allow for additional borrowings of  and million  respectively  of which million remains outstanding at december  interest is payable monthly based on the prime rate at december  plus 
amounts outstanding are payable in equal monthly installments beginning on october  all borrowings are secured by substantially all of centra s assets 
the current amended equipment line of credit requires centra to maintain a minimum balance of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million and to hold of the company s cash  cash equivalents and short term investments in operating  deposit and investment accounts at the bank 
at december   the company was in compliance with the covenants under the equipment line of credit and approximately  was available for borrowings under the line 

table of contents capital expenditures totaled million for and million for our capital expenditures consisted of purchases of assets to manage our internal operations and our asp service  including computer hardware and software  office furniture and equipment and leasehold improvements 
purchases of computer equipment represent the largest component of our capital expenditures 
we expect capital expenditures to increase slightly from their levels of for the foreseeable future as we expand our asp service infrastructure and improve and expand our internal information systems 
since inception  we have generally funded capital expenditures either through the use of working capital or with equipment bank loans 
as of december   our primary financial commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under long term debt  capital and operating leases and other contractual obligations 
the company has commitments that expire at various times through operating leases shown below are primarily for facility costs for the company s corporate headquarters  its product development facility and worldwide sales offices 
other contractual obligations primarily consist of minimum royalty fees payable by the company in connection with two software royalty agreements and certain costs for the use of facilities at a third party internet service provider for our hosted and asp service offerings 
years ended december  long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases other contractual obligations total amounts in thousands total included in the operating lease commitments above is approximately  for excess facilities related to the acquisition of mindlever  which has been accrued in purchase accounting 
under the terms of our standard software license contracts  we indemnify our customers for the potential liability associated with the infringement of other parties technology based upon our software products 
there is a possibility that we could be found liable to our customers in the event that there is infringement occurring 
there currently are no claims pending against us alleging that we infringe the intellectual property rights of others and  therefore  we have not accrued any amounts for the replacement or refund of any software products sold or any indemnification costs related to any infringement through december  in july  a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of maryland naming centra as a defendant  alleging among other things that certain of our products infringed upon the plaintiff s patent rights  and the plaintiff sought injunctive relief and damages 
we settled this matter in november  and all claims against us were dismissed with prejudice 
see item  legal proceedings 
in january  we announced a management succession plan 
we have initiated a search for a new president and chief executive officer to succeed our current president and our current chief executive officer 
in february  we retained an executive recruiter to facilitate this search 
we are negotiating new severance agreements with our current president and our current chief executive officer to retain them during the search process and to effect an orderly transition 
under the arrangements  if the executive officer were terminated without cause  or resigned after the date on which a new chief executive officer was appointed  they would be entitled to receive their base salary  target annual bonus and certain benefits for a period of one year 
we anticipate that we will incur approximately million in costs associated with the management succession plan  including severance payments  which will be accounted for as an expense in and paid over the month period following their departure 

table of contents as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of million and research and development credit carryforwards of million 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards expire at various dates  beginning in through  if not used 
under the provisions of the internal revenue code  substantial changes in our ownership may limit the amount of net operating loss carryforwards that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income 
a full valuation allowance has been established in our consolidated financial statements to reflect the uncertainty of our ability to use available tax loss and tax credit carryforwards and other deferred tax assets 
days sales outstanding  or dso calculated as net accounts receivable divided by revenue per day for the previous days  at december  was days  a decline of days compared to dso as of december  any increase or decrease in our accounts receivable balance will affect our cash flow from operations and liquidity 
our accounts receivable and dso may increase due to changes in factors such as the timing of when sales are invoiced and the length of our customer s payment cycle 
we also record deferred maintenance billings as accounts receivable  and thus the timing of these billings can affect the dso calculation 
historically  international and indirect customers pay at a slower rate than domestic and direct customers 
an increase in revenue generated from international and indirect customers may increase our dso and accounts receivable balance 
also  due to the current economic climate  we may observe an increase in the length of our customers payment cycle 
to the extent that our accounts receivable balance increases  we may incur increased bad debt expense and will be subject to greater general credit risks 
in the past  we experienced a period of rapid growth that resulted in significant increases in our operating expenses 
more recently  due to economic conditions beyond our control  we have made considerable efforts to reduce our operating expenses through constrained spending and reductions in workforce 
we anticipate that our overall operating expenses in the immediate future will remain relatively flat or slightly increase as we continue our cost containment efforts and execute our business plan 
while we anticipate that our operating expenses and capital expenditures will constitute a material use of our cash resources  we may also utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in businesses  technologies  products or services that are complementary to our business 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances together with our short term investments will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
however  thereafter  we may need to raise additional funds to support our operations  or acquire complementary businesses or technologies 
if we seek to raise additional funds  we may not be able to obtain funds on terms that are favorable or acceptable to us 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  the securities could have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
see factors that could affect future results we may require additional funds in this item recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we do not believe that the impact of adopting sfas no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies disclosure and recognition measurement requirements related to certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december  and the recognition and measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the application of the requirements of fin did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations  however  we have added supplemental disclosure regarding customer indemnifications as discussed in note 
table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  as the company did not make a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation in  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
factors that could affect future results from time to time  information provided by us  statements made by our employees or information included in our filings with the securities and exchange commission may contain statements that are not historical facts but are forward looking statements involving risks and uncertainties 
in particular  statements in the management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations section of this report relating to management s expectations concerning our future results of operations and the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements may be forward looking statements 
the words expect  anticipate  intend  plan  believe  seek  estimate and similar expressions are intended to identify such forward looking statements 
such statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve risks  uncertainties and assumptions that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by us or on our behalf 
many of these factors are beyond our ability to control or predict 
readers are accordingly cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
centra disclaims any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether in response to new information or future events or otherwise 
important factors that could cause our actual results to differ from the forward looking statements described above include  but are not limited to  the factors outlined below 
our period operating results may fluctuate significantly 
this makes it more difficult to predict our future financial performance and increases the likelihood that our results for a particular period could fall below the expectations of investors  which could cause the price of our stock to drop rapidly and or severely 
we have in the past experienced fluctuations in our period operating results and anticipate that such fluctuations will continue and could intensify in the future 
as a result  it is likely that in one or more future quarters our results of operations will be below the expectations of public investors 
this could adversely affect the price of our common stock 
for example  in october  we announced revenues for the quarter ended september  that were substantially lower than had been expected by the investment community 
as a result of this announcement  the trading price of our common stock declined approximately by the end of the following trading day 
our operating results have fluctuated  and may continue to fluctuate  as a result of a number of factors  including the evolution of the market for elearning and real time enterprise collaboration solutions  market acceptance of our products and services  our success and timing in developing and introducing new products and enhancements to existing products  the introduction of products and services by current and new competitors  
table of contents pricing policies by us or our competitors  the length of our sales cycle  customer buying patterns and general market and economic conditions beyond the control of management 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenues 
as a result  any shortfall in revenues in relation to our expectations could result in increased period losses 
our success depends on the company s ability to identify and recruit a new ceo and president 
we are currently engaged in a search for an individual to replace our chief executive officer and our president 
our future success depends to a significant degree on our senior management team and our ability to identify and recruit an individual with sufficient qualifications and capabilities to replace these officers 
a change in our management team or the inability of our officers and key employees to work effectively as a team could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have incurred substantial losses in the past and may not achieve profitability in the future 
since we began operations  we have incurred substantial net losses in every fiscal period 
we cannot predict when we will become profitable  if at all  and if we do  we may not remain profitable for any substantial period of time 
if we fail to achieve profitability within the time frame expected by investors  the market price of our common stock may fall 
we had net losses of million in  million in and million in as a result of ongoing operating losses  we had an accumulated deficit of million at december  we expect to continue to incur significant sales and marketing  product development and general and administrative expenses and  as a result  we will need to generate significant revenues to achieve and maintain profitability 
we may not be able to generate sufficient revenues to attain profitability 
the length of our sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our quarterly operating results 
we have a long sales cycle because we generally need to educate potential customers regarding the benefits of our elearning and real time enterprise collaboration products and services before they will commit to the purchase of our products 
our sales cycle varies depending on the size and type of customer contemplating a purchase and whether we have conducted business with the customer in the past 
both new and existing customers frequently need to obtain approvals from multiple decision makers within their organization prior to making purchase decisions 
our sales cycle  which can range from several weeks to several quarters or more  makes it difficult to predict the period in which sales may occur 
delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenues and operating results for any particular period 
the development of the market for our real time enterprise collaboration products and services is uncertain 
the market for real time enterprise collaboration products and services is immature  evolving  uncertain and subject to rapid technological change 
also  we believe that general economic conditions over the past year have caused companies in our target market to be more cautious about making technology purchase decisions  which has negatively affected demand for our products and services 
if the market for real time enterprise business collaboration solutions does not grow at the rate we expect  this will have a material adverse effect on our business  our revenue growth rate  and our operating results and financial condition 
we face significant competition from other technology companies and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for elearning and real time enterprise collaboration products and services is highly competitive 
we expect that our competition in this market will intensify in the future which is likely to result in price 
table of contents reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any one of which could seriously harm our business 
competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services offered 
we encounter competition with respect to different aspects of our real time enterprise collaboration solution from a variety of software and services vendors 
in addition  bigger companies with more resources than we have could enter our market and either reduce our sales or require us to lower our prices  or both 
some of our competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than we do 
some have significantly greater name recognition and a larger installed base of customers 
in addition  many of our competitors have well established relationships with our current and potential customers 
in the past  we have lost potential customers to competitors for various reasons  including lower prices and other incentives not matched by us 
in addition  current and potential competitors have established or may establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties to increase the ability of their products to address customer needs 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
our success depends on our ability to more effectively utilize our sales force and indirect distribution channels 
to increase our revenues  we must optimize our direct sales force and continue to enhance relationships with our value added resellers  integrated technology solution partners and alliance partners  including technology  content and service providers  to leverage our indirect distribution channel 
we intend to focus on improving the productivity and effectiveness of our sales organization over the next months through training and focused marketing programs 
however  we cannot be sure that we will be successful in training and motivating our sales staff to increase productivity or in retaining qualified sales personnel 
in addition  we must effectively leverage our relationships with our indirect channel and alliance partners 
our existing  or future  indirect channel and alliance partners may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies including our competitors 
also  we may face conflicts between our sales force and our indirect channel and alliance partners 
our inability to effectively optimize the efforts of our direct sales force and our indirect distribution channel could limit our future revenue growth and hurt our future operating results 
our performance depends on our ability to win business and obtain follow on sales 
customers typically place small initial orders for our products to allow them to evaluate their performance 
a key element of our business to date and our future strategy is to expand usage of our products within the customer organization to generate more significant follow on sales 
our financial performance depends on successful initial deployments of our products that  in turn  lead to follow on sales 
if the initial deployments of our products are unsuccessful  we may be unable to obtain follow on sales 
in addition  even if initial deployments are successful  there can be no assurances that customers will choose to make follow on purchases  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues 
future regulations could be enacted that either directly restrict our business or indirectly impact our business by limiting the growth of internet based business and services 
as commercial use of the internet increases  federal  state and foreign agencies could enact laws or adopt regulations covering issues such as user privacy  content and taxation of products and services 
if enacted  such laws or regulations could limit the market for our products and services 
although they might not apply to our business directly  we expect that laws or rules regulating personal and consumer information could indirectly affect our business 
it is possible that such legislation or regulation could expose companies involved in providing internet based services to liability  which could limit the growth of web use generally and thereby reduce demand for our products and services 
such legislation or regulation could dampen the growth in web usage and decrease its acceptance as a medium of communications and commerce 

table of contents our future success will depend on our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services 
our future success will depend in large part on our ability to enhance and broaden our elearning and real time enterprise collaboration products and services to meet the evolving needs of the market 
our market is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  frequent new product and service introductions  and evolving industry standards 
the recent growth of the internet and intense competition in our industry exacerbate these market characteristics 
to achieve our goals  we need to respond effectively to technological changes and new industry standards and developments 
in the past  we have experienced delays in the introduction of new products 
in addition  our product enhancements must meet the requirements of our current and prospective customers and must achieve significant market acceptance 
we could also incur substantial costs if we need to modify our products  services or information technology infrastructure to adapt to these changes  standards and developments 
we may be unable to hire and retain skilled personnel 
qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the software industry 
our success depends  in large part  upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly software engineers  professional services personnel  sales and marketing personnel and other senior personnel 
our failure to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are integral to our product development  professional services and direct sales teams may limit the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we face business risks relating to our international operations 
in addition to our north american operations  we have established sales  marketing and service operations in europe and the pacific rim and we sell through distributors and resellers in a number of countries around the world 
these activities require resources and management attention beyond those required for our domestic operations and subject us to additional regulatory  economic and political risks 
given our limited experience in international markets  we cannot be sure that our international operations will be successful 
in addition  we face added risks in doing business internationally 
these risks could reduce demand for our products and services  lower the prices at which we can sell our products and services  or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating results 
among the risks we believe are most likely to affect us are longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable  adverse changes in trade and tax regulations  the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights  the adoption of data privacy laws or regulations  selling under contracts governed by local law  difficulties in managing an organization spread over several countries  including complications arising from cultural  language and time differences that may lengthen sales and implementation cycles  localization of technology  disruption caused by terrorist activities in various regions around the world  political and economic instability and currency risks  including fluctuations in exchange rates 

table of contents we rely on third party technology to enhance our products 
we incorporate into our products software licensed from third party software companies that enhances  enables or provides functionality for our products 
third party software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or with acceptable levels of support or functionality  or at all 
failure to maintain those license arrangements  failure of the third party vendors to provide updates  modifications or future versions of their software or defects and errors in or infringement claims against those third party products could delay or impair our ability to develop and sell our products 
our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology 
if we fail to protect our proprietary rights  other companies might copy our technology and introduce products or services that compete with ours  without paying us for our technology 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our proprietary technology includes the centra registered trademark  among others  and one pending us patent application  which has not yet been approved 
we depend upon a combination of patent and trademark laws  license agreements  non disclosure and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary and distribution rights of our products 
in addition  we attempt to protect our proprietary information and those of our vendors and partners through confidentiality and license agreements with our employees and others 
although we have taken steps to protect our proprietary technology  they may be inadequate 
existing trade secret  copyright and trademark laws offer only limited protection 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive  even if we were to prevail 
claims by other companies that we infringe their proprietary technology could force us to redesign our products or otherwise hurt our financial condition 
if we were to discover that any of our products violated third party proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that we would be able to reengineer the product or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  that would enable us to continue offering the product without substantial reengineering 
also  our sales terms state that we will indemnify our customers for any of their costs as a result of our infringement on other s technology  if any 
such costs could be substantial 
we do not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties 
in addition  product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly developing technology environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending  many of which are confidential when filed  with regard to similar technologies 
any claim of infringement could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim  even if the claim is invalid  and could distract our management from our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our products or cause our customers to stop using our products 
in july  a complaint was filed in the united states district court for the district of maryland naming centra as a defendant  alleging among other things that certain of our products infringed upon the plaintiff s patent rights  and the plaintiff sought injunctive relief and damages 
we settled this matter in november  and all claims against centra have been dismissed with prejudice 
see item  legal proceedings 
our business could be adversely affected if our products contain errors 
software products as complex as ours may contain undetected errors or bugs that result in product failures 
from time to time we have identified errors in our products after commercial introduction of the products 
while we have not been materially harmed by errors in the past  the occurrence of errors in the future could result in loss of or delay in revenues  loss of market share  diversion of product development resources  injury to our reputation or damage to our efforts to build brand awareness  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 

table of contents we could incur substantial costs resulting from product liability claims relating to our customers use of our products and services 
many of the business interactions supported by our products and services are critical to our customers businesses 
any failure in a customer s business interaction or other collaborative activity caused or allegedly caused by our products and services could result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
although we maintain general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions  there can be no assurance that our existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
our failure to effectively manage changes in the business environment in which we operate could hurt our business 
our failure to effectively manage changes in the business environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on the quality of our products  our ability to retain key personnel and our business  operating results and financial condition 
historically  we experienced a period of rapid growth that placed a significant strain on all of our resources 
however  in april  based upon economic factors beyond our control  we implemented a reduction in workforce of positions 
we may experience similar changes in the future 
to effectively manage changes in the business environment in which we operate we must maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls  maintain our ability to retain key personnel and integrate new personnel and manage our operations globally 
increased utilization and costs of our technical support services may adversely affect our financial results 
our products involve very complex technology and the failure or inability of our technical support staff to meet customer expectations in a timely manner or customer dissatisfaction with our product functionality or performance could result in loss of revenues  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  injury to our reputation  liability for service or warranty costs and claims and other increased costs 
we may be unable to respond to fluctuations in customer demand for support services as well as resolve customer issues in a manner that is timely and satisfactory to them 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors 
we may require additional funds 
we expect that our current cash  cash equivalents and short term investments will be adequate to provide us with sufficient working capital for at least the next months 
however  our current plans and projections may prove to be inaccurate or our expected cash flow may prove to be insufficient to fund our operations because of product delays  unanticipated expenses or other unforeseen difficulties 
therefore  we may need to raise additional capital in order to fund the development and marketing of our products and services 
our ability to obtain additional financing will depend on a number of factors  including market conditions  our operating performance and investor interest  particularly in real time enterprise collaboration software companies 
these factors may make the timing  amount  terms and conditions of any financing unattractive 
they may also result in our incurring additional indebtedness or accepting stockholder dilution 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may have to forego strategic acquisitions or investments  defer our product development activities  or delay our continued rollout of new products and product versions 
any of these actions may seriously harm our business and operating results 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
our stock price  like that of other technology companies  has been extremely volatile 
the announcement of new products  services  technological innovations  customers or distribution partners by us or our competitors  
table of contents quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in revenues or earnings estimates by securities analysts  speculation in the press or investment community and overall economic conditions are among the factors affecting our stock price 
in addition  the stock market in general and the market prices for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
recently  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management away from operating the business 
if we acquire another business  we may not be able to successfully integrate the technologies and or personnel acquired and  as a result  may not realize the expected benefits of such acquisition 
in the future  we may acquire additional businesses or product lines  if management believes that doing so would complement or enhance our existing products  services and technologies or assist us in achieving growth 
if we do  then we face the risk that an acquired product  service or technology might not perform as expected 
prior to completing an acquisition  however  it is difficult to determine if such benefits can actually be realized 
the process of integrating acquired companies into our business may also result in unforeseen difficulties 
unforeseen operating difficulties may absorb significant management attention  which we might otherwise devote to our existing business 
also  the process may require significant financial resources that we might otherwise allocate to other activities  including the ongoing development or expansion of our existing operations 
if we pursue a future acquisition or business combination  our management could spend a significant amount of time and effort identifying and completing the transaction 
if we make a future acquisition  we could issue equity securities that would dilute current stockholders percentage ownership  use cash or incur substantial debt  which would reduce our financial liquidity  assume contingent liabilities  incur a one time charge or be required to recognize goodwill  or any combination of the foregoing 
our historical operating results may not be indicative of future performance 
because of the foregoing factors  our operating results are difficult to forecast 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not meaningful  and you should not rely on them as indicative of our future performance 
you should also evaluate our prospects in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties commonly encountered by comparable early stage companies in new and rapidly emerging markets 
we cannot assure you that we will successfully address the risks and challenges that face us 
in addition  although we have experienced significant revenue growth in the past  we cannot assure you that our revenues will continue to grow or that we will become or remain profitable in the future 
certain provisions of our charter and of delaware law make a takeover of our company more difficult 
our corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company 
these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of centra or a change in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
the existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
additionally  the company has entered into employment and executive retention agreements with certain employees and executive officers  which  among other things  include certain severance and change of control provisions

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk related to foreign currency exchange rates and to changes in interest rates 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
foreign currency we develop products in the united states and sell them worldwide 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
international sales are typically denominated in euros  british pounds  australian dollars or in u 
s dollars 
since some of our sales internationally are currently priced in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
in the year ended december   the company generated approximately of its revenues outside of the united states 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
translation gains and losses are deferred and accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions are netted and included in other expense  net  in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
a change in the valuation of the functional currencies relative to the us dollar as of december   would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations for the year ended december  interest rates we maintain a short term investment portfolio consisting mainly of fixed rate us government backed federal agency notes and highly liquid money market instruments  with an average maturity of less than months  in accordance with our investment policy approved by the company s board of directors 
our general investing policy is to limit the risk of principal loss and seek to ensure the safety of invested funds by limiting market and credit risk 
we currently use a registered investment manager to place our investments  which are typically held to maturity 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are only invested in short term deposits of the local operating bank 
all highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less are considered to be cash equivalents 
investments in fixed rate interest earning financial instruments are subject to interest rate risk and will decrease in value if market interest rates were to increase 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the portfolio 
if market interest rates were to decline  the interest earned on our investment portfolio would decrease 
we estimate that if the average yield of our investments had decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december   would have decreased by less than  this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of the year and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the impact on our future interest income and future changes in investment yields will largely depend on the gross amount of our portfolio 
our long term debt and available line of credit require interest payments calculated at variable interest rates 
if interest rates were to increase  the interest payments on our long term debt would also increase 
the effect of any such increase in interest expense would be partially offset by any resulting increase in interest income from our investment portfolio 
in january  we liquidated certain short term debt obligations of california based electric utilities when their ratings dropped below investment grade  which resulted in a realized loss of approximately
