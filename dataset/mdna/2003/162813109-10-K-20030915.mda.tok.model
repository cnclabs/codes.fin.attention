item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview checkfree was founded in as an electronic payment processing company and has become a leading provider of financial electronic commerce products and services 
our current business was developed through the expansion of our core electronic payments business and the acquisition of companies operating in similar or complementary businesses 
we operate our business through three independent but inter related divisions electronic commerce  investment services  and software 
through our electronic commerce division  we enable consumers to receive and pay bills electronically 
for the year ended june   we processed approximately million electronic payment transactions and delivered approximately million electronic bills 
for the quarter ended june   we processed nearly million transactions and delivered approximately million electronic bills 
during the quarter ended june   over ten million consumers initiated a payment through checkfree managed services 
the number of transactions we process each year continues to grow 
for the year ended june   growth in the number of transactions processed exceeded 
the electronic commerce division accounted for approximately of our annual revenue 
our electronic commerce division s products allow consumers to receive electronic bills through the internet  pay any bill whether it arrives over the internet or through traditional mail to anyone  make payments not related to bills to anyone  and perform customary banking transactions  including balance inquiries  transfers between accounts and online statement reconciliations 
through our investment services division  we provide a range of portfolio management services to financial institutions  including broker dealers  money managers and investment advisors 
as of june   our clients used the checkfree apl portfolio accounting system to manage over million portfolios  totaling more than billion in assets 
the investment services division accounts for approximately of our annual revenue 
our institutional client base includes investment advisors  brokerage firms  banks and insurance companies 
our fee based money manager clients are typically sponsors or managers of wrap or separately managed accounts  money management products  or traditional money managers  managing investments of institutions and high net worth individuals 
we also support a growing number of third party vendors providing quick to market turnkey solutions 
our portfolio management products and services are marketed under the product names checkfree apl and checkfree apl wrap  and provide the following functions account open and trading capabilities  graphical client reporting  performance measurement  decision support tools  account analytics  tax lot accounting  multiple strategy portfolios  straight through processing  depository trust corporation interfacing  billing functions  and system and data security

marketed under m pact  m search and m watch  these products are a result of the acquisition of mobius group  inc in march through our software division  we deliver software  maintenance  support and professional services to large financial service providers and other companies across a range of industries 
our software division is comprised of three units  each with its own distinct set of software products

total revenue increased by  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  total company revenue growth was driven by growth in our electronic commerce business  growth in our software business and growth in our investment services business 
growth in our electronic commerce business is driven primarily by growth in total transactions processed from approximately million for the year ended june   to over million for the year ended june  please refer to the segment information section of this report  electronic commerce division  for an analysis of changes in the mix of business inherent in our transaction growth 
additionally  revenue related to minimum guarantees from microsoft and first data corporation have increased in total by million on a year over year basis 
growth in electronic commerce revenue has been dampened somewhat by a decrease in interest rates  which has negatively impacted our interest sensitive offerings  such as our account balance transfer product  by certain of our larger customers transferring payment volume to in house solutions during the most recent fiscal year  and by a large customer reaching pricing tier discounts during the year due to significant volume growth 
our software business has continued to grow in spite of customers taking longer than normal to evaluate discretionary investment spending alternatives  such as third party software product offerings 
we experienced relatively strong software license sales in our seasonally high june and december quarters and we were engaged in a significant software services agreement during the year  which combined to provide a near term boost to software revenue  however  until the economy rebounds  we expect to experience modest growth in our software business 
growth in our investment services business has been dampened by poor stock market conditions 
portfolios managed have remained relatively flat over the past year or so  as investors reducing stock holdings have offset new portfolio growth 
pricing in investment services is primarily based on portfolios managed  and as a result  we have experienced less than historical revenue growth in this business 
we expect this trend to continue until stock market performance improves 
across all segments of our business  for the year ended june   bank of america generated total revenue of million  which exceeds of our total revenue  and remains the only customer that exceeds of our total revenue 
the agreement with bank of america has a ten year term  includes annual minimum guarantees of million and includes tiered pricing which is competitive with pricing we offer our other customers  based on volumes of activity provided by bank of america 
our processing and servicing revenue increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  processing and servicing revenue occurs in both our electronic commerce and investment services businesses 
as previously mentioned  portfolios managed have remained fairly flat year over year  and as a result  we have seen only modest growth in processing and servicing revenue from our investment services business 
growth in processing and servicing revenue has therefore come primarily from growth in transactions processed within our electronic commerce business 
additionally  we delivered almost million electronic bills in the year ended june   as compared to approximately million bills in the previous year 
in conjunction with our acquisition of transpoint in september  we entered into agreements with microsoft and first data corporation  both of which include monthly minimum revenue guarantees that increase annually over the five year term of the agreements 
the following table represents the total annual minimum revenue guarantees throughout the five year contract period with microsoft and first data corporation in thousands fiscal year ended june  microsoft first data total total    we are operating below the minimum levels in both agreements and  as a result of increased minimum levels  revenue from microsoft and first data grew by million from the year ended june   to the year ended june  reductions in interest yields from this time last year have had a dampening effect on our interest sensitive products such as our account balance transfer offering  which has offset further growth in electronic commerce processing and servicing revenue 
furthermore  our largest customer reached cliff based pricing milestones in the quarters ended december   and june   which reduced our revenue per subscriber for that customer by between and 
while much less in magnitude  we expect the same customer to reach an additional pricing milestone around the end of the calendar year 
at the end of our fiscal year  we introduced transaction based metrics designed to help investors better understand trends in our business 
we offer two basic levels of electronic billing and payment services to our customers 
customers that use our full service offering generally outsource their electronic billing and payment process to us 
for instance  a full service customer might not use a checkfree hosted user interface  but still use our full array of services  including payment processing  payment warehouse  claims processing  e bill  online proof of payment  customer care  and other aspects of our service 
also  while a full service customer may build its own payment warehouse  we may maintain a customer record and payment history within our payment warehouse to support the full service customer s servicing needs 
customers in the full service category may contract to pay us either on a per subscriber basis  a per transaction basis  or a blend of both 
customers that utilize our payment services offering receive a limited subset of our electronic billing and payment services 
additionally  within payment services  we provide services to billers for electronic bill delivery and hosting  as well as other payment services  such as account balance transfer 
a third category of revenue we simply refer to as other electronic commerce 
other electronic commerce includes our health and fitness business and other ancillary revenue sources  such as csp and biller implementation and consulting services 
as we have previously reported  three of our larger customers  all of whom were original principals of a consortium known as spectrum  have created and begun using in house payment warehouses for routing electronic bill payment transactions  and each is in various stages of this transition process 
for payment processing services  each of the three principal banks signed a multi year transaction processing agreement with metavante  a payment processing division of marshall and ilsley corporation m i  which included guaranteed minimum transaction levels during the contract period 
as a result  each of these banks is routing payment transactions to metavante in order to meet these minimum requirements 
jp morgan chase  which has historically maintained an in house payment warehouse as a payment services customer of checkfree  moved all of its internet based bill payment transactions  except for those processed through personal financial management pfm programs such as intuit s quicken or microsoft money  to metavante during the quarter ended december  wells fargo has begun directing new electronic bill payment customers onto its in house system and has been routing some payments from existing customers to metavante over the second half of fiscal we expect to see a significant volume of wells fargo transactions diverted during the quarter ending september  wachovia initiated its in house payment warehouse at the end of the quarter ended december   and has been migrating legacy wachovia bill pay customers  on a state by state basis  onto its in house system 
their migration was effectively completed by june  we are not aware of any plans in place at this time to migrate legacy first union customers to the wachovia in house system 
we are working with wells fargo to integrate their payment systems with checkfree in order to continue to process transactions for them 
wells fargo announced in april that  together  we have enabled their in house system with e bill capability 
for reference purposes  wells fargo currently operates as a payment services customer while wachovia operates as a full service customer 
a fourth bank customer  bank one  has announced intentions to move its electronic payment processing to an in house payment solution as well 
bank one started processing payments late in fiscal  and we expect the remainder of its electronic payment transaction volumes to decrease significantly beginning in the quarter ended september   as it fully enables its system and takes payment processing in house 
we believe that the complexity and costs of building  supporting  and hosting an in house payment warehouse and user interface are substantial  and execution is likely limited to a few large banks 
regardless  we expect to compete for payment transaction volume from banks that ultimately choose an in house payment routing alternative 
our license fee revenue decreased million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  license revenue is derived from our software business 
the economy continues to cause potential customers to extend their evaluation time on discretionary spending for such things as software products  which has resulted in slower than normal software license sales 
we expect this trend to continue until the economy begins to rebound 
our maintenance fee revenue increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  maintenance revenue  which represents annually renewable product support for our software customers  is isolated to our software business 
a combination of a decrease in new license sales  customer retention rates of at least across all of our software business units  and moderate price increases on a year over year basis  resulted in a moderately increasing maintenance base 
we defer revenue recognition on maintenance billings until cash is collected  which can cause quarter to quarter fluctuations in maintenance revenue 
until license sales regain historical growth rates  we expect to see moderate growth in maintenance 
our other revenue increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  other revenue consists of consulting and implementation fees across all three of our business segments 
the primary driver of growth in this area is a consulting services project we were engaged in with a large bank customer within our ach software business unit in fiscal cost of processing  servicing and support 
our cost of processing  servicing and support was million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june   and was million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june  cost of processing  servicing and support as a percentage of processing and servicing only revenue total revenue less license fees was for the year ended june   versus for the year ended june  the largest single factor resulting in the decline in processing and servicing costs  in light of growth in processing and servicing revenue  was platform consolidation in our electronic commerce business late in fiscal for most of fiscal  we maintained three redundant payment processing platforms 
through december  we were converting bank of america subscribers from the legacy bank of america processing platform we purchased in october and  through march  we maintained the redundant system to close out remaining customer care inquiries and claims  at which time we retired the redundant processing platform 
through this period  we paid bank of america to run and maintain the platform for us 
once we retired the bank of america system  we were able to close our customer care facility in san francisco on april   and our houston customer care facility in the month ended june  additionally  as we migrated all but a few csps off of our legacy austin processing platform onto genesis by the end of june  we closed our austin office as well 
the combination of platform consolidation and office closings eliminated approximately million of redundant quarterly processing and servicing costs in the electronic commerce business 
additionally  our electronic payment rate has improved from approximately for the year ended june   to over for the year ended june  electronic payments carry a significantly lower variable cost per unit than do paper based payments and are far less likely to result in a costly customer care claim 
we continue to invest in additional efficiency and quality improvements within our customer care processes and our information technology infrastructure to drive improvements in our total cost per transaction 
we expect these efforts to result in further improvement in cost per transaction in future periods 
research and development 
our research and development costs were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june   and were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june  last fiscal year  on march   we announced a company reorganization that resulted in a reduction in workforce that impacted all areas of the company  including research and development 
the reduction resulted in savings on a year over year basis 
however  we continue to invest significantly in product enhancement and quality improvement programs in all three of our businesses 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing costs were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june   and were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june  during the current fiscal year  we introduced new relationship management and account management positions in our investment services business  however  the previously mentioned reorganization  announced on march   also impacted sales and marketing expenses resulting in a year over year reduction of costs 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative costs were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june   and were million  or for the year ended june  in addition to reduced rental and related overhead expense from facilities closed late in fiscal and improved collection experience resulting in favorable bad debt expenses year over year  we continue to carefully manage our corporate expenses  resulting in expected leverage in our overhead costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization costs decreased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  in july  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
instead  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for possible impairment 
we will continue to amortize all other intangible assets  such as acquired technology  strategic agreements  tradenames  and the like  over their respective useful lives 
as a result of the change  amortization from acquisition related intangible assets has decreased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  underlying depreciation and amortization from operating fixed assets and internally developed product costs has increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the increase in non acquisition related depreciation and amortization is the result of continued investment in new product innovations and fixed assets necessary to support the continued growth of the company 
impairment of intangible assets 
charges for the impairment of intangible assets have decreased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  in the quarter ended december   we recorded intangible asset impairment charges totaling million 
this was the combined result of a charge of million for the impairment of goodwill associated with our acquisition of bluegill technologies in april currently known as checkfree i solutions  and of million for the retirement of certain technology assets we acquired from transpoint in september in the quarter ended june   we recorded intangible asset impairment charges totaling approximately million associated with our annual assessment of the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible asset balances  particularly in our i solutions business unit 
upon adoption of sfas in the quarter ended september   we incurred an additional million impairment of intangible assets that is described in the coming paragraph labeled cumulative effect of accounting change  which is reflected separately in our consolidated statement of operations 
upon successful integration of bluegill technologies into the operations of our software business  during fiscal  we established a revenue outlook for fiscal that anticipated continued rapid growth in software license sales 
we experienced a drop in demand for electronic billing software during the quarter ended september   however  we did not believe this would impact our longer term expectations for this product line and  therefore  in our estimation  there was no impairment at that time 
when software sales declined again in the quarter ended december   we reevaluated our long term expectations and viewed this as a triggering event that required evaluation of possible impairment per the guidelines of sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of 
our tests relative to the total tangible and intangible assets related to the i solutions product line revealed that the assets were in fact impaired 
this resulted in a charge of million to write down the value of goodwill related to the acquisition of bluegill 
as part of the acquisition of transpoint in september  we were contractually required to maintain the transpoint operating technology for up to three years for any customer that wished to remain on the system 
when valuing the transpoint assets  we established an intangible asset for current technology and assigned it a three year life 
by december   we had migrated all of the subscribers  billers and csps to our genesis platform and the last of our international partners gave notice of their intention to cancel their maintenance agreement with us during the december quarter 
additionally  we had recently concluded that components of the transpoint technology were not compatible with current or future planned initiatives 
we viewed these as triggering events that required the evaluation of possible impairment per sfas our overall testing indicated that there was no impairment of the transpoint assets in general  however  we then evaluated sfas requirements related to the retirement of assets and identified two technologies for which we had no future use 
we retired these two technologies  resulting in a charge of million in the quarter ended december  throughout fiscal  there were no triggering events that caused us to evaluate the recoverability of our intangible asset balance 
in april  we performed our annual evaluation of intangible asset recoverability 
our initial tests indicated a potential impairment of goodwill in our i solutions reporting unit 
our follow up tests included an sfas recoverability test of our technology assets  which indicated no issues  and a sfas test  which resulted in an impairment of million in one of our non goodwill intangible assets 
the final sfas test resulted in a further impairment of million in our i solutions goodwill balance for a total charge of million 
reorganization charge 
our reorganization charges decreased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  in january  we announced plans to close our customer care facility in san francisco  effective april   which resulted in the termination of employees at that facility 
at that time we also announced our intent to eliminate certain of our financial planning products within our investment services division  which also resulted in a small reduction of employees in our raleigh  north carolina office 
on march   we further announced the closing of our houston and austin  texas offices  our ann arbor  michigan office and our singapore office  combined with a net reduction in force totaling employees 
as a result of those actions  we incurred charges totaling million consisting primarily of severance and related employee benefits and lease termination fees 
we accounted for these actions in accordance with emerging task force eitf abstract number  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
due primarily to our inability to sublease abandoned office space as originally expected  in the quarter ended june   we recorded million of additional reorganization charges to true up our estimates from the actions we initiated in fiscal interest 
interest income declined from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  an increase in invested balances of cash  short term and long term investments from to was offset by reduced yields from lower interest rates during fiscal interest expense has increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the increase is due primarily to an increase in long term lease obligations during fiscal anchored by the fixed rate on our million of outstanding convertible debt  average interest rates have remained stable for us over these periods 
loss on investments 
in the year ended june   we incurred a charge of million for losses in investments 
due primarily to a decline in the market value of one of our investments in a private imaging company  which had been below our book value for over six months  we judged this to be an other than temporary decline in the market value and  accordingly  in the quarter ended march   we recorded a charge of million to reflect the loss 
due to a decline in the market value of our investment in payment data systems  inc formerly billserv  inc  which had been below our book basis for over six months at the time  we also judged this to be an other than temporary decline in the investment and in the quarter ended december   we recorded a charge of million to reflect the loss 
income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million  with an effective rate of  for the year ended june   and an income tax benefit of million  with an effective rate of  for the year ended june  our june   pre tax income included the impact of non deductible goodwill amortization expense 
with our adoption of sfas in july  we stopped amortizing goodwill 
our resulting effective tax rate in fiscal is now more in line with a blended statutory rate of about  with the exception of federal and state tax credits that have more than offset other non deductible expense 
cumulative effect of accounting change 
on july   we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
in accordance with sfas  we were required to perform a transitional impairment test 
the test was performed as of july  this impairment test required us to identify our reporting units  determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units  and determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
if the carrying value of any reporting unit exceeded its fair value  then the amount of any goodwill impairment was determined through fair value analysis of each of the assigned assets excluding goodwill and liabilities 
as a result of the transitional impairment test  we determined that goodwill associated with our i solutions reporting unit was impaired 
we recorded an impairment charge of million  which is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  refer to note goodwill and other intangible assets in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements  for further discussion regarding the current year and expected future impact of this change on our depreciation and amortization expense 
years ended june  and revenues 
our total revenue increased by  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  total company revenue growth was driven by growth in our electronic commerce business and growth in our investment services business  offset by a decline in our software business 
growth in electronic commerce revenue was driven primarily by growth in total transactions processed from million for the year ended june   to over million for the year ended june  the impact of growth in transactions processed was offset by a decline in revenue from interest rate sensitive products  such as our account balance transfer product  caused by significant decreases in interest rates from fiscal in october  we entered into an agreement with a third party in which we issued warrants on one million shares of our stock  exercisable on september   contingent upon maintaining the existence of our agreement through that date 
during the quarter ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million against revenue resulting from the probable vesting of those warrants to the third party 
growth in investment services was driven primarily by an increase in portfolios managed from over million at june   to about million at june   offset by industry consolidations which resulted in the loss of over million portfolios in fiscal the majority of these portfolios processed at a lower price point than average  based on the service level provided  resulting in a reduced negative impact 
also  in the quarter ended march   we announced the elimination of certain of our financial planning software products within investment services  resulting in a modest decrease in revenue as the product line was in existence the full year in fiscal and less than three quarters of the year in fiscal as a result of the difficult stock market conditions that worsened since late september  portfolio growth slowed significantly  and we remained short of historic growth rates in this part of our business 
due also to poor economic conditions in fiscal  we experienced a decline in revenue in our software business on a year over year basis 
although revenue from our more mature ach processing and reconciliation products had remained relatively stable  sales of our i solutions electronic billing and statement software were lower than expected as the recession continued 
across all segments of our business  for the year ended june   bank of america generated total revenue of million  which represented in excess of of our total revenue in fiscal  and they were the only customer to exceed of our total revenue 
because they owned approximately million shares of our stock at the time  bank of america was considered a related party 
our processing and servicing revenue increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  within electronic commerce  growth in underlying processing and servicing revenue was driven by the previously mentioned growth in subscribers and transactions 
our acquisition of transpoint in september included a five year strategic agreement with microsoft and a five year marketing agreement with first data corporation  each of which includes minimum quarterly revenue guarantees  as does our ten year strategic agreement with bank of america 
through june   the agreements with microsoft and first data were operating below the minimum guarantee level 
the bank of america contract operated under minimums until the december  quarter 
as a result of these minimum guarantees  overall subscriber based revenue correlated less directly with subscriber growth 
additionally  we processed over million electronic bills in the month ended june   which was a significant increase from the million electronic bills processed in the month ended march   and the  electronic bills processed in the month ended june  this growth was offset by a decline in revenue from interest rate sensitive products and the previously mentioned million non cash charge we recorded against revenue related to warrants we issued to a third party in in the quarter ended june   jp morgan chase announced plans to utilize in house technologies to build and manage their own electronic billing and payment user interface and payment warehouse 
our license fee revenue decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  license sales had dropped off during the recessionary period that began toward the end of fiscal and continued throughout fiscal while sales in our more mature ach processing and reconciliation software products had remained fairly stable  sales of our i solutions electronic billing and statement software have continued to fall short of our expectations 
the reduction in expected license sales in our i solutions business unit resulted in our recording an impairment charge relative to the intangible assets we recorded as part of our acquisition of bluegill 
the charge is explained in the paragraph labeled impairment of intangible assets later in this analysis 
our maintenance fee revenue increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  maintenance tends to grow with incremental software license sales from the last four quarters  combined with annual retention rates of existing customers that exceed across all product lines 
although software sales have declined on a year over year basis  because of the annuity effect of a renewing customer base  we have continued to experience growth in maintenance revenue 
pricing did not have a material impact on maintenance revenue growth 
our other revenue decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the decline in other revenue was the combined result of lower biller implementation fees in our electronic commerce business  lower software implementation engagements from lower software sales in our software business and lower implementation and custom reporting fees in our investment services business 
cost of processing  servicing and support 
our cost of processing  servicing and support was million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june   and was million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june  cost of processing  servicing and support  as a percentage of processing only revenue  was for the year ended june   versus for the year ended june  we achieved improved efficiency and processing quality within our genesis processing platform in our electronic commerce business 
our ratio of electronic payments to total payments improved from at june   to over at june  electronic payments carry a significantly lower variable cost per unit than paper based payments and are far less likely to result in a costly customer inquiry or claim 
the full underlying impact of improved efficiency and quality  however  is not fully explained in these results 
we acquired transpoint in september and the electronic billing and payment assets of bank of america in october as a result of these transactions  we supported two additional billing and payment platforms for much of the year ended june   and one additional platform through march   as we worked to migrate subscribers and billers over to genesis 
the acquired platforms were less efficient than our genesis processing platform  and therefore much more expensive to operate 
as an example  during fiscal alone  we incurred approximately million in costs paid to bank of america for their support of the bank of america west processing platform during the conversion process 
we completed the conversion of the transpoint subscribers and billers onto our genesis platform in the quarter ended june  we completed the conversion of a portion of the bank of america east operations in the quarter ended march   and the remainder of the bank of america subscribers  referred to as bank of america west  to genesis in the quarter ended december  after resolving the backlog of open customer care inquiry and claims during the quarter ended march   we retired the bank of america processing platform and were no longer required to reimburse bank of america for running the platform on our behalf 
additionally  we migrated all but a few csps off of our austin processing platform and relocated the remaining technologies to our norcross  georgia facility 
as a result of these retirements  we closed our san francisco customer care facility effective april   our houston customer care facility effective june   and closed our austin office effective september  the retirement of the bank of america platform and the resulting closing of the san francisco  houston and austin offices resulted in a recurring reduction in our quarterly processing cost of almost million beginning in the quarter ended june   and increasing to approximately million in the quarter ended september  the net impact of the above programs and actions resulted in a decrease of over in our direct cost per transaction processed in the year ended june  refer to the reorganization charge paragraph below and note in the notes to consolidated financial statements within this report for further information regarding the one time charge we recorded as a result of the reorganization actions 
research and development 
our research and development costs were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june   and million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june  adjusted for capitalized development costs  our gross research and development costs were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june   and million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june  during fiscal years and  we invested heavily in research and development activities to enhance our product offerings and further distance ourselves from our competition 
we continued to invest consistently in research and development activities on a gross dollar basis in all of our business segments during fiscal in anticipation and support of revenue growth  quality enhancement and efficiency improvement opportunities 
on march   we announced a company reorganization that resulted in a reduction in workforce that impacted all areas of the company  including research and development 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing costs were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june   and were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june  the terms of our strategic agreement with bank of america in october called for us to provide million toward a two year  million marketing campaign to be administered by bank of america 
because we had no direct influence or control over the specific nature  timing or extent of the use of funds  we expensed the million as a period cost in the quarter ended december  net of this one time charge  sales and marketing costs were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june  fiscal year commission expenses were lower than prior year due to lower overall software sales and lower biller signings than in the prior year 
we reduced the number of i solutions sales and marketing staff in the quarter ended june  and sales and marketing staff across the company were also impacted by the reduction in force announced on march  because our electronic billing and payment services are offered as a private labeled service through our bank customers  we do not incur the cost of direct advertising and promotion campaigns 
however  our existing marketing staff provided assistance to our consumer service provider customers in identifying best practice programs that were successful in driving increased subscriber adoption and activation 
general and administrative 
our general and administrative costs were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june   and were million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june  our general and administrative costs as a percentage of revenue continued to decline due to leverage inherent in our business model and efforts to curtail discretionary spending in a recessionary economy throughout fiscal depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization costs increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the significant depreciation and amortization costs relative to the other costs of our business are composed primarily of amortization expenses related to the intangible assets we recorded as a result of the acquisition of bluegill technologies in april  the acquisition of transpoint in september  and our purchase of the electronic billing and payment assets of bank of america in october net of intangible amortization from acquisitions  our depreciation costs related primarily to fixed assets used in ongoing operations  increased from million for the year ended june  to million for the year ended june  the increase in fixed asset depreciation was the result of continued capital spending for data processing equipment  related software  and facility improvements in support of the continued growth of the business 
as a result of our decision to close our san francisco  houston and austin offices  we had certain fixed assets that had no future use to us  and we accelerated the remaining depreciation on those assets to reduce their book value to zero to reflect the timing of the office closings and their resulting shorter useful life 
in process research and development 
in the three months ended september   we incurred million of in process research and development costs in relation to our acquisition of transpoint 
for a detailed discussion of this charge  please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in our june  annual report 
impairment of intangible assets 
in the quarter ended december   we recorded charges totaling million for the impairment of intangible assets 
as previously explained  this was the combined result of a charge of million for the impairment of goodwill associated with our acquisition of bluegill technologies in april currently referred to as checkfree i solutions  and of million for the retirement of certain technology assets we acquired from transpoint in september reorganization charge 
we previously discussed our fiscal reorganization charge of million in the years ended june  and section of this report 
please refer back to the reorganization charge caption for a full discussion of the charges 
interest 
interest income decreased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the decrease is a result of the combined effect of a decrease in our average annual yield  offset by an increase in our average invested assets of million 
interest expense declined from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the decrease is due to a modest drop in average interest rates combined with a reduction in our average outstanding debt and other long term obligations of approximately million 
note that the interest rate on our million convertible debt balance is fixed at and this debt has remained in place throughout fiscal and fiscal loss on investments 
due to overall market conditions  certain of our investments incurred an other than temporary decline in market value 
as a result  in the year ended june   we recorded charges of million to appropriately reflect the decline in value of these investments 
no additional charge was required in the year ended june  income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million  at an effective rate of  for the year ended june   and an income tax benefit of million  at an effective rate of  for the year ended june  the reported effective rates differ from the blended statutory rate of in all periods due to certain non deductible goodwill amortization  impairment charges related to goodwill  non deductible in process research and development expenses and other non deductible expenses  offset somewhat by eligible tax credits

revenue in our electronic commerce business increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  in the quarter ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million against electronic commerce revenue associated with the probable vesting of warrants we issued to a third party 
the warrants vested in the quarter ended september   and at that time  we recorded a true up of million which reduced the original charge 
net of this one time charge and its subsequent true up  underlying revenue in electronic commerce increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the increase in revenue is driven primarily by an increase in year over year transaction volume 
at the end of our fiscal year  we introduced transaction based metrics designed to help investors better understand trends in our business 
we offer two levels of electronic billing and payment services to our customers 
customers that utilize our full service offering generally outsource their electronic billing and payment process to us 
for instance  a full service customer might not use a checkfree hosted user interface  but still use our full array of services  including payment processing  claims processing  e bill  on line proof of payment  customer care  and other aspects of our service 
also  while a full service customer might build its own payment warehouse  we maintain a customer record and payment history within our payment warehouse to support the full service customer s servicing needs 
customers in the full service category may contract to pay us either on a per subscriber basis  a per transaction basis  or a combination of both 
customers that utilize our payment services offering receive a limited subset of our electronic billing and payment services 
an example of a payment services customer may be a bank that uses checkfree primarily to process its payments 
while we maintain payment records necessary to answer payment inquiries  in this situation we would not maintain full subscriber or payment initiation data in our payment warehouse 
additionally  within payment services  we provide services to billers who compensate us for electronic bill delivery and hosting services  as well as other payment services such as account balance transfer 
a third category of revenue we simply refer to as other electronic commerce 
other electronic commerce includes our health and fitness business and other ancillary revenue sources  such as csp and biller implementation and consulting services 
the following tables provide a historical trend of revenue  underlying transaction metrics  and subscriber metrics where appropriate  for the electronic commerce business quarter ended in thousands fiscal full service revenue     active subscribers     transactions processed     payment services revenue     transactions processed     other electronic commerce revenue     non cash revenue impact of warrants quarter ended in thousands fiscal full service revenue     active subscribers     transactions processed     payment services revenue     transactions processed     other electronic commerce revenue     non cash revenue impact of warrants  we experienced generally steady growth in full service revenue  active subscribers  and transactions processed until the september   quarter 
during the quarter ended september   one of our larger customers  wells fargo  converted from full service to payment services  and  accordingly  approximately  active subscribers and their related transactions switched categories 
although payment services transactions generate less revenue per transaction  because we provide less service  our cost per transaction is less as well 
while the shift of a customer to payment services from full service will reduce revenue  we do not expect such a shift to have a significant impact on our operating margin over time 
although bank of america accounts for over one third of our active full service subscribers  growth in active subscribers and transactions processed are the result of broad growth throughout the channel 
csp customer pricing in this category can be based on transactions processed  the number of subscribers  or a combination of both  and additionally  in order to share the benefits associated with scale efficiencies  pricing is tiered in nature  whereby a customer exceeding predetermined volumes is eligible for a lower price on a going forward basis 
in addition  the mix of customers utilizing transaction based versus subscriber based pricing will have an impact on revenue per transaction 
in the latter half of the quarter ended december   and again in the early part of the quarter ended june   bank of america reached pricing tier discount levels  and we expect it to reach a third pricing tier discount sometime late in the calendar year  or early in the quarter ending march  because of the significance of our relationship with bank of america  when it reaches a pricing tier discount  the implied revenue per transaction in this category will decline accordingly 
additionally  we saw reductions in subscribers and or transactions from full service customers wachovia and bank one throughout the second half of fiscal  and we expect bank one to take a significant volume of its transactions in house in the quarter ended september  we experienced moderate quarterly growth in revenue and transactions processed in the payment services category throughout fiscal  a significant increase in the quarter ended september   followed by a declining revenue trend beginning in the quarter ended december  as previously mentioned  wells fargo converted from a full service relationship to a payment services relationship  which caused the significant increase in revenue and transactions in this category 
we had anticipated that jp morgan chase  another large customer already included in the payment services category  would begin moving transactions to a competitor in order to meet contractually guaranteed minimum transaction levels with that competitor 
this shift did not take place as quickly as expected  but by december   all of jp morgan chase s non pfm volume was moved off our system 
we started to see signs of the anticipated drop in transactions processed from wells fargo in the quarters ended march  and june   as they also are required to meet guaranteed minimum transaction levels with a competitor 
we expect to experience a significant reduction in transactions from wells fargo in the quarter ended september  wells fargo  however  is e bill enabled and their in house system is integrated with our processing system 
all electronic bills that we present to wells fargo customers  at a minimum  will be routed back to us for payment purposes 
we delivered million bills in the year ended june   almost three times the million bills delivered in the year ended june  we also report miscellaneous payment only transactions from complementary products such as our account balance transfer business in this category 
pricing in our account balance transfer business is interest sensitive  whereby we share inherent float from the product with our customers 
fluctuations in prevailing interest rates will therefore have an impact on the average revenue per transaction we will receive and  as a result  the drop in interest rates over the past year has had a dampening effect on our revenue and revenue per transaction during fiscal our other electronic commerce revenue includes our health and fitness product  which grew modestly  and other non transaction related services such implementation and consulting  which increased on a quarter over quarter basis 
we expect one of our largest health and fitness customers to migrate to an internally developed health club management system beginning in the quarter ending september  we expect this to result in an immediate decline in quarterly revenue in this category of about million 
during the quarter ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million against electronic commerce revenue associated with the probable vesting of warrants we issued to a third party 
in the quarter ended september   the warrants actually vested 
on the date of vesting  however  the fair value of our stock was lower than when we calculated the initial charge 
as a result  a true up of the value of the warrants resulted in a credit to revenue of million in the quarter ended september  operating income in our electronic commerce business  net of purchase accounting amortization  intangible asset impairment charges  reorganization charges  and the impact of warrants  has improved from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  our ratio of electronic payments to total payments continues to improve  from approximately as of june   to over as of june  electronic payments carry a significantly lower variable cost per unit than paper payments and are far less likely to result in a costly customer care inquiry or claim 
the full underlying impact of improved efficiency and quality  however  is not fully explained by a change in electronic rate 
throughout fiscal  we supported two additional payment processing platforms over and above our genesis platform 
we paid bank of america to run the legacy bank of america platform through march  as we migrated consumers onto our more efficient genesis platform  and cleared outstanding customer care claims initiated on the bank of america platform 
by march   we eliminated this redundant payment platform and were able to close our san francisco customer care facility in april and our houston customer care facility by june in addition  we had been operating a legacy austin payment processing platform 
when all but a few csps had migrated onto genesis by june  we were able to close our austin facility as well 
in march  we announced a corporate wide reorganization that resulted in a reduction in workforce  over and above the employees impacted by office closings and platform consolidation 
in total  we eliminated between million and million of quarterly costs starting in the quarter ended june  finally  we continue to emphasize quality improvement  which we expect to result in further reduction in cost per transaction as we leverage the fixed costs already invested in our electronic commerce business 
our focus in electronic commerce in fiscal and into has been toward improved profitability through programs designed to drive increased consumer adoption and activation among our partners  improve product design and usability  improve overall customer satisfaction  and reduce variable costs per transaction 
investment services 
revenue in our investment services business increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the total number of portfolios managed has remained relatively flat at approximately million on a year over year basis 
current revenue growth has not matched historical performance as the depressed stock market has had a direct impact on our ability to grow revenue in the business 
our pricing is based primarily on portfolios managed and portfolio additions continue to be offset by investors reducing stock holdings 
we have focused attention on leveraging our economies of scale leadership position to secure multi year contract extensions with certain customers 
as a result  although we are starting to see signs of portfolio growth  we anticipate experiencing similar growth into fiscal until the stock market improves 
operating income in investment services  net of purchase accounting amortization  has decreased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the decline in operating income is due to investment spending on new product offerings and quality improvement initiatives in anticipation of a positive turn in the economy 
throughout fiscal  key initiatives in our investment services business have included new product offerings eg  multiple strategy portfolios m pact with a shortened time to market  additional web based products with increased functionality and ease of use  build out of relationship based service offerings in our operations  and investments to improve quality 
software 
revenue in our software business increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the downturn in the economy throughout fiscal and has caused many businesses to curtail discretionary expenditures  which has resulted in an overall dampening of demand for licensed software solutions 
while our newer i solutions electronic statement and billing software has been impacted most  short term demand for our reconciliation and ach processing licenses has been impacted as well 
however  during the quarter ended december   we began work on a consulting services agreement with a large bank customer in our ach business unit that provided greater than normal consulting revenue over the past two quarters 
resulting services revenue was the driving factor behind growth in the software segment 
we believe software license sales in general will continue to be somewhat challenging until economic conditions improve 
operating income in our software business  net of purchase accounting amortization  intangible asset impairment charges and reorganization charges  has increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  in march  we announced a company wide reorganization that resulted in a net reduction in staff 
as part of these actions  we announced the closing of our ann arbor  michigan office 
in addition to the recurring savings that resulted from these actions  improvements in operating income are also the result of continued efforts to closely manage discretionary expenses in light of economic conditions 
corporate 
our corporate segment represents expenses for legal  human resources  finance and other various unallocated overhead expenses 
in corporate  we incurred operating expenses of million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june   and operating expenses of million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june  we continue to closely manage our expenses  resulting in expected leverage in overhead costs 
purchase accounting amortization 
the purchase accounting amortization line represents amortization of intangible assets resulting from all of our various acquisitions from forward 
the total amount of purchase accounting amortization has decreased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  in july  we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
instead  goodwill is subject to at least an annual assessment for possible impairment 
all other intangible assets  such as acquired technology  strategic agreements  trade names  and the like  will continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
for comparative purposes  the following table breaks out the intangible asset amortization by segment year ended june  in thousands electronic commerce    investment services    software    total    impairment of intangible assets 
in the quarter ended june   we recorded charges totaling million for the impairment of intangible assets 
our annual review for possible impairment of goodwill as required by sfas resulted in a charge of million for the impairment of our customer base intangible asset and another million for the impairment of goodwill  both from intangible assets we established upon the acquisition of bluegill technologies in april currently referred to as checkfree i solutions 
in the quarter ended december   we recorded charges totaling million for the impairment of intangible assets 
this was the combined result of a charge of million for the impairment of goodwill associated with our acquisition of bluegill technologies and of million for the retirement of certain technology assets we acquired from transpoint in september please refer to impairment of intangible assets in the years ended and results of operations section of this report for a detailed explanation of these charges 
reorganization charge 
in january  we announced our plans to close our customer care facility in san francisco  california  effective april   which resulted in the termination of employees at that facility 
at that time we also announced our intent to eliminate certain of our financial planning products within our investment services division  which also resulted in a small reduction of employees in our raleigh  north carolina office 
in march  we further announced the closing of our houston  austin  ann arbor and singapore offices  along with a net reduction in force totaling approximately employees 
as a result of these actions  we incurred a charge of million in the quarter ended march   a true up charge of million in the quarter ended june   and a second true up charge of million in the quarter ended june  the first true up consisted primarily of severance and related employee benefits and lease termination fees 
the second true up of million was due primarily to our inability to sub lease vacated property as originally anticipated 
we accounted for these actions in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf abstract number  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity 
the following table provides a breakdown of our reorganization charges by segment year ended june  in thousands electronic commerce  investment services  software   corporate total   impact of warrants 
during the quarter ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million against revenue resulting from the probable vesting of warrants issued to a third party 
in the quarter ended september   the warrants vested 
on the date of vesting  however  the fair value of our stock was lower than at june   when we calculated the initial charge 
as a result  a true up of the value of the warrants resulted in a credit to revenue of million in the quarter ended september  the charge  and the true up credit  were based on a black scholes valuation of the warrants and were accounted for as a net charge to revenue in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf  accounting for consideration given by a vendor to a customer 
years ended june  and electronic commerce 
revenue in our electronic commerce business increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  in the quarter ended june   we recorded a non cash charge of million against electronic commerce revenue associated with the probable vesting of warrants we issued to a third party 
net of this one time non cash charge  underlying revenue was million for the year ended june   for an increase of 
underlying growth in this business is driven primarily by an increase in subscribers from just over million at june   to over million as of june   an increase of 
while significant  this growth rate was lower than we had seen in recent years due to a difficult economic environment 
with our acquisition of transpoint in september  we became the preferred provider of electronic billing and payment services to customers through microsoft s msn and money central product offerings 
the agreement with microsoft provides guaranteed revenue of million over a five year period that commenced in january additionally  as part of the transpoint acquisition  we received million of guaranteed revenue and or cost savings opportunities through first data corporation over a five year period that began in september effective october   we completed a strategic agreement with bank of america  the largest bank in the united states  to offer electronic billing and payment services to its customer base 
this ten year agreement provides annual revenue guarantees of million  or million on a quarterly basis 
we had been processing certain transactions for bank of america prior to the strategic agreement and  therefore  the million guarantee was not entirely incremental to our underlying revenue 
however  we did add approximately  incremental subscribers to our subscriber base upon completion of the strategic agreement 
underlying revenue for each of these agreements had been below our guaranteed minimum level  until the quarter ended december   when bank of america exceeded their minimums 
when combining subscriber growth with guaranteed minimums  an increasing number of businesses opting for a transaction based pricing structure versus a traditional subscriber based pricing structure  other payment transactions which we effect  a couple of large banks that have built their own in house user interface and payment warehouse  an emerging electronic billing revenue stream  and volatile interest based revenue sources that fluctuate with interest rate changes  it became too difficult to correlate revenue solely to the number of subscribers  with transactions processed becoming a more meaningful indicator 
for the year ended june   we processed in excess of million transactions  compared to million processed for the year ended june  historically  we provided the total number of subscribers and total number of transactions processed on a quarterly basis 
underlying operating results in our electronic commerce business  excluding a non cash charge to revenue related to warrants  purchase accounting amortization  intangible asset impairment charges  in process research and development  a one time marketing charge and reorganization charges  have improved from an operating loss of million for the year ended june   to operating income of million for the year ended june  we continued to drive improved efficiency and processing quality within our genesis processing platform 
our ratio of electronic payments to total payments improved from as of june   to over as of june  electronic payments carry a significantly lower variable cost per unit than paper payments and are far less likely to result in a costly customer inquiry or claim 
we acquired transpoint in september and the electronic billing and payment assets of bank of america in october as a result of these transactions  we supported two additional billing and payment processing platforms for much of the year ended june   and one additional platform through march the acquired platforms were less efficient than our genesis processing platform and  therefore  much more expensive to operate 
during the year ended june   we incurred approximately million of expense to bank of america for their support of the bank of america processing platform 
we completed the conversion of the transpoint subscribers and billers onto genesis in the quarter ended june  we completed the conversion of the bank of america subscribers onto genesis in the quarter ended december  after processing the remaining pre conversion customer inquiries and claims during the quarter ended march   we retired the bank of america platform 
as a result of the successful conversion of bank of america subscribers to genesis and our ability to retire the bank of america platform  we announced the closing of our san francisco customer care facility effective april   and our houston customer care facility effective june  in march  we also announced an overall company reorganization that resulted in a net reduction in force of approximately employees across the company  including the closing of offices mentioned 
additionally  upon retirement of our legacy austin processing platform  we closed our austin  texas office during the quarter ended september  the combined impact of these various actions reduced our quarterly costs by approximately million to million starting in the quarter ended june  investment services 
revenue in our investment services business increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  growth in this business was due primarily to an increase in portfolios managed from more than million at june   to about million at june  much of the revenue growth occurred in fee based versus institutional accounts  mirroring the movement of the investment industry towards fee based products and away from the transactional commission based model 
the lower annual growth in both revenue and portfolios compared to prior periods is due primarily to the decline in economic conditions  particularly in the financial services sector  as well as industry consolidations  which have resulted in the loss of over  portfolios 
however  the majority of these portfolios possessed a much lower price point than average  based on the services provided  resulting in a reduced negative impact 
we completed a rationalization of our raleigh  north carolina office and discontinued our financial planning products during the year ended june   which had a modestly negative impact on revenue going forward 
during the quarter ended march   the division released two product offerings a new trading and reporting tool for multiple strategy portfolios  which was released to complement checkfree apl and the apl browser  which offers clients access via the internet to the division s portfolio accounting and reporting product  creating a highly visible new distribution channel for money managers and brokers 
operating income in our investment services segment  net of purchase accounting amortization and reorganization charges  increased by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  as previously indicated  much of our revenue growth has occurred in fee based versus institutional accounts that may carry a lower unit price  which in turn places downward pressure on margins as the cost to process this business is not proportionally lower 
we initiated a quality program that focuses attention on improved system reliability  particularly trading availability  which is critical to the business unit  and we enhanced our disaster recovery capabilities 
software 
revenue in our software business declined by million  or  from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the downturn in economic conditions in calendar that continued throughout fiscal caused many businesses to curtail discretionary expenditures  which resulted in an overall dampening of demand for software solutions 
to help address the economic concerns within our i solutions business unit  we released two new product offerings in fiscal i solutions select  which is a series of industry tailored packaged software choices at lower price points  and new options for billers to host economically priced electronic billing and payment services at checkfree  which streamlines implementation cycles and lowers costs to billers while delivering both biller direct and e bill distribution and payment across our network 
operating results in our software business  net of purchase accounting amortization  impairment of intangible assets and reorganization charges  improved from operating income of million for the year ended june   to operating income of million for the year ended june  improvement in operating results is primarily the result of continued efforts to manage discretionary costs in light of current economic conditions 
in march  we announced a company wide reorganization that resulted in a net reduction in force of approximately employees 
as part of these actions  we announced the closing of our ann arbor  michigan office 
as a result of this reorganization  we experienced a recurring savings in underlying costs in the quarter ended june  corporate 
our corporate segment incurred operating expenses of million  or of total revenue  for the year ended june   and of million  or over of total revenue  for the year ended june  although our total overhead expenses increased slightly  as a percentage of revenue they continue to improve  reflecting the leverage inherent in our business model 
in march  we announced a company wide reorganization 
however  we had been reducing corporate costs through attrition and discretionary cost management throughout the year and  therefore  we did not incur significant additional reductions in staff in this segment 
purchase accounting amortization 
the purchase accounting amortization line represents amortization of intangible assets resulting from all of our various acquisitions from forward 
the total amount of purchase accounting amortization has increased from million for the year ended june   to million for the year ended june  the increase is the result of intangible assets established by the acquisitions of transpoint in september and the purchase of the electronic billing and payment assets of bank of america in october  offset by shorter term intangible assets that fully amortized in the quarter ended december   and the decline in amortization expense resulting from the intangible asset impairment charge we recorded in the quarter ended december  one time marketing charge 
the one time marketing charge took place in the three month period ended december  our strategic agreement with bank of america called for us to provide million of cash at closing to help support an agreed upon two year million marketing campaign by bank of america 
because we had no direct influence or impact on the specific nature  timing or extent of the use of the funds  we expensed the million as a period cost in the quarter ended december  because we do not typically market directly to subscribers  we segregated this charge from ongoing operations as a one time event 
in process research and development 
in the three month period ended september   we incurred million of in process research and development costs in relation to our acquisition of transpoint 
for a detailed discussion of this charge  please refer to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in our june   annual report 
liquidity and capital resources the following chart provides a summary of our consolidated statements of cash flows for the appropriate periods year ended june  in thousands cash flow provided by used in operating activities   cash flow used in investing activities    cash flow provided by used in financing activities    net increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    as of june   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments on hand  and an additional million in long term investments 
our balance sheet reflects a current ratio of and working capital of million 
due to process efficiency improvement initiatives  the retirement of redundant processing platforms and the restructuring actions we initiated during fiscal  we have seen a significant increase in operating cash flow 
due to state and federal operating loss and credit carryforwards  we do not expect to incur other than alternative minimum taxes for up to two more years 
as a result  when combined with existing balances  we believe we have sufficient cash to meet our presently anticipated requirements for the foreseeable future 
our board of directors has approved up to million for the purpose of repurchasing shares of our common stock or repurchases of our convertible debt between now and august at this time  no such repurchases have taken place 
as of june   we had a million line of credit facility  which we later cancelled in anticipation of obtaining a new line of credit facility 
there were no outstanding balances on the original line of credit as of june  or for the year ended june   we generated million of cash from operating activities 
we typically have a seasonally low september quarter due to the payout of annual incentive bonuses and commissions related to seasonally high sales from the previous quarter  and as a result  we expect operating cash flow to be relatively low in the quarter ended september   but as a result of efforts to improve efficiency  we have been able to generate an increasing amount of cash from operating activities and we believe this trend will continue into fiscal from an investing perspective  we used million of cash for the year ended june  of this amount  million was used for the net purchase of investments and another million was used for the purchase of property and equipment 
the remaining million is the net of a million use of cash for the capitalization of software development costs  offset by million in proceeds from the sale of fixed assets 
none of these items are significantly different from what we incurred in fiscal  when we used million of cash in investing activities 
we expect to spend approximately million on purchases of property and equipment for the coming fiscal year 
from a financing perspective  we used million of cash for the year ended june  we used million for principal payments under capital leases and other long term obligations 
we received million in combined proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the purchase of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
while the timing of cash payments and collections can cause fluctuations from quarter to quarter and the level of expected capital expenditures could change  we expect to generate as much as million of free cash flow for the fiscal year ending june  we define free cash flow as cash flow from operating activities less capital expenditures 
the following table represents a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments over the next several years which provides added information in understanding expected cash commitments from various obligations we have entered into over time payments due year ended june  to to contractual obligations total thereafter in thousands long term debt   capital lease obligations    operating leases      other long term obligations    total contractual cash obligations      recent accounting pronouncements on july   the fasb issued sfas  business combinations and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires all business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
in addition  it requires application of the provisions of sfas for goodwill and other intangible assets related to any business combinations completed after june   but prior to the adoption date of sfas sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
upon adoption  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life 
rather  goodwill will be subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
all other acquired intangibles will be separately recognized if the benefit of the intangible asset is obtained through contractual or other legal rights  or if the intangible asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  or exchanged  regardless of the our intent to do so 
other intangibles will be amortized over their useful lives 
sfas became effective for us on july  and had the following impacts we reclassified approximately  million of unamortized workforce in place intangible assets  net of the associated deferred income taxes  into goodwill 
after the reclassification above  goodwill was no longer amortized 
we performed a transitional impairment test as of july  this impairment test requires us to identify its reporting units  determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units  and determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
if the carrying value of any reporting unit exceeds its fair value  then the amount of any goodwill impairment will be determined through a fair value analysis of each of the assigned assets excluding goodwill and liabilities 
we recorded a charge of  for impairment of goodwill associated with our i solutions reporting unit upon the adoption of sfas this charge is reflected as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended june  following the transitional impairment test  our goodwill balances are subject to annual impairment tests using the same process described above 
we will perform our annual evaluation under the requirements of sfas as of april of each year 
refer to footnote where the results of our annual impairment test are discussed 
in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated retirement costs 
we adopted sfas as of july  the adoption of this statement had no impact on our results of operations or financial position for the year ended june  on july   we adopted sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas superseded sfas  accounting for impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion  reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions for the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the initial adoption of sfas did not result in an impairment of any kind 
however  in conjunction with our annual test for impairment of goodwill as of april   follow up testing under sfas indicated a required impairment charge of million related to our customer base intangible asset that resulted from our acquisition of bluegill technologies  inc in april we recorded this impairment charge in the quarter ended june  in april  the fasb issued sfas  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement eliminates the current requirement that gains and losses on extinguishment of debt must be classified as extraordinary items in the income statement 
instead  the statement requires that gains and losses on extinguishment of debt be evaluated against the criteria in apb opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions to determine whether or not it should be classified as an extraordinary item 
in addition  the statement contains other corrections to authoritative accounting literature in sfas  and the changes in sfas related to debt extinguishment are effective for our fiscal year and the other changes were effective beginning with transactions after may  in august  we announced that our board of directors renewed its authorization of a repurchase program under which we may purchase up to million of shares of our common stock and convertible notes before august should we purchase any of our convertible notes and realize a gain or loss on the transaction  sfas will require us to evaluate the transaction against the criteria in apb opinion to determine if the gain or loss should be classified as an extraordinary item 
if classification as an extraordinary item is not appropriate  the gain or loss would be included as part of income before income taxes 
we have not purchased any of our convertible notes and  therefore  adoption of this statement has had no impact on our results of operations or financial position during our fiscal year 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for reorganization and similar costs 
sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of a company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect the timing of recognizing any future reorganization costs as well as the amount recognized 
the provisions of sfas were effective for reorganization activities initiated after december   and we have had no such material activities since that time 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements 
eitf addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
it also addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   with early application permitted 
companies may elect to report the change in accounting as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion  accounting changes and sfas  reporting accounting changes in interim financial statements an amendment of apb opinion no 

we believe that our current practices are consistent with the provisions of eitf and  therefore  expect no impact on our results of operations or financial position 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which provides alternative methods of transition for an entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas requires prominent disclosure about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation and amends apb opinion  interim financial reporting  to require disclosure about those effects in interim financial information 
we included the required disclosure  including comparisons to the same periods in the prior year  in the notes to interim condensed consolidated unaudited financial statements beginning with our quarter ended march  fin consolidation of variable interest entities vie was issued in january to address the consolidation issues around certain types of entities  including special purpose entities spe 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated if the company s variable interest ie  investment in the entity will absorb a majority of the entity s expected losses and or residual returns if they occur 
fin is applicable immediately to any vie formed after january  and must be applied beginning july  to any such entity created before february  we do not expect the implementation of fin to have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under statement  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june  we are in the process of evaluating any effects of this new statement 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  which establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  it is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
we do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have an impact on our results of operations and financial position 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
critical accounting policies are those policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe the policies and estimates described below relating to intangible assets  equity instruments issued to customers  and deferred income taxes are our critical accounting policies 
discussion with the audit committee of the board of directors 
in determining which of our accounting policies warranted disclosure as critical in nature  our senior financial management team prepared an analysis of our accounting policies and reviewed the policies in detail with our audit committee 
after discussing the level of management judgment required to comply with our accounting policies  we agreed with the audit committee that the following accounting policies are deemed to be critical in nature and should be disclosed as such 
accounting for goodwill 
over the past several years  we have acquired a number of businesses and the electronic billing and payment assets of bank of america  which resulted in significant goodwill balances 
as of june   the balance of goodwill on our balance sheet totaled million and is spread across our three business segments as follows electronic commerce of million  software of million  and investment services of million 
upon adoption of sfas  we were required to perform a transitional impairment test related to our goodwill balances 
we performed the test as of july  the impairment test requires us to identify our various reporting units  determine the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning assets and liabilities  including existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units  and determine the fair value of each reporting unit 
if we determine that the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  additional testing is required to see if the goodwill carried on the balance sheet is impaired 
depending on the nature of the non goodwill intangible asset in question  we will prepare a sfas analysis to test the recoverability of capitalized software  or a sfas analysis to test the recoverability of other non goodwill intangible assets 
any resulting impairments from the non goodwill intangible tests would be applied to the fair value balance sheet 
then  the amount of any goodwill impairment is determined through an analysis similar to that of a purchase price allocation  where the fair value of each of the tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill and liabilities is compared to the fair value of the reporting unit 
the fair value of goodwill is estimated using the residual method and compared to the carrying value of goodwill 
the amount of the goodwill impairment was equal to the carrying amount less the fair value of goodwill 
we determined two of our reporting units to correlate directly with our electronic commerce and our investment services business segments 
although our i solutions software reporting unit has the same operating characteristics of our other software reporting unit  because it is a fairly new product and therefore not as mature as our other software units  we split our software segment into two reporting units  i solutions software and cfacs ach software 
we applied significant judgment in determining the fair value of each of our reporting units as such an analysis includes projections of expected future cash flow related specifically to the reporting unit 
our projections included  but were not limited to  expectations of product sales and related revenues  cost of sales  and other operating expenses supporting the reporting unit five years into the future 
additionally  we estimated terminal values for the reporting units  which represented the present value of future cash flow beyond the five year period 
finally  we assumed a discount rate that we believed fairly represented the risk free rate and a risk premium appropriate for the reporting unit 
upon completion of this analysis  only one reporting unit  i solutions software  had a carrying value exceeding its fair value 
this indicated the possibility of goodwill impairment within the i solutions software reporting unit 
for our electronic commerce  investment services  and ach cfacs software reporting units  we determined that a fluctuation in our underlying value drivers  either positive or negative  would not have indicated a possible impairment in goodwill within the respective reporting unit that would have resulted in additional transition testing 
as a result of the possible impairment of the i solutions reporting unit goodwill  we took the next step in the transitional impairment test and assigned fair value to each of the individual assets and liabilities of the reporting unit 
we applied significant judgment in determining the fair value of each identified intangible asset as such an analysis includes projections of expected future cash flows related specifically to the intangible asset 
the fair value of the i solutions reporting unit was estimated using a combination of the cost  market  and income approaches 
specifically  the discounted cash flow and market multiples methodologies were utilized to determine the fair value of the reporting unit by estimating the present value of future cash flows of the reporting unit along with reviewing revenue and earnings multiples for comparable publicly traded companies and applying these to the reporting unit s projected cash flows 
fair value of each of the assigned assets and liabilities was determined using either a cost  market or income approach  as appropriate  for each individual asset or liability 
upon completion of the analysis  we determined the goodwill associated with the i solutions software reporting unit to be impaired by million and we recorded this charge as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the three month period ended september  we performed a sensitivity analysis and determined that a decrease in the underlying estimates driving the fair value of intangible assets would have increased the impairment charge to approximately million 
an increase of in the underlying estimates driving the fair value of intangible assets would have decreased the impairment charge to approximately million 
we completed our annual test for impairment of goodwill effective april  we used the same methodology in the annual test as we did in the prior transition review 
our initial testing again resulted in our electronic commerce  investment services  ach cfacs reporting units passing the original tests  but we noted another indicator of possible impairment with our remaining i solutions goodwill balance 
upon completion of our analysis  we determined our i solutions goodwill balance to be impaired by million  which we recorded in the quarter ended june  a positive or negative change in our estimated revenues would have had a  impact on the amount of the ultimate impairment charge 
intangible assets exclusive of goodwill 
over the past several years  we have acquired a number of businesses and the electronic billing and payment assets of bank of america  which resulted in significant non goodwill related intangible assets 
as of june   the balance of such intangible assets on our balance sheet totaled million and is spread across our three business segments as follows electronic commerce of million  software of million  and investment services of million 
we adopted sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets on july   which replaced sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of among other authoritative standards 
during the year ended june   there were no events that provided a reason to believe any of our non goodwill related intangible assets were impaired 
however  our annual test for the impairment of goodwill caused us to perform additional procedures to test the recoverability of intangible assets within our i solutions reporting unit 
we first tested for the recoverability of our capitalized software 
per the terms of sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased or otherwise marketed  we compared the undiscounted net realizable value for projected i solutions sales for the period representing the remaining useful life of the capitalized software intangible asset 
because the undiscounted net realizable value exceeded the carrying value of the asset  no impairment was indicated 
we then tested for impairment of all intangible assets other than goodwill and capitalized software under the terms of sfas the undiscounted cash flows from our i solutions projections was lower than the carrying value of our intangible assets and  as a result  we recorded a charge of million to write down to fair value our customer base asset  which was the only remaining intangible asset 
a swing in our cash flow projections  either up or down  would not have materially impacted the amount of the charge that we recorded 
through june   we evaluated our intangible assets for impairment whenever indicators of impairment existed 
sfas required that if the sum of the future cash flows expected to result from a company s asset  undiscounted and without interest charges  is less than the reported value of the asset  impairment must be recognized in the financial statements 
the amount of impairment to recognize is calculated by subtracting the fair value of the asset from the reported value of the asset 
in our software segment  we reviewed our i solutions intangible assets for impairment during the quarter ended december   due to a trend in lower than expected license sales during the extended recessionary economy 
we determined that the book value of intangible assets within i solutions exceeded the undiscounted sum of the expected future cash flows from the assets related to the i solutions business unit  which indicated that the intangible assets were impaired 
the actual amount of impairment was then determined by subtracting the fair value of the expected cash flows from the i solutions business unit from the related long lived assets 
as a result  in accordance with gaap  we recorded an impairment charge of million against the balance of i solutions goodwill in the quarter ended december  we applied judgment in developing projections of future cash flows from our i solutions business 
our projections included  but were not limited to  expectations of product sales and related future product maintenance revenues  cost of sales  and other operating expenses supporting this business five years into the future 
additionally  we estimated a terminal value  which represented the present value of future cash flow beyond the five year period 
finally  we assumed a discount rate that we believed fairly represented the risk free rate and a risk premium appropriate for this business 
variances from our projected cash flows  and the related terminal value  could have had a significant impact on the amount of the impairment charge we recorded 
if we had assumed a increase in our estimated annual cash flows from the i solutions business unit  we would have passed the sfas undiscounted cash flow test and not recorded an impairment charge at all 
if  however  we reduced our estimated annual cash flows for the i solutions business unit by  our impairment charge would have increased by approximately million 
in our electronic commerce segment  we reviewed our transpoint related technology assets for impairment during the quarter ended december   due to the termination of a maintenance agreement for this technology from the last of our international partners and an evaluation of the service potential of the related technology assets against our current and future initiatives 
we determined that there was no alternative future use for two of the technology assets  and in accordance with gaap  we recorded a charge of million to retire these assets 
the retirement of the transpoint technology assets was an indicator of potential impairment for other intangible assets associated with this acquisition 
sfas required us to test for impairment at the lowest level of separately identifiable cash flows  which we determined in this case  was our electronic commerce division 
we performed the initial impairment test by comparing the sum of expected future cash flows from the assets related to our electronic commerce division  on an undiscounted basis  to the book value of the electronic commerce division long lived assets 
because the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows exceeded the long lived assets book value  there was no impairment 
there were several areas of management judgment used in performing this analysis 
initially  our projections of future cash flow from the electronic commerce division required management s judgment regarding our expectations of future revenues  costs  and other operating expenses supporting this business five years into the future 
additionally  we estimated a terminal value  which represented the present value of future cash flow beyond the five year period 
finally  we assumed a discount rate that we believed fairly represented the risk free rate and a risk premium appropriate for this business 
variances  both positive and negative  from our projected cash flows  and the related terminal value  would not have had a significant impact on our analysis 
if we had assumed a increase in our estimated annual cash flows from the electronic commerce division  we would have simply passed the sfas undiscounted cash flow test by a greater margin 
if we had assumed a reduction in our estimated annual cash flows we still would have passed the undiscounted cash flow test  and therefore  still not incurred an impairment charge 
in january  we announced the intent to eliminate certain of our financial planning products within our investment services division 
the elimination of those products was an indicator of potential impairment for our long lived assets associated with that m solutions business unit within our investment services segment 
we determined that the lowest level of separately identifiable cash flows at which to test for impairment was our m solutions business unit 
we performed the initial impairment test by comparing the sum of expected future cash flows from the assets related to m solutions  on an undiscounted basis  to the book value of the m solutions division s long lived assets 
because the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows exceeded the long lived assets book value  there was no impairment 
as with our other analyses  there were several areas of management judgment used in performing this analysis such as our projections of future cash flows from this business  the estimated terminal value and the discount rate we used 
variances from our projected cash flows  and the related terminal value  would not have had a significant impact on our analysis 
if we had assumed a increase on our estimated annual cash flows from the m solutions business  we would have simply passed the sfas undiscounted cash flow test by a greater margin 
had we had assumed a reduction in our estimated annual cash flows  we still would have passed the undiscounted cash flow test and  therefore  still not incurred an impairment charge 
equity instruments issued to customers 
within our electronic commerce segment  from time to time  we have determined it appropriate to issue warrants to certain of our customers to provide an incentive for them to achieve mutually beneficial long term objectives 
these objectives can take the form of performance against long term growth targets  such as the number of the third party s customers that become active bill paying subscribers of our service or the number of bills distributed electronically to the third party s customers  or more relationship oriented  such as simply remaining a customer at a specified future date 
accounting standards for these types of warrants require us to record a charge when it becomes probable that the warrants will vest 
for milestone based warrants the amount of the charge would be the fair value of the portion of the warrants earned by the customer based on their progress towards achieving the milestone s required to vest in the warrants 
at each reporting date  we would determine the current fair value of the portion of the warrants previously earned and true up the charges previously recorded 
in addition  we would record a charge for the fair value of the additional portion of the warrants earned during that period  again based on the customer s progress towards the vesting milestones 
this would continue until the warrants vest  at which time a final fair value is determined and the charge is adjusted accordingly 
at the time we issued these warrants  accounting standards in place indicated that the charge for these type warrants be recorded as an expense 
since then  the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb issued eitf  accounting for consideration by a vendor to a customer including a reseller of the vendor s products 
this guidance became effective for financial statements issued after december   and is retroactively applied to existing equity instruments previously issued 
it requires that the charge for the fair value of these types of warrants be recorded against revenue up to the cumulative amount of revenue recognized for a customer instead of to expense as was previously the case 
management must use judgment in determining when the vesting of a warrant becomes probable 
as of june   we had million unvested warrants outstanding that could potentially result in significant charges against our revenue  two million of which expire in june and ten million of which expire in october deferred income taxes 
as of june   we have million of deferred income tax assets recorded on our balance sheet  million of which are recorded in the current asset section of our balance sheet  and million of which are netted against long term deferred tax liabilities  in accordance with gaap 
deferred income tax assets represent future tax benefits we expect to be able to apply against future taxable income  and consist primarily of net operating loss benefits carried forward to future periods 
our ability to utilize the deferred tax benefits is dependent upon our ability to generate future taxable income 
sfas  accounting for income taxes requires us to record a valuation allowance against any deferred income tax benefits that we believe may expire before we generate sufficient taxable income to use them 
if we were to record a deferred tax benefit valuation allowance  it would have the effect of increasing our tax expense thereby decreasing our net income and decreasing our deferred tax asset balance on our balance sheet 
we use current estimates of future taxable income to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
projecting our future taxable income requires us to use significant judgment regarding the expected future revenues and expenses in each of our business segments 
in addition  we must assume that tax laws will not change sufficiently enough to materially impact the expected tax liability associated with our expected taxable income 
while our current projections indicate we will be able to fully utilize our deferred income tax benefits  should the economic recession continue for an extended period of time  or competitive pressures or other business risks result in a significant variance to our projected taxable income  we could be required to record a valuation allowance up to the full value of our deferred tax asset balances

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk with the acquisition of bluegill in april  we obtained operations in canada and have opened an office in the united kingdom 
as a result  we have assets and liabilities outside the united states that are subject to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
due to the early stage of each of these operations  however  we currently utilize the us dollar as the functional currency for all international operations 
as these operations begin to generate sufficient cash flow to satisfy for their own cash flow requirements  we will convert to local currency as the functional currency in each related operating unit as appropriate 
because we utilize the us dollar as the functional currency and due to the immaterial nature of the amounts involved  our economic exposure from fluctuations in foreign exchange rates is not significant enough at this time to engage in forward foreign exchange and other similar instruments 
while our international sales represented less than of our revenue for the year ended june   we now market  sell and license our products throughout the world 
as a result  our future revenue could be somewhat affected by weak economic conditions in foreign markets that could reduce demand for our products 
our exposure to interest rate risk is limited to the yield we earn on invested cash  cash equivalents and investments and interest based revenue earned on products such as our account balance transfer business 
our convertible debt carries a fixed rate  as do any outstanding capital lease obligations 
although our investment policy currently prohibits the use of derivatives for trading or hedging purposes  we believe that our limited interest rate risk currently does not warrant the use of such instruments
