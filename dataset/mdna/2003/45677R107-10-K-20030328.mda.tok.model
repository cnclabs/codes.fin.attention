overview inforte is a customer and demand management consultancy that helps clients improve customer interactions  revenue forecasting and profitability 
inforte creates strategies and implements technology solutions that enhance visibility  optimize customer and channel profitability  and integrate demand information with supply and resource planning processes 
inforte has applied a client advocacy approach and rigorous delivery methodologies to help garner references from percent of its global client base 
founded in  inforte is headquartered in chicago and has offices in atlanta  dallas  london  los angeles  new york and san francisco 
the majority of our revenue historically is from professional services performed on a fixed price basis  however  we also perform services on a time and materials basis 
typically  the first portion of an engagement involves a strategy project or a discovery phase lasting to days  which we perform on a fixed price basis 
this work enables us to determine with our clients the scope of successive phases for design and implementation  which in total generally last three to nine months  and to decide whether we will perform these additional phases for a fixed price or on a time and materials basis 
whether we use fixed pricing or time and material pricing depends upon our assessment of the project s risk  how precisely our clients are able to define the scope of activities they wish us to perform and client preference 
fixed prices are based on estimates from senior personnel in our consulting organization who project the length of the engagement  the number of people required to complete the engagement and the skill level and billing rates of those people 
we then adjust the fixed price based on various qualitative risk factors such as the aggressiveness of the delivery deadline  the technical complexity of the solution and the value of the solution delivered to the client 
we typically ask clients to pay of our fixed price projects in advance to enable us to secure a project team in a timeframe that is responsive to the client s needs 
we typically bill the remainder in advance of the work

 as a percentage of net revenue revenue before reimbursements net revenue operating expenses project personnel and related expenses sales and marketing recruiting  retention and training management and administrative total operating expenses operating income loss interest income  net  and other income before income taxes income tax expense benefit net income years ended december  and net revenue 
net revenue excludes reimbursable expenses that are billed to our clients 
net revenue decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we attribute this decline in net revenue to the slow growth rate of the us economy and the negative impact that economic uncertainty has had on information technology it spending 
these factors have depressed the market for strategic technology services over the last months 
for the year ended december   we had significant clients with each of these clients contributing million to net revenue on average 
we had significant clients during the year ended december   each contributing million to net revenue on average 
we have not had a client accounting for more than of our net revenue since project personnel and related expenses 
project personnel and related expenses consist primarily of compensation and benefits for our professional employees who deliver consulting services and non reimbursable project costs 
all labor costs for project personnel are included in project personnel and related expenses 
project personnel and related expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the decrease results from reductions in consulting headcount 
we employed and consultants on december  and  respectively 
further  project personnel and related expenses declined due to a  reduction in the allowance for doubtful accounts during our allowance for doubtful accounts was million as of december   compared to million as of december  the revised allowance for doubtful accounts balance more accurately reflects our exposure to loss from non paying customers  due to an overall reduction in business activity 
this reduction was not due to any write off of a specific customer account 
project personnel and related expenses represented of net revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this decrease is due to consulting headcount declining at a faster rate than the rate of net revenue decline 
net revenue per consultant was  in the year ended december   up from  in the year ended december  the increase in net revenue per consultant versus the prior year results from higher consultant utilization as excess consulting capacity was reduced  offset slightly by a small decline in our effective hourly rate in june inforte offered a six to nine month voluntary leave of absence program and a voluntary resignation program to employees in underutilized areas 
approximately people participated in the programs 
individuals who selected the leave of absence program received compensation at of regular pay if they remained available to return to full time service 
individuals who chose the voluntary resignation package received pay through the end of august all costs related to resigning employees were included either in our june quarter results or our september quarter results 
salary costs for employees on leave of absence were expensed as incurred and included in the quarters ended september through june with the amounts declining in the later quarters 
in october and in january  inforte again offered voluntary programs similar to the june program  however these latter programs were smaller in scope  involving approximately and people  respectively 
in the fourth quarter  inforte enacted a further headcount reduction program  affecting approximately individuals 
all costs for this program were expensed in fourth quarter sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and travel costs for employees in the market development and practice development groups and costs to execute marketing programs 
sales and marketing and expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in this decrease is due to lower headcount in this area  resulting in lower salary and benefit costs and a decrease in travel expense 
total sales and marketing headcount was as of december   as of december  and as of december  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue was stable in at versus in recruiting  retention and training 
recruiting  retention and training expenses consist of compensation  benefits  and travel costs for personnel engaged in human resources  costs to recruit new employees  costs of human resources programs  and training costs 
recruiting  retention and training expenses decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in spending is due primarily to less training activity due to lower company wide headcount and reduced headcount for employees engaged in recruiting  retention and training 
total employees declined from as of december  to as of december  to as of december  total recruiting retention and training headcount was as of december   as of december  and as of december  also  in the current economic environment of higher unemployment  recruiting efforts require fewer expenses  such as recruiting finder fees  signing bonuses  relocation allowances and employee referral bonuses to identify and attract qualified candidates 
recruiting  retention and training expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased to for the year ended december  from in management and administrative 
management and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation  benefits and travel costs for management  finance  information technology and facilities personnel  together with rent  telecommunications  audit  legal  business insurance  and depreciation and amortization of capitalized computers  purchased software and property 
management and administrative expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in for the year ended december   management and administrative expenses increased as a percent of revenue to from in the prior year period  as net revenue declined at a greater rate than management and administrative expenses 
during some management and administrative areas had lower expenses relative to  while other areas had higher expenses 
expense reductions related primarily to lower headcount and lower facilities costs 
total management and administrative headcount declined from as of december  to as of december  and as of december  lease expense in is lower than lease expense in due to a write down of million in for abandoned lease space which we are currently working to sublet 
the charge was determined based on future lease obligations less estimated sublease income 
during we recorded an additional charge of million to lease expense as our estimate of sublease income has decreased due to a reduction in the rental price of office space 
offsetting the overall reduction in management and administrative salary expense were increased costs for variable executive compensation resulting from improved operating income  severance costs related to senior management terminations and start up costs for new practice areas 
business insurance costs also increased significantly 
interest income  net and other 
during the year ended december   interest income  net and other decreased million  or to million 
the decrease was due to the reinvestment of matured securities into similar type securities at lower market interest yields and also due to the lower average cash balances as a result of inforte s stock buyback program 
income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was of pre tax income versus income tax expense of of pre tax income in the unusually high tax rate for results primarily from expenses not deductible for income tax purposes including the non cash  non recurring stock compensation expense 
excluding the non cash  non recurring stock compensation expense  effective income tax expense was of pre tax income in the decrease of the tax rate in versus  excluding the non cash  non recurring stock compensation expense  reflects the adjustment of certain estimates for non deductible expenses and state and internal tax obligations 
this decrease is partially offset by the tax effect of having less interest income from tax exempt and tax advantaged investments 
the income tax expense was the sum of a operating income times a combined federal and state tax rate and b interest income  net and other times a reduced tax rate of 
years ended december  and net revenues 
net revenue excludes reimbursable expenses that are billed to our clients 
net revenue decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  we attribute this decline in net revenue to the us recession in and the negative impact that heightened economic uncertainty had on information technology spending 
for the year ended december   we had significant clients with each of these clients contributing million to net revenue on average 
we had significant clients during the year ended december   each contributing million to net revenue on average 
we have not had a client accounting for more than of our net revenue since on a quarterly basis in  revenue followed typical seasonal patterns with higher sequential growth during the first half of this pattern did not hold in  however  as revenue declined sequentially each quarter due to the us recession and the technology spending slowdown 
project personnel and related expenses 
project personnel and related expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december   from million for year ended december  the decrease results from reductions in consulting headcount  primarily in the third quarter of we employed and consultants on december  and  respectively 
further  project personnel and related expenses declined in as there was no expense to increase the allowance for doubtful account in in  due to increased business activity  we increased the allowance for doubtful accounts from million as of december  to million as of december   resulting in  of project personnel and related expenses in that were not present in project personnel and related expenses represented of net revenue for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  this increase is due to net revenue declining at a higher rate than the rate of expense declines 
net revenue per consultant was  in the year ended december   down from  in the year ended december  the decline in net revenue per consultant versus the prior year results primarily from lower consultant utilization and secondarily from a slightly lower effective hourly rate due to more price sensitivity in the consulting market 
in june inforte offered a six to nine month voluntary leave of absence program and a voluntary resignation program to employees in underutilized areas 
approximately people participated in the programs 
individuals who selected the leave of absence program received compensation at of regular pay if they remained available to return to full time service 
individuals who chose the voluntary resignation package received pay through the end of august all costs related to resigning employees were included either in our june quarter results or our september quarter results 
salary costs for employees on leave of absence were expensed as incurred and included in the quarters ended september and december in october  inforte again offered voluntary programs similar to the june program  however this program was smaller in scope  involving approximately people 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  from million in factors causing the spending decrease include lower sales bonuses because of lower revenue during the year  reduced market development spending in by our partners resulting in less co marketing expenses related to those partnerships  and lower spending on discretionary marketing activities 
these decreases were partially offset by a higher average number of commissioned salespeople in compared to sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased to for the year ended december  from in recruiting  retention and training 
recruiting  retention and training expenses decreased by million or to million for the year ended december  from million in the year of the decrease in spending is due primarily to reduced recruiting activities and the lower costs associated with recruiting finder fees  signing bonuses  relocation allowances  employee referral bonuses and candidate travel 
other factors causing spending to decline include less spending on company wide meetings and other employee events and less training activity due to lower headcount and fewer new hires 
as a percentage of net revenue  recruiting  retention and training dropped to in from in management and administrative 
management and administrative expense increased to million in from million in for the year ended december   management and administrative expenses increased as a percent of net revenue to from in the prior year period  as revenue declined and expenses increased slightly 
we reduced spending in most departments in additionally  executive bonus compensation was lower in these declines  however  were offset by costs associated with our effort to consolidate office space at the chicago location where inforte had multiple contractual rental commitments 
estimated costs for the consolidation of facilities consist of contractual rental commitments for office space being vacated and related costs in addition to future depreciation of the related leasehold improvements  offset by estimated sub lease income 
the total charge related to this reduction of office space in was million 
interest income  net and other 
during the year ended december   interest income  net and other was million  similar to the amount in the year ended december  the negative effect of lower interest rates in was offset by the higher average cash and marketable securities balances we maintained in as compared to income tax expense 
income tax expense for the year ended december  was of pre tax income versus income tax expense of of pre tax income in this unusually high tax rate for results primarily from expenses not deductible for income tax purposes including the non cash  non recurring stock compensation expense 
excluding the non cash  non recurring stock compensation expense  effective income tax expense was of pre tax income in the decrease of the tax rate  excluding the non cash  non recurring stock compensation expense  in versus reflects the increase in tax free and tax advantaged investment earnings as a percentage of total pre tax book income 
liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  short term marketable securities decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  long term marketable securities decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  short term and long term marketable securities are available for sale securities consisting of commercial paper  us government or municipal notes and bonds  corporate bonds and corporate auction preferreds 
in total  cash and cash equivalents  short term and long term marketable securities decreased from million to million during the quarter ended december  during  inforte s cash flow from operations was positive million and capital expenditures were million  resulting in million of positive free cash flow cash flow from operation minus capital expenditures 
financing activities resulted in a cash outflow of million  resulting from million used for stock repurchases and received from employees participating in stock purchase and stock option plans 
in january  inforte announced that the board of directors approved a stock repurchase program that allows inforte to buy up to million of inforte shares 
the program was completed in august the board of directors approved an additional million stock repurchase program on august  we stated at that time that we had no present plans to make additional repurchases of stock  and as of december   we have made no repurchases under this second program 
on december   inforte had  shares outstanding and million in cash and marketable securities  resulting in of cash and marketable securities per basic share 
as of december   the public float shares not held by executive officers and directors totaled million shares or of total outstanding shares 
inforte believes that its current cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities will be sufficient to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements for the foreseeable future 
all highly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less when purchased are considered cash equivalents 
cash and cash equivalent balances consist of obligations of us and us banks  high grade commercial paper and other high quality  short term obligations of us companies 
short term and long term marketable securities are available for sale securities that are recorded at fair market value 
the difference between amortized cost and fair market value  net of tax effect  is shown as a separate component of stockholders equity 
the cost of securities available for sale is adjusted for amortization of premiums and discounts to maturity 
interest and amortization of premiums and discounts for all securities are included in interest income 
inforte has several operating leases that have contractual cash obligations for future payments 
there are no other contractual obligations that require future cash obligations or other commitments 
the table below identifies all future commitments 
payments due by period contractual obligations total in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations    critical accounting policies revenue recognition  losses on fixed price contracts  deferred revenue 
we recognize revenue when all of the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence exists that we have an agreement  service has been rendered  our price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we recognize net revenue from fixed price contracts based on the ratio of hours incurred to total estimated hours 
the cumulative impact of any change in estimated hours to complete is reflected in the period in which the changes become known 
we recognize time and materials net revenue as we perform the services 
reimbursed expenses 
in november  the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issued topic  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred stating these costs should be characterized as revenue in the income statement if billed to customers 
for each quarter beginning with the march  quarter  we included reimbursable expenses in revenue and expense and we have reclassified prior periods in the comparative consolidated financial statements as required by the financial accounting standards board 
this reclassification had no effect on current or previously reported net income loss per share 
for presentation purposes  we show two components of total revenue revenue before reimbursements  which we call net revenue  consisting of revenue for performing consulting services  and reimbursements  consisting of reimbursements we receive from clients for out of pocket expenses incurred 
we believe net revenue is a more meaningful representation of our economic activity than total revenue since it excludes pass through  zero margin expense reimbursements 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts is maintained for potential credit losses 
the amount of the reserve is established analyzing all client accounts to determine credit risk 
in establishing a client s creditworthiness we consider whether the client has a deteriorating or poor financial condition  limited financial resources  poor or no payment history  a large relative accounts receivable balance or a non us location 
stock compensation 
at december   inforte has three stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in footnote of the consolidated financial statements 
we account for stock based employee compensation in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and have adopted the disclosure only provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation sfas related to options issued to employees 
all options granted under our plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
bonus accruals 
we have several bonus programs that are based on individual and company performance 
revenue bonuses are earned based on individual or roll up revenue credit assigned to salespeople  client executives  other senior delivery personnel and senior management 
margin bonuses are earned by all employees based on company or business unit operating income performance 
in addition  senior management may award discretionary bonuses 
all of these bonuses are expensed in the period in which they are earned 
a corresponding accrual is included on the balance sheet in accrued expenses until the bonus is paid 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  which requires the recognition of deferred income taxes based upon the tax consequences of temporary differences between financial reporting and income tax reporting by applying enacted statutory tax rates applicable to future years to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of existing assets and liabilities 
sfas also requires that deferred tax assets be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in connection with the preparation of our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income tax liability for each of the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current income tax expense and assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of certain income or expense items for income tax reporting and financial reporting purposes 
we also recognize as deferred tax assets the expected future tax benefits of net operating loss carry forwards 
in evaluating the realizability of deferred tax assets associated with net operating loss carry forwards  we consider  among other things  expected future taxable income  the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary reporting differences  and the expected impact of tax planning strategies that may be implemented to prevent the potential loss of future tax benefits 
changes in  among other things  income tax legislation  statutory income tax rates or future taxable income levels could materially impact the our valuation of income tax assets and liabilities and could cause our income tax provision to vary significantly among financial reporting periods 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between this statement and issue relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
adoption of this statement is required for exit or disposal activity initiated after december  any exit or disposal activity which has been completed or has already been committed to as of december  is accounted for under eitf currently  inforte does not have any new exit or disposal activity that will occur after december   beyond the exit of a portion of our office space at our chicago location  which will continue to be accounted under issue thus we do not believe that the adoption of this statement at present has an effect on inforte s results of operations or financial position 
in july  the financial accounting standards board s emerging issues task force issued abstract  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
this abstract addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
under this abstract  companies which have multiple revenue generating activities are required to segment their activities into separate units of accounting for revenue recognition purposes 
for example  a company that engages a client to integrate an enterprise wide software application and manage the ongoing maintenance of that application in a production environment  would have to separate the project into phases and recognize revenue for those phases under the fasb and sec pronouncement that is appropriate for each phase 
this abstract has not been finalized by the eitf  and any further changes may affect inforte s reporting of revenue 
however  under the current abstract  we believe that inforte s revenue generating activities are all similar in nature  and thus would not require separate accounting treatment 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we do not intend to adopt the fair value method  thus the sections of this statement which address transition to the fair value method  will not affect the presentation of our consolidated financial statements 
however  we report pro forma disclosures in accordance with sfas  in the notes to the annual financial statements  and thus  these pro forma disclosures will now be provided on a quarterly basis 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency risk during  our international revenues were over of our total net revenue 
we face additional risks internationally that we do not face domestically 
such risks include longer customer payment cycles  adverse taxes and compliance with local laws and regulations 
further  the effects of fluctuations in currency exchange rates may adversely affect the results of operations 
finally  as the us economic slowdown has spread to the rest of the world  our ability to obtain international revenue going forward could be limited 
interest rate risk as of december  inforte s total short term and long term marketable securities equaled million 
during  interest income represented of inforte s pre tax income 
as a result  fluctuations in interest rates can have a significant impact on our net income loss per share 
we estimate that the impact on interest income from a percentage point change in interest rates could change our annual net income loss per share by approximately per diluted share 
our estimate is calculated using december  investment balances and fourth quarter diluted weighted average shares outstanding
