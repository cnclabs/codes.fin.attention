item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial information and the consolidated financial statements and notes appearing elsewhere in this form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements  such as statements of expected revenues and expenses that involve risks and uncertainties 
we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those detailed from time to time in our filings with the securities and exchange commission and those discussed in this form k  particularly in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and under factors that may affect future results 
unless expressly stated or the content otherwise requires  the terms we  our  us  the company and gric refer to gric communications  inc and its subsidiaries as a whole 
overview we provide remote internet access  managed security services both virtual private network and remote end point security and mobile broadband services for customers requiring mobile office communications capabilities worldwide 
our services solution  called the gric mobileoffice  enables people who are working away from the office to remain productively and securely connected to their home network as if they were working in their office 
our solution is used by corporate enterprises with mobile employees and remote workforces on a global basis 
we provide services over a heterogeneous virtual network known as the gric tierone network 
as of february   the gric tierone network included more than  internet access dialing locations  public wireless fidelity or wifi hotspots and over public broadband access points in approximately countries 
we created this network by forming contractual relationships with over internet service providers and telecommunication companies 
these providers  whom we refer to as the gric tierone network members  are able to share their communications networks 
our customers benefit from the resulting network delivering a secure mobile internet access solution cost effectively 
our member providers benefit from the gric tierone network because we manage this shared network and provide settlement services as a clearinghouse 
as a clearinghouse  we have established common technical  service and payment standards to settle charges that our customers incur when their end users access the network facilities of gric tierone network members in order to initiate internet based communications  such as internet roaming 
we intend to continue evolving our service offering to introduce new internet based mobile office communications services that may be adopted  deployed and managed on a global scale across the gric tierone network 
from our incorporation in until we were both an internet service provider in northern california and an independent software developer for the internet service provider community 
in  we sold our local internet service provider business 
since that time most of our revenue has come from providing settlement and clearinghouse services for our customers 
from late until january  we primarily provided internet telephony services that were characterized by high revenues that generated low margins 
in january we ceased providing those services to focus on providing internet based mobile office communications services based on our clearinghouse and settlement capabilities to service providers and corporate enterprises globally 
we have incurred substantial losses since our inception as a result of expenses associated with building the gric tierone network and related network infrastructure and developing our software products 
although we were cash flow positive for the first time during the fourth quarter of  we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  we cannot assure you that we will sustain profitability 
see factors that may affect future results we have a history of net losses and may incur future losses 
our business model has evolved in the course of our development and we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results should not be relied upon as indicative of future performance 
our future prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in the early stages of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
see factors that may affect future results we have limited experience in our business  which makes it more difficult for us to execute our business plan and for you to evaluate us 
critical accounting policies and estimates the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our consolidated financial statements 
we evaluate our estimates and judgments on an on going basis 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances when made 
our experience and assumptions form the basis for our judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities and reported amounts of revenues and expenses that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may vary from what we anticipate  and different assumptions or estimates about the future could change our reported results 
we believe the following accounting policies are the most critical to us  because they are important to the portrayal of our financial statements and they require our most difficult  subjective or complex judgments in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and related allowances 
we derive revenues primarily from remote internet access services we provide to customers through our virtual network 
these services are generally billed on a per minute basis for usage or at a flat rate per month per user based on negotiated rates 
we have some customers with minimum commitment arrangements 
to a lesser extent  we also derive a portion of our revenues from licenses of our authentication software  related maintenance and support services  which are recognized ratably over the contractual services period or term of service  and other optional services related to our gric mobileoffice offering 
these other revenues amounted to five percent or less of total revenues over the last three years 
revenues are recognized when a binding agreement or purchase order from the customer has been received  the services have been delivered  the fee or price was fixed or determinable  the collection of the receivable was reasonably assured  and no significant post delivery obligations remained 
from late to early revenues were also derived from internet telephony services 
we record estimated allowances against revenues in the same period the revenues are recorded 
these estimates are based upon historical analysis of our credit memo data and other known factors for pricing and transaction volume disputes that arise in the normal course of business 
to date  allowances pertaining to our current business have not been significant 
if the historical data we use to calculate these estimates does not accurately reflect amounts associated with future disputes  our actual revenues could be higher or lower than what we have recognized 
from time to time our customers  including significant customers  may seek protection under bankruptcy laws 
when this occurs  our management determines our risk that an account receivable will prove to be uncollectible  and establishes appropriate reserves for that contingency as necessary 
in addition  for each continuing customer in bankruptcy management evaluates the creditworthiness of the customer and determines whether revenue should be recognized on an accrual basis or as cash payments are received 
when we record revenue on an accrual basis  management has based their judgment on the creditworthiness of the debtor in possession  their experience  and reasonable assurance of collectibility of receivables  in addition to other revenue recognition criteria having been met 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from our customers inability to make payments they owe us 
in order to estimate the appropriate level of this allowance  we analyze historical bad debts  customer concentrations  current customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate and to impair their ability to make payments to us  additional allowances might be required in future periods 
if our estimates prove too low  future revenues will be lower 
impairment of long lived assets 
we evaluate the carrying amount of our long lived assets  annually or when events or changes in business circumstances have occurred  that indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be fully realizable 
determination of impairment is based on an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows that result from the use of the assets and their eventual disposition 
if we determine that these assets have been impaired  the impairment charge will be recorded based on a comparison of the net book value of the assets and the fair value 
asset fair value is determined based on either discounted future cash flows that result from the use of the assets over their average remaining useful lives or specific appraisal 
restructuring expenses and related accruals 
in each of january and june  we undertook plans to restructure our operations in order to reduce operating expenses 
estimated restructuring expenses have included severance and outplacement costs  lease cancellations  asset write offs and other restructuring costs 
given the significance of  and timing of the execution of such activities  this process is complex and involves periodic reassessments of estimates made at the time the original decisions were made 
our restructuring expenses involved significant estimates made by management using the best information available at the time that the estimates were made  some of which were based upon information provided by third parties 
we continually evaluate the adequacy of the remaining liabilities under our restructuring initiatives 
although we believe that these estimates accurately reflect the costs of our restructuring plans  actual results may differ  thereby requiring us to record additional provisions or reverse a portion of such provisions 
results of operations compared to revenues revenues consist of amounts owed by our customers from utilizing our remote internet access services or other services from our gric mobileoffice offering that we provided 
total revenues increased to million in from million in  representing an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to increased volumes of our remote internet access services by our existing customers and to a lesser degree the expansion of our customer base 
revenues include those from worldcom uunet  a customer who accounted for more than of our total consolidated revenues for the year ended and who filed a voluntary petition for relief under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
worldcom uunet continues to generate business for us and we continue to recognize revenues from this customer on an accrual basis based on our revenue recognition criteria 
to date all amounts owed by worldcom uunet to us for services rendered subsequent to its chapter filing have been paid in accordance with the terms of our agreement with worldcom uunet 
internet telephony revenues of  were recorded during and no internet telephony settlement revenues were recorded during we expect revenues to exceed based on increased usage of our remote internet access services as well as increased sales of our managed security service offering and our value added services 
costs and expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of amounts we pay to access the internet in order to provide remote internet access services for our customers and to offer other mobile broadband services and  in earlier periods  include amounts we paid to terminate internet telephony services for our customers 
cost of revenues increased to million in from million in  which represented an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to the corresponding increases in the volume of remote internet access and the expansion of our customer base 
internet telephony costs of million were recorded during and no internet telephony settlement costs were recorded during we expect that for the cost of revenues will increase in absolute dollars as remote internet access revenues increase  but will decline as a percentage of total revenues 
network and operations 
network and operations expenses include salaries and benefits  depreciation on network equipment  allocated facility and management information systems expenses  administrative expenses  costs of co location of network equipment and leased telecommunication lines and other related costs 
network and operations expenses decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of 
the decrease of approximately million was primarily due to reductions of approximately million in compensation related expenses that were primarily due to lower staffing levels  the elimination of compensation programs and a reduction of approximately  in depreciation expense primarily associated with older assets that are still in use  but have reached the end of their estimated lives for accounting purposes 
we expect the amount of network and operations expenses to increase in as we increase our customer support department to accommodate our shift to supporting enterprise customers and purchase new servers to replace those that have reached the end of their useful lives 
research and development 
research and development expenses consist of quality assurance  salaries and benefits  allocated facility and management information systems  depreciation costs  outside consultants  facilities costs  administration and other related costs 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of 
the decrease of approximately million includes reductions of approximately million in compensation related expenses  approximately  in outside professional services expenses and  in allocated expenses  primarily due to shifting our staffing from our us headquarters to our development center in india where engineering talent is available at more favorable rates 
we expect research and development expenses to increase moderately in sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries and benefits  allocated facility and management information systems costs  travel and entertainment costs  costs for marketing and promotional programs  outside consultants  commissions earned by sales and marketing personnel  and costs associated with domestic and international sales offices and other related costs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of 
the decrease of approximately million reflects reductions of approximately million in compensation related expenses  approximately  in marketing and promotional programs and approximately  in expenses pertaining to the recruitment and development of employees  each of which were principally the result of decreased staffing levels following our january restructuring and continued efforts to streamline our operations in we expect the overall amount of sales and marketing expenses to significantly increase during as we shift our business strategy from an indirect sales channel to both an indirect and direct sales channel 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist of general corporate and facility costs as well as salary  benefits and related costs for executive  finance  legal  administrative  human resources  investor relations and management information systems functions and provisions for uncollectible receivables 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in  representing an decrease of 
the decrease of approximately million was primarily due to reductions of approximately million in compensation related expenses  the write off of approximately million of uncollected internet telephony receivables in and approximately  in outside professional services  all related to streamlining our operations 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase  of approximately  in allocated facility and management information systems 
we expect the amount of general and administrative expenses to gradually increase in in order to support the business strategy set forth for amortization of stock based compensation 
some stock options previously granted through december  were considered compensatory because the deemed fair value for accounting purposes was higher than the stock option exercise price as determined by the board of directors on the date of grant 
as a result  we recorded amortization of deferred compensation expense of  in and  in included in amortization of stock based compensation is  and  for network and operations   and  for research and development   and  for sales and marketing and  and  for general and administrative in and  respectively 
as of december   we had an aggregate of  of deferred compensation remaining to be amortized 
deferred compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options 
we expect amortization to end in restructuring charge 
in each of june and january  we undertook plans to restructure operations in order to reduce operating expenses 
in our june strategic restructuring  we streamlined our operations in order to help us achieve profitability 
this restructuring consisted of a charge to operations of million  of which  related to involuntary employee severance costs   related to the termination of lease and other obligations and  related to the retirement of fixed assets due to a facility closure 
during  the restructuring accrual was reduced by cash payments of  we recorded a reversal to our restructuring accrual in the amount of  during as a result of final settlements that were less than the amount of previously reserved obligations 
as of december   the remaining balance in our restructuring accrual was  in our january strategic restructuring  we decided to cease providing internet telephony settlement services  based on an analysis of the operating expenses required to support these services and the low gross margins associated with them  and on our expectation that continued internet telephony operations would require additional cash infusions to the business 
this restructuring consisted of a charge to operations of million  of which  related to involuntary employee severance costs  million related to the termination of lease and facility obligations and million related to the retirement of fixed assets pertaining to the portion of the business that was discontinued 
as of december   the remaining accruals from our january restructuring amounted to  during  the accrual was offset by cash payments of  and we recorded reversals to our restructuring accrual in the amount of  during the year ended december   we sold internet telephony assets that were previously written off during the restructuring in january for a gain of approximately  these accruals were reversed as a result of final settlements that were less than the amount of previously reserved obligations 
the remaining balance in our restructuring accrual was  interest income and other  net interest income and other  net  primarily represents interest income on cash balances and on short term investments 
interest income and other  net  decreased to  in from  in  representing a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to the higher cash balances in resulting from our initial public offering in december and subsequent reductions of cash used in operations 
interest expense interest expense consists of interest expense associated with capital leases and amortization of the fair value of warrants issued in connection with our financing activities 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in  primarily due to the payment of outstanding capital lease obligations 
the warrants were fully amortized in income taxes the provision for income taxes decreased to  in from  in the provision for income taxes consists of foreign taxes 
sfas statement no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of these assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and reported cumulative net losses in all prior years  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
we intend to evaluate the ability to realize the deferred tax assets on a quarterly basis 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal purposes of approximately million  which expire in years through we also had net operating loss carryforwards for state purposes of approximately million  which expire in years through we have federal and state research and development tax credits  respectively  of approximately  which expire in years through and approximately  which carry forward indefinitely 
utilization of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the ownership change limitations provided by the internal revenue code and similar state provisions 
such an ownership change could occur as a result of future financing activities as well as secondary trading in our securities 
the annual limitation might result in the expiration of the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards before utilization 
results of operations compared to revenues total revenues decreased to million in from million in  representing a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily attributed to a decrease of million in internet telephony services and  of licenses of certain components of our software related maintenance and services  partially offset by a million increase in our remote internet access services due to the expansion of our customer base and increased volumes by our existing customers 
costs and expenses cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists of amounts we pay to access the internet in order to provide remote internet access services for our customers and amounts we paid to terminate internet telephony services for our customers through january before we ceased providing those services 
cost of revenues decreased to million in from million in  which represented a decrease of 
the decrease primarily represents an million decrease in internet telephony costs partially offset by a million increase in remote internet access costs due to increased volumes of internet access services 
internet access costs decreased as a percentage of revenues in primarily due to lower rates obtained from our providers 
network and operations 
network and operations expenses decreased to million in from million in  which represented a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to elimination of co location and telecommunication costs as we ceased to provide internet telephony services 
this decrease was partially offset by an overall increase in staffing and related expenses to provide customer support and to operate our network centers on a hours a day  seven days a week basis 
research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in  which represented a decrease of 
the decrease was primarily due to engineering personnel reductions following our january restructuring as we focused principally on continued development of our core internet roaming software 
we also reduced costs by expanding the use of our development center in india  where engineering talent may be obtained at more favorable rates than in the san francisco bay area 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million in from million in  which represented an increase of 
the increase reflected our investment in marketing campaigns and professional services to promote our corporate image and brand identity 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in  which represented an increase of 
the increase was primarily due to the write off of all uncollected internet telephony receivables in amortization of stock based compensation 
amortization of deferred compensation expense of  in and included in amortization of stock based compensation is  and  for network and operations   and  for research and development   and  for sales and marketing and  and  for general and administrative in and  respectively 
as of december   we had an aggregate of  of deferred compensation remaining to be amortized 
deferred compensation is amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options 
restructuring charge 
in our january strategic restructuring  we decided to cease providing internet telephony settlement services  based on an analysis of the operating expenses required to support these services and the low gross margins associated with them  and on our expectation that continued internet telephony operations would require additional cash infusions to the business 
this restructuring consisted of a charge to operations of million  of which  related to involuntary employee severance costs  million related to the termination of lease and facility obligations and million related to the retirement of fixed assets pertaining to the portion of the business that was discontinued

sfas statement no 
provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if realization of these assets is more likely than not 
based upon the weight of available evidence  which includes our historical operating performance and reported cumulative net losses in all prior years  we have provided a full valuation allowance against our net deferred tax assets 
liquidity and capital resources in thousands cash and cash equivalents    net cash used in operating activities    net cash used in provided by investing activities   net cash used in provided by financing activities  cash and cash equivalents 
our principal source of liquidity is our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments 
as of december   in addition to our cash and cash equivalents balance of million  we had a short term investment balance of approximately million 
we achieved cash flow positive results for our combined activities in the fourth quarter of operating activities net cash used in operating activities in of million was primarily a result of our net operating losses of million  lower accruals for compensation and benefits of million principally due to the elimination of our bonus plan and higher accounts receivable balances of  from increased revenues 
the net cash used in operating activities was partially offset by adjustments from depreciation and amortization of property and equipment of million 
net cash used in operating activities in of million was primarily a result of our net operating losses of million  lower accounts payable balances of million and lower deferred revenue of  both of which were a result of our january restructuring event 
the net cash used in operating activities was partially offset by adjustments from the noncash portion of the restructuring charge of million  depreciation and amortization of property and equipment of million and higher accounts receivable allowances of million  all of which were a result of our january restructuring event 
net cash used in operating activities in of million was primarily a result of our net operating losses of million and higher accounts receivable balances of million due to increased revenues 
the net cash used in operating activities was partially offset by adjustments from depreciation and amortization of property and equipment of million  higher accounts payable balances of million and higher accounts receivable allowances of million  all are due to increased operating costs associated with increased revenues 
investing activities 
net cash used in investing activities in of million was primarily the result of investing in short term instruments using the funds received in april from our series a preferred stock funding 
net cash provided by investing activities in of million was primarily the result of proceeds from maturing short term investments to fund net operating activities 
net cash used in investing activities in of million was primarily the result of investing in short term instruments using the funds received from the company s initial public offering 
financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities in of million was primarily the result of receiving proceeds from the issuance of our series a preferred stock 
net cash used in financing activities in of  was primarily the result of debt payments and the purchase of common stock 
net cash provided by financing activities in of million was primarily the result of proceeds from sales of common stock through incentive stock options and the employee stock purchase plan 
commitments 
we have entered into certain operating leases and purchase commitments 
the future minimum operating lease and purchase noncancelable commitments were as follows at december  operating leases purchase commitments thereafter we lease all of our facilities under operating leases that expire at various dates through we have entered into certain purchase commitments from suppliers who provide network access  software and related services that are utilized by us in order to deliver our gric mobileoffice solution 
stock repurchase program 
in september  the board of directors approved a program to expend up to million to repurchase shares of our common stock in open market transactions 
we purchased  shares for approximately  during no additional shares were repurchased by us in summary of liquidity 
we were cash flow positive for our combined activities in the fourth quarter of we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million at december  and cash expected to be generated by operations during the next twelve months  will fund planned operations for at least the next twelve months 
we expect to be cash flow negative for our combined activities in the first quarter of due to the projected operating results as well as the timing of invoices that normally are due at the beginning of each year 
on april   we sold  shares of our series a redeemable convertible preferred stock  for million  to investors affiliated with h q asia pacific and vertex management 
the net proceeds of the offering  after deducting expenses  were million 
at the closing of the transaction  we also issued to these investors warrants to purchase  shares of series a preferred stock at a purchase price of per share  and warrants to purchase  shares of series a preferred stock at a purchase price of per share 
the warrants are exercisable at any time within five years after the closing 
each share of series a preferred stock is initially convertible into the company s common stock at any time at the option of the holders on a for basis 
furthermore  the series a preferred stock will convert automatically into common stock upon the earlier of the fifth anniversary of the date of issuance or the th consecutive trading day that the closing price of the company s common stock is at least per share 
we plan to invest in expanding our internet roaming and related services  on a global basis  by continuing to build strategic partnering relationships 
this will require us to maintain market acceptance  and to grow our internet roaming and related services offerings in order for us to continue our research and development activities and fund planned operating expenses 
there can be no assurance that our internet roaming product offerings will maintain market acceptance  growth and operating margins 
if we are unable to attain our revenue and margin goals  significant reductions in spending and the delay or cancellation of planned activities or more substantial restructuring may be necessary to enable us to meet our cash requirements through the next months 
these actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and prospects 
furthermore  we may need to raise additional funds in future periods through public or private financing  or other arrangements  to fund operations and potential acquisitions  if any 
although we achieved cash flow positive results for our combined activities during the fourth quarter  we may not remain cash flow positive 
if additional financing is needed  it might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
failure to raise capital when needed could seriously harm our business and results of operations 
if additional funds were raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage of ownership of our stockholders would be reduced 
furthermore  these equity securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to our common stock 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
the principle difference between sfas and eitf relates to its requirement for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
this statement requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost as defined in eitf was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
this statement also establishes that fair value is the objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a roll forward of the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of fin we do not expect the adoption of the accounting requirements of fin will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim financial statement disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the transition provisions do not currently have an impact on our consolidated financial position and results of operations as we have not elected to adopt the fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation as per sfas we have adopted the annual disclosure requirements of sfas factors that may affect future results in addition to the other information in this annual report on form k  the following should be considered in evaluating gric and our business 
we have a history of net losses and may incur future losses 
we have incurred net losses every year since our inception 
we reported operating losses before income taxes of approximately million in  million for  and million for although we were profitable in the fourth quarter of  as of december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
although we experienced positive cash flow in the fourth quarter of  we have experienced negative cash flows in each year since our inception in we cannot assure you that we will remain profitable or cash flow positive 
we expect to be cash flow negative in the first quarter of moreover  we might not be able to increase our operating profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
to increase profits  we will need to generate additional revenue growth from our existing customers and to obtain new customers  while continuing to control our expenses 
we expect to continue to invest in network and operations  research and development and sales and marketing  and we expect to face pressure to adopt new pricing arrangements  including volume discounts  that may lower our gross margins 
if revenues do not meet levels we anticipate  or if our costs and expenses exceed our expectations  our quarterly losses would likely resume  and the price of our common stock is likely to decline as a result 
our operating history is more limited than that of many companies  so you may find it difficult to evaluate our business in making any investment decision 
we have limited experience in our business  which makes it more difficult for us to execute our business plan and for you to evaluate us 
we have limited experience providing clearinghouse services having done so since only and it is only since january that our efforts have been focused primarily on providing services that enable our customers to provide internet roaming services to their end users 
many members of our senior management team and other employees have worked with us for only a short period of time 
as a result of our limited operating history  we have little meaningful historical financial data upon which to plan operating expenses or forecast our revenues accurately 
this combination of factors makes it difficult for us to plan and to implement plans  and it makes it difficult for you to evaluate your investment in gric 
we may require additional capital for our operations  which could have a negative effect on your investment 
if our cash together with the funds we raised in april through the sale of our series a preferred stock prove to be insufficient to fund our operations  we may need to raise additional funds at some point in the future 
if we raise additional funds by selling equity or convertible debt securities  our stockholders may experience additional dilution and these new securities may have powers  preferences and rights that are senior to those of the rights of our common stock 
for example  as a result of the april sale of our series a preferred stock  the investors control a significant portion of our outstanding capital stock  and the owners of the series a preferred stock have claims that are senior to those of holders of the common stock in the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation  and the issuance of the series a preferred stock has substantially diluted the ownership interest of the common stockholders 
we cannot predict whether additional financing will be available on terms favorable to us  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to fund our business operations  promote our brand identity  take advantage of acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or respond to competitive pressures 
any inability to do so could have a negative effect on our business  revenues  financial condition and results of operations 
we restructured our business in to focus on our internet roaming service  which makes us more dependent on the success of this service 
in january  we ceased providing internet telephony service and focused on providing our internet roaming service 
this concentration makes us more dependent on the growth of the internet roaming market  and more vulnerable if our internet roaming product offerings are not favorably received in the market or if we fail to achieve our revenue and margin targets 
we face significant competition  including competition from larger companies  which could make it more difficult for us to succeed 
our business environment is intensely competitive  highly fragmented and rapidly changing 
competition can come from many sources 
for example  we compete directly with ipass in the market for internet roaming and related settlement services  and ipass has a network that competes with the gric tierone network 
large communications service providers such as at t  equant and worldcom uunet also have the ability and resources to compete with us in the internet based mobile office communications services market 
we could also face competition from emerging  wireless based network service providers targeting the traveling business communities 
many of our competitors have substantially greater resources  larger customer bases  longer operating histories  greater name recognition and more established relationships in the industry than we have 
any of these competitors may combine or form strategic partnerships  gaining competitive advantages as a result 
our competitors may be able to develop and market products and services that are superior to our own in terms of features  quality  pricing or other factors 
this competition may result in reduced prices and longer sales cycles for our products 
if any of our larger competitors were to commit greater technical  sales  marketing and other resources to our markets  it would be more difficult to compete 
since we have no assurance that our customers will continue to use our services or that our customer base will expand  we have little ability to predict revenue growth or operating results 
our customers are generally free to use competing products and services  so we could face significant customer losses  at unpredictable times 
our customers are generally not obligated to generate minimum revenues  and some generate very little revenue for us 
we are dependent upon a small number of companies for a major portion of our revenue 
in four customers accounted for more than ten percent of our revenues sony communication network corporation  fiberlink communications corporation  worldcom uunet and america online  inc 
worldcom uunet is currently in bankruptcy 
losing any of these customers would mean a significant revenue shortfall for us 
these factors make it difficult to anticipate the level of our future revenues from existing customers 
in addition  our success depends on our ability to expand our customer base 
if we are unable to expand our customer base and to increase our average revenues per customer  our business success will be less likely 
if we fail in our strategy of focusing our sales efforts on larger companies  our revenue and profitability goals will likely not be achieved 
historically  a significant portion of our revenues was derived from smaller companies in the internet marketplace  but in recent periods we have attempted to focus our sales and marketing efforts on larger corporate and enterprise level customers 
this strategy places new demands on our business  such as the longer sales cycles and higher levels of service and support that larger accounts generally require 
if we fail in this strategy  or if we have underestimated the costs of this strategy  we will likely miss our revenue and profitability goals 
if new services  products or features we introduce do not succeed in the marketplace  we will not be able to generate new revenues and will have increased costs without the expected returns 
the success of our business depends on our ability to introduce new services  products and features that will generate new revenues 
each effort to develop and introduce a new service  product or feature involves investments of money  personnel and time  as well as opportunity costs 
in we introduced gric mobileoffice  a product suite that includes wireless access  security monitoring and other features in addition to our traditional dial up access 
we have no assurance that this new product will be accepted by the marketplace  or whether competing technologies will be more popular 
further  we do not know whether third party developers of internet communications applications will be willing to develop new applications that can be delivered as part of our mobile office communications solutions  or that we will be able to develop any applications of this type ourselves 
if our new products are not successful  we will not achieve a profitable return on the costs of product development and launch  and we will have lost opportunities to pursue other products 
we depend on our customers to market internet based communications services to their end users  so if our customers fail to market their services effectively  our revenues may be reduced 
our business depends on the efforts and success of our customers in marketing internet based communications services to their end users 
we have little ability to promote our services  or to promote demand for our customers services generally 
the use of the internet as a medium for communications services remains unproven 
if our customers fail to market their internet based communications services effectively  our revenues will be reduced 
similarly  if the market for internet based communications services fails to grow  or expands more slowly than anticipated  our revenues will be lower than expected 
the internet based services we provide are relatively new and have not achieved widespread market acceptance 
network service providers and communication solutions providers may be reluctant to promote or rely upon our services until they gain greater commercial acceptance  which may never occur 
sales in the internet infrastructure market are unpredictable  and since we depend on sales to this market our revenues and any earnings are at risk when the market declines 
sales to the internet infrastructure market are characterized by sporadic purchasing decisions and sensitivity to expansions and contractions in the telecommunications industry 
recently  many companies have warned of purchasing declines in the internet infrastructure market 
sales activity in this industry depends upon the stage of completion of expanding network infrastructures  the availability of funding  and the extent to which service providers are affected by local regulatory and business conditions 
if our sales do not match our expectations we would likely be unable to remain profitable 
the unpredictability of our quarterly results may cause the trading price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly revenues and operating results have varied in the past and are likely to fluctuate unpredictably in the future for many reasons beyond our control 
any of these factors could cause our stock price to decline 
the primary factors that affect revenues and operating results  in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this section  include the following the volume of transaction based revenues  the timing of deployment of services by our customers  competitive pricing pressure  changes in global travel patterns due to past and potential future terrorist activities in the us and the military responses to them in the middle east  southern asia and elsewhere  the mix of services used by our customers end users  difficulty collecting accounts receivable  particularly from customers based outside the us  and regulation  domestically and internationally 
our operating expenses are largely determined based on our expectations about revenues 
a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a result  lower than anticipated revenues for any reason could cause substantial operating losses 
our customers require a high degree of reliability in the delivery of our services  and if we cannot meet their expectations for any reason  demand for our products and services will suffer 
our success depends on our ability to assure generally error free clearinghouse services  uninterrupted operation of our network and software infrastructure  and a satisfactory experience for our customers end users 
in the past  we have experienced problems due to our inability to detect system malfunctions and due to errors in collecting or processing account usage and settlement data 
due to the high level of performance required for critical communications traffic  any failure to deliver a satisfactory experience to end users  whether or not caused by our own failures  and any failure to provide accurate settlement data in connection with acting as a clearinghouse  could reduce demand for our products and services 
as a clearinghouse  we have greater collection risks than many other companies  which makes it more difficult to predict our revenues and may increase our operating costs 
difficulties in collecting accounts receivable will harm our financial results  and this collection risk is inherently greater for us as a clearinghouse service provider because we are obligated to pay amounts owed to each customer whether or not we have collected all the amounts due to us from other customers 
in addition  if end users or unauthorized third parties engage in unauthorized or otherwise fraudulent roaming activity  we may face difficulty collecting the resulting accounts receivable 
if we are not able to manage this problem  our financial results will suffer 
our long sales cycle makes it particularly difficult for us to forecast revenues  requires us to incur high sales costs  and aggravates fluctuations in quarterly financial results 
our business is characterized by a long sales cycle the time between initial contact with a potential customer and the resulting purchase and deployment of our service 
typically  our sales cycle is between three to twelve months  and the actual length of a sales cycle depends on a number of factors such as the complexity of the customer s business and needs  the nature of services being purchased and the level of deployment 
even after a sale is made there may be further delays before new users are brought into our system and we begin to realize associated revenues 
as a result  we typically incur substantial sales costs before we recognize any related revenues 
it is possible that in some periods there will be unusually high costs associated with the long sales cycle  or that the length of the sales cycle will increase  which could have a material effect on our business 
because much of our business is conducted internationally  we encounter special difficulties  which may impede our efforts to remain profitable and harm the trading price of our common stock 
we generate most of our revenues from business conducted internationally  so we are subject to special risks 
it is costly to maintain international facilities and operations  promote our brand internationally and develop localized systems and support centers 
in some regions revenues may not offset the expense of maintaining operations there 
some of the risks that we face as a result of our international operations include foreign customers often take longer to pay for services  business activity is often slow in some region or another  negatively impacting overall results  foreign currency exchange rates fluctuate and can impact our results  recruitment and retention of experienced senior management and staff for our international operations is costly  compliance with a variety of foreign laws  tariffs and trade barriers is costly and inefficient for a small company such as ours  compliance with telecommunications and other internet related regulations in foreign jurisdictions is expensive and difficult  and general geopolitical risks  such as political and economic instability and changes in diplomatic and trade relationships  can have a significant impact on our business 
terrorist acts and acts of war may seriously harm our business and revenue  costs and expenses and financial condition 
terrorist acts or acts of war  including current military actions in iraq and other parts of the middle east  may cause damage or disruption to us  our employees  facilities  partners  suppliers  resellers or customers  which could significantly impact our revenue  costs and expenses and financial condition 
the terrorist attacks that took place in the united states on september  were unprecedented events that have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may materially harm our business and results of operations 
the long term effects on our business of the september  attacks and the current state of warfare in the middle east are unknown 
the potential for future terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks or perceived threats to national security  and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic and political uncertainties that could adversely affect our business and results of operations in ways that cannot presently be predicted 
in addition  as a multi national company with headquarters and significant operations located in the united states  we may be impacted by actions against the united states 
we are predominantly uninsured for losses and interruptions caused by terrorist acts and acts of war 
the economic downturn could adversely affect our revenue  gross margins and expenses 
our revenue and gross margins depend in part on the overall demand for information technology products and services  particularly in the product and service segments in which we compete 
softening demand for our products and services caused by the ongoing economic downturn has resulted in decreased revenue growth rates  and may in the future result in decreased revenue  earnings or growth rates and problems with our ability to realize customer receivables 
the global economy has weakened and market conditions continue to be challenging 
as a result  companies are delaying or reducing expenditures  including those for information technology 
in addition  if our customers experience financial difficulties  we could suffer losses associated with the outstanding portion of accounts receivable 
the global economic downturn has contributed to reported declines in our revenue growth during fiscal further delays or reductions in information technology spending could have a material adverse effect on demand for our products and services and consequently our results of operations  prospects and stock price 
we need to hire and retain qualified personnel to sustain the growth of our business  which is particularly difficult for us because we compete with other companies in the san francisco bay area where we are based 
our future success depends  in part  on the continued service of our key executive  management and technical personnel  and our ability to attract new skilled employees 
from time to time we have experienced difficulty in hiring and retaining highly skilled employees  and we expect to continue to experience this sort of difficulty 
declines in the market price of our common stock could also hurt employee morale and retention 
if we are not able to retain our key employees or to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees in the future  our business could be harmed because our growth might be slowed or executive leadership might be disrupted 
it is difficult to hire and retain qualified sales personnel 
highly trained sales personnel are key to our performance 
competition for these individuals is often intense  and we may not be able to hire the type and number of sales personnel we need 
moreover  even after we hire salespersons  they require extensive training in our products and services 
this training typically covers six to eight weeks of formal in class and on the job instruction 
if we are unable to continue to retain our current employees and train new sales personnel as rapidly as necessary  we may not be able to increase market awareness and sales of our services  which may prevent us from generating revenue and maintaining profitability 
we could become subject to litigation regarding intellectual property rights that could be costly and result in the loss of significant rights 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
we may become a party to a litigation in the future to protect our intellectual property or as a result of an alleged infringement of another party s intellectual property 
claims for alleged infringement and any resulting lawsuit  if successful  could subject us to significant liability for damages and invalidation of our proprietary rights 
these lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention 
any potential intellectual property litigation could also force us to do one or more of the following stop or delay selling  incorporating or using products that use the challenged intellectual property  obtain from the owner of the infringed intellectual property right a license to sell or use the relevant technology  which license might not be available on reasonable terms or at all  and redesign the products that use that technology 
if we are forced to take any of these actions  our business might be seriously harmed 
our insurance may not cover potential claims of this type or may not be adequate to indemnify us for all liability that could be imposed 
the concentration of our capital stock ownership with insiders will likely limit the ability of other stockholders to influence corporate matters 
as of february   our executive officers and directors  and their related entities  owned approximately of our outstanding common stock and common stock equivalents 
as a result  these stockholders will be able to exercise control over all matters requiring approval of our stockholders  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
this concentration of ownership might also have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of the company that might be viewed as beneficial by other stockholders 
the interests of some of these stockholders may not be aligned with the interest of the common stockholders 
the holders of our series a preferred stock have special rights  preferences and privileges  including liquidation preferences that are senior to those of the holders of our common stock in the event of a bankruptcy or liquidation 
as the holders of our series a preferred stock reduce their ownership interest through resales pursuant to our prospectus dated september   or otherwise  their interest in contributing to our success may decline and the price of our common stock may be harmed 
some of the holders of our series a preferred stock identified in our prospectus dated september  have a substantial investment in gric and to the extent that they liquidate their investment through sales of such stock  they will have a diminished interest in contributing to our success 
in addition  the registration and sale of the shares held by the selling stockholders may result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
provisions in our charter documents might deter a company from acquiring us  which could inhibit your ability to receive an acquisition premium for your shares 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation  bylaws and delaware law make it difficult for a third party to acquire us  despite the possible benefit to our stockholders  and this may potentially lower the price of our common stock 
these provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws authorize the board to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval  prohibit cumulative voting in the election of directors  limit the persons who may call special meetings of stockholders  and establish advance notice requirements for nominations for the election of the board of directors or for proposing matters that can be acted on by stockholders at stockholder meetings 
in addition  we have elected to remain subject to the anti takeover provisions of delaware law 
these factors may discourage takeover attempts 
if our common stock price falls below and remains under  or if we otherwise fail to comply with nasdaq rules  our common stock could be delisted from the nasdaq national market  which could severely limit the trading market for our common stock 
if we fail to meet the criteria for continued listing on the nasdaq national market  our common stock may be delisted  which could make it more difficult for you to sell your shares 
for example  if the market price for our common stock falls and remains below per share for thirty trading days  we would be subject to delisting 
on february   the closing price of our common stock was 
security concerns may deter the use of the internet for internet based communications  which would reduce demand for our products and services 
the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks is a significant barrier to widespread adoption of electronic commerce and communications 
the internet is a public network and information is sent over this network from many sources 
advances in computer capabilities  new discoveries in the field of code breaking or other developments could result in compromised security on our network or the networks of others 
security and authentication concerns with respect to the transmission over the internet of confidential information  such as corporate access passwords  and the ability of unauthorized computer users  so called hackers  to penetrate online security systems may reduce the demand for our services 
if any well publicized compromises of confidential information were to occur  it could reduce demand for internet based communications and our products and services 
government regulations and legal uncertainties regarding the internet could harm our business 
at present  internet based communication services are not subject to fees that the us federal communications commission generally imposes on entities that use the local telephone network to access customers 
internet based communication services also are generally not subject to other federal fees or taxes imposed to support programs such as universal telephone service 
changes in the rules or regulations of the us federal communications commission or in applicable federal communications laws to impose such fees or taxes could add significant new costs to our operations  and we are not certain how those increased costs could affect demand for our services 
any new law or regulation pertaining to internet based communication services  or the application or interpretation of existing laws  could decrease the demand for our services  increase our cost of doing business or otherwise harm our business 
there is  and will likely continue to be  an increasing number of laws and regulations pertaining to the internet 
these laws or regulations may relate to taxation and the quality of products and services 
furthermore  the applicability to the internet of existing laws governing intellectual property ownership and infringement  copyright  trademark  trade secret  obscenity  libel  employment  personal privacy and other issues is uncertain and developing 
in addition  we are not certain how our business may be affected by the application of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  encryption and other intellectual property issues  taxation  and export or import matters 
the vast majority of these laws were adopted prior to the advent of the internet 
as a result  they may not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes in laws intended to address these issues could create uncertainty in the internet market 
these uncertainties could reduce demand for our services or increase the cost of doing business through litigation costs or increased service delivery costs 
compliance with new rules and regulations concerning corporate governance may be costly and could harm our business 
the sarbanes oxley act  which was signed into law in july  mandates  among other things  that companies adopt new corporate governance measures and imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers and chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
in addition  the nasdaq national stock market  on which our common stock is listed  is also considering the adoption of additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance 
these laws  rules and regulations will increase the scope  complexity and cost of our corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices  which could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
further  our board members  chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficultly attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which would adversely affect our business 
the current legislative and regulatory environment affecting accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america is uncertain and volatile  and significant changes in current principles could affect our financial statements going forward 
recent actions and public comments from the securities exchange commission have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally 
similarly  the us congress has considered a variety of bills that could affect certain accounting principles 
in addition  the fasb and other regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards  or are developing new proposed standards  such as accounting for guarantees  restructuring charges and stock options  some of which would represent a significant change from current industry practices 
while we believe that our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  we cannot predict the impact of the adoption of any such proposals on our financial statements going forward 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks foreign currency risk 
we have limited exposure to financial market risks  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
although we have foreign operations in europe and asia  to date  our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations has not been significant 
we primarily invoice and settle in us dollars amongst our customers and providers 
we do not participate in any foreign currency hedging activities 
interest rate risk 
our exposure to interest rate risk relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
interest rate risk occurs when we cannot hold a purchased investment to its maturity 
the weighted average maturity of our investment portfolio  when taking into account the reset feature of floating rate municipal bonds  is limited to days 
we intend to hold our securities until maturity and  therefore  do not expect to recognize an adverse impact on income or cash flows  although there can be no assurance of this 
we have established policies and business practices regarding our investment portfolio to preserve principal while obtaining reasonable rates of return without significantly increasing risk 
we place investments with high credit quality issuers according to our investment policy 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
all investments are carried at fair market value for and are considered available for sale 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that there is no material exposure to interest fluctuation 
therefore  no accompanying table has been provided
