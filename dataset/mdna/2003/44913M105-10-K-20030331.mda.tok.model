this incremental charge represents management s estimate of potential loan losses that exceed its historical rate of loan losses 
in the third quarter of  we committed to a profit improvement plan which included the closure of offices around the world in favor of a more cost effective distributor sales model and the termination of our direct manufacturing operations in brazil 
restructuring charges in cost of sales include million related to the write down of inventories and other related costs

non cash compensation was charged in connection with stock options granted to an executive officer 
upon completion of our initial public offering in november  this form of compensation ceased 
in the quarter ended september   we wrote off our remaining million investment in cirilium corporation  a joint corporate venture that we had formed in late with inter tel incorporated 
through september   we had accounted for our investment in cirilium on the equity method and had reported million in losses in connection with this investment 
this write off and the reporting of these losses  in the total amount of million  contributed to our net loss for the year ended december  during  we increased the valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets by million contributing to our loss before discontinued operations  extraordinary item  and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for the period ending december  in the third quarter of  we identified certain unprofitable businesses and  effective with the decision to hold these operating units for sale  recorded a loss of million to write down the assets to fair value 
for comparative purposes  all prior year figures have been restated to reflect the activity of these unprofitable businesses in discontinued operations 
in connection with the early retirement of two term loans  we recorded a million extraordinary loss on early extinguishment of debt 
the extraordinary loss resulted from the write off of unamortized debt issuance costs and a loan discount associated with our term loans

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following sets forth a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations for the three years ended december  this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements 
our actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in exhibit of this annual report on form k entitled cautionary statement regarding forward looking statements and risk factors  in the discussion below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate past judgments and our estimates  including those related to bad debts  product returns  long term contracts  inventories  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  foreign currency  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable in general  we do not have a complex revenue recognition environment requiring significant judgment in order to record revenue 
most of our sales relate to product shipments  which are recognized upon shipment of product pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
service revenues and revenues from long term contracts are each less than of our revenues and we do not have significant judgments or estimates involved in the recording of such revenues 
although we meet the requirements of sab upon shipment of product and the recording of revenue  we continually evaluate our accounts receivable for any bad debts or product returns and make estimates for any bad debt allowances or product return reserves 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
we compute such allowance based upon a specific customer account review of our larger customers and balances in excess of days old 
our assessment of our customers ability to pay generally includes direct contact with the customer  investigation into our customers financial status  as well as consideration of our customers payment history with us 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
if we determine  based on our assessment  that it is more likely than not that our customers will be unable to pay  we will charge off the accounts receivable 

table of contents we record reductions to revenue based on estimates of product returns 
the estimate of product returns is based on historical return trends as well as our assessment of individual customer orders and shipments 
such returns can result from customer nonpayment  in which we request that our product be returned  or a decision on the part of the customer to return the product 
direct financing leases direct financing lease activity is reported in golden eagle 
golden eagle s micro ticket leasing business is characterized by high incidences of delinquencies  which in turn can lead to significant levels of loan losses 
we maintain an allowance for credit losses at an amount that we believe is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our lease portfolio 
our allowance is determined principally on the basis of historical loss experience and management s assessment of the credit quality of the loan portfolio 
we also generally establish a full reserve for customers having a payment past due in excess of days 
if loss rates increase or the credit mix of our portfolio weakens  we may need to increase our allowance for credit losses 
in addition  as part of the initial recording of our direct finance leases  we estimate the unguaranteed residual value of the equipment under finance lease 
this is the estimated fair value of the equipment that will be returned to or purchased from us at the end of the initial lease period 
our estimate of the residual value is based on industry standards and our actual experience 
if market conditions change negatively  it could have an adverse impact on the estimated residual value amount 
sales type leases certain sales of product are sold under a capital lease arrangement  recorded as a sales type lease in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for leases  as amended 
sales type lease revenues consists of the initial sale of the product shipped and the interest and maintenance elements of the lease payments as they are made 
we maintain an allowance for estimated uncollectible sales type lease receivables at an amount that we believe is sufficient to provide adequate protection against losses in our sales type lease portfolio 
our allowance is determined principally on the basis of historical loss experience and management s assessment of the credit quality of the sale type lease customer base 
if loss rates increase or credit conditions at our customers deteriorate  we may need to increase our allowance for uncollectible sales type leases 
any unguaranteed residual value accruing to us at the completion of the sales type lease is recognized at the time the product is returned to us or payment is received to purchase the product 
the residual value for products returned to us is recorded at fair value 
our estimate of fair value is based on an evaluation of market information  including specific evidence of like kind sales where possible 
long term contract revenue we are involved in one long term contract with the brazil health ministry requiring substantial performance of customized software and hardware 
we recognize revenues and an estimated gross profit upon the attainment of scheduled performance milestones 
we follow this method since the contract contains well defined performance milestones and we can make reasonably dependable estimates of the costs applicable to various stages of our contract 
revenues under this contract have been less than of total revenues for each of the fiscal years through the estimated gross profit recorded upon the attainment of scheduled milestones is based upon our estimate of the total gross profit to be recognized over the life of the long term contract 
our gross profit estimates rely on our continuous estimates of total contract costs compared to contract revenue and any claims in excess of contract revenue where it is both probable the claims will result in additional contract revenue and the amount of the excess claim can be reliably estimated 
previously recognized gross profits and the valuation of deferred contract costs are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion and any claims for revenues in excess of the original contract are settled 
revisions in profit estimates and the valuation of deferred contract costs are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
goodwill and other intangible assets on january  we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  sfas 
the adoption of sfas resulted in the complete write off of goodwill balances  existing at january   in the amount of million during the second quarter in accordance with sfas this write off was reported as a cumulative effect of an accounting change in the statement of operations for 
table of contents in accordance with sfas  we amortize our intangible assets over their estimated useful life and assess the recoverability of our intangible assets based on certain assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these intangible assets 
inventory we write down inventory for estimated obsolescence or slow moving inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions generally over a twelve month period on an item by item basis 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred taxes during we recorded a full valuation allowance on our then remaining unreserved deferred tax asset balance due to the impact of a continued economic downturn on our estimated us sourced future income 
as a result  there are no remaining unreserved balances of deferred tax assets reported on the balance sheet as of december  the valuation allowance is subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or  operating profits  in the tax jurisdictions giving rise to the deferred tax assets  become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas accounting for income tax 
the recoverability criteria in sfas requires our judgment of whether it is more likely than not  based on an evaluation of positive and negative evidence  that a valuation allowance is not needed 
if in the future  positive evidence of sufficient quality and quantity overcomes the negative evidence  we would reverse all or a portion of the valuation allowance resulting in a decrease to our income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate the realizability of the deferred tax assets and need for valuation allowances quarterly 
foreign currency a significant portion of our operations is conducted through our international subsidiaries operating in foreign countries 
net revenue from international subsidiaries amounted to for the year ended december  in accordance with the relevant accounting standards we are required to translate the financial statements of our foreign subsidiaries from the currency in which they keep their accounting records  generally the local currency  into the united states dollar 
the treatment of such translation in our financial statements is dependent upon our determination of the functional currency of the foreign subsidiary 
the functional currency is determined based on economic and operational aspects of the foreign subsidiary 
generally  the currency in which the subsidiary transacts a majority of its transactions  including billings  financing  payroll and other expenditures  as well as any dependency upon the parent and the nature of the operations are considered in determining the functional currency 
based on our assessment  we have determined that the functional currency  at this time  is the united states dollar in all of our foreign subsidiaries 
this is principally based on the billing arrangements  dependency on the parent and nature of the operations 
as a result of the functional currency being the united states dollar  any translation gains or losses are recorded in our statements of operations 
as a policy  we hedge the translation of our net investments in foreign subsidiaries in an attempt to neutralize the effect of translation gains or losses on our statements of operations 
financial hedging instruments are limited by company policy to foreign currency forward or option contracts and foreign currency debt 
we enter into forward or option contracts with our banks or other financial institutions to accomplish our hedging strategy 
during  we did not enter into any forward contracts or other instruments to hedge our net investments in foreign subsidiaries as a result of credit limitations imposed on us by our banks 
we also attempt to use natural hedges offsetting local currency assets against liabilities to mitigate our translation losses 
during  we resumed entering into financial instruments to hedge our net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
to the extent the amounts of such currencies hedged differ from the actual amounts exposed to such fluctuations  gains or losses will result in our financial statements 
to the extent our hedging vehicles are not fully effective and or are costly the full benefit may not be achieved and greater fluctuation in our statements of operations will occur 
in addition  to the extent our lenders do not permit us to enter into hedging contracts  we may experience greater levels of gains or losses in our statements of operations as a result of translation 
contingencies and litigation on an ongoing basis management monitors the need to provide an estimated loss contingency arising from normal operations or litigation matters 
there are no such contingencies provided for at december  we rely on our in house counsel and outside counsel to advise us about ongoing litigation matters 
based upon information available at this time  we believe our current litigation matters will not have a material adverse effect on the results of operations and our financial condition 

table of contents overview of financial results during the past three years   and we have incurred substantial net losses 
the following overview will highlight certain key events and factors impacting our financial performance over the past three years year the year was most notably affected by our efforts surrounding the full launch of our ice family of products  our epic initiative  the integration and financing efforts associated with our acquisition of golden eagle leasing inc  and our decision to write off our investment in a corporate joint venture  cirilium corporation 
we also encountered banking restrictions as a result of the significant losses incurred in we expended significant amounts in research and development in connection with the ice family of products and epic 
such efforts contributed to our total expenditures in research and development of million in subsequent to  due to the completion of the core ice and epic development efforts and a shift in focus to product cost reduction efforts over new product introductions  r d spending has been reduced significantly 
by comparison  r d expense in was million  or a reduction from we incurred significant manufacturing costs during the latter half of related to the introduction of the new ice products  higher cost to manufacture in the united states  the transition of manufacturing these products in china  and product reworking and stabilization 
in addition  we were carrying significant amounts of inventory to support both our t series terminal products and the new ice family of products 
the higher inventory levels contributed to increased borrowings and greater interest charges 
the ice family of products has since stabilized and further enhanced with the introduction of our new plus series of terminals 
additionally  inventory levels have decreased from a high during of approximately million to million as of december  we have  with the full completion of this major product transition  gained better visibility and predictability into our inventory requirements for our full product offering 
in january  we acquired golden eagle 
this operation required significantly more cash than anticipated  did not perform as expected  and hampered both our liquidity and profitability during golden eagle s operating loss for was million 
during  we addressed golden eagle s operating deficiencies and effected a securitization transaction to alleviate some of the liquidity pressures relating to this business 
at the end of  we formed a corporate joint venture  cirilium corporation  with another publicly traded company  inter tel incorporated 
in connection with the joint venture  we contributed million and networking technology  and inter tel contributed million and certain telephony technology  all with a goal of creating a company to address service provider applications in the voice over internet protocol voip market 
as a result of changes in market conditions relating to technology companies in general and voip companies in particular  we wrote off our entire investment in cirilium and took a million charge in the quarter ended september  through september   we had accounted for this investment on the equity method  and had recognized million in losses as a result of our interest in cirilium 
this investment was fully written off during and  therefore  we have not recorded any further losses in conjunction with this investment  nor do we have any future obligations 
as a result of losses incurred during the third quarter of  we fell out of compliance with certain covenants in our principal credit agreements 
we became constrained from a liquidity standpoint  which impeded our ability to buy raw materials on a timely basis and required that we move to more expensive sources of raw materials that effectively financed us for longer periods of time 
we also incurred substantially increased interest costs through the imposition of higher interest rates and the payment of forbearance fees 
as discussed further in this overview  we completed a series of financing and equity measures during the first and second quarters of in order to alleviate our liquidity constraints 
year the year was highlighted by our focus on the performance deficiencies at golden eagle and our debt and equity activity 
one of our main objectives was to improve the financial performance of golden eagle 
as a result of our continued focus on golden eagle  we recorded an incremental charge of million in the first quarter of to strengthen credit reserves for certain segments of golden eagles direct finance lease receivables that had been specifically impacted by certain events of that 
table of contents economic period 
this charge was recorded in costs of revenue and is further discussed in our comparison of the years ended december  and our debt and equity activity in began with a series of interim measures to raise cash in anticipation of refinancing our primary credit facility 
these interim measures included the issuance of common stock  and certain bridge borrowings that were ultimately converted to common stock through conversion rights attached to the borrowings  or from the repayment of the bridge borrowings with our common stock 
such financing and equity measures amounted to million 
we completed a refinancing of our principal credit facility in august with a new million senior secured credit facility including a line of credit and two term loans 
although this new facility provided us with increased liquidity  it was a relatively expensive source of capital 
consequently  and as more fully described in our consolidated financial statements  we paid off a significant portion of these facilities with proceeds from a private equity offering completed in march the bridge borrowings and new credit facility included the issuance of stock warrants  which further contributed to our higher interest costs in year the year was highlighted by the completion of a private placement of our common stock  significant charges related to the carrying value of goodwill and deferred tax assets  the implementation of a profit improvement plan and a significant improvement in income from continuing operations 
in the first quarter of  we completed the issuance and sale of common stock in a private equity offering 
net proceeds from the offering of million were used principally to pay off high cost debt 
as a result of the early extinguishment of debt  we recorded an extraordinary charge for the write off of debt issuance costs in the amount of million in the first quarter of on january   we adopted sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
the adoption of sfas resulted in the complete write off of goodwill balances  existing at january   in the amount of million in the second quarter 
in accordance with sfas  this write off was reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the statement of operations 
during the third quarter of  we increased our valuation allowance on our then remaining deferred tax assets by million 
the increase in the valuation allowance has increased our tax expense by million 
there are no remaining balances of deferred tax assets reported on the balance sheet as of december  as discussed further in management s discussion and analysis and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we undertook a profit improvement plan in  which resulted in restructuring certain operations and holding other operations for sale as discontinued operations 
the restructuring costs element of the plan were reported as expenses within income from continuing operations  while the losses from the discontinued operations are reported separately as part of our net loss 
the restructuring charges totaling million included write downs to assets  including inventories and fixed assets  as well as accruals for severance and other operating expenses 
losses from discontinued operations totaling million included the initial write down of assets to fair value  as well as operating results of the discontinued operations during income loss from continuing operations amounted to million  million  and million for year  and respectively  which included the total restructuring charges of million in and the special direct finance lease charge of million in excluding such charges  income loss from continuing operations would have amounted to million  million  and million for year  and respectively 
the following should be read in light of the matters highlighted in the overview 
results of continuing operations the following table sets forth the operating results expressed as a percentage of net revenue for the periods indicated 
results for any one or more periods are not necessarily indicative of future results 

table of contents year ended december  net revenue costs of revenue gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative restructuring charges income loss from continuing operations interest and other income net of interest and other expense foreign currency loss loss from investment in equity affiliate loss before taxes  discontinued operations  extraordinary item  and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle provision benefit for income taxes loss before discontinued operations  extraordinary item  and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle loss from discontinued operations extraordinary item cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net loss net revenue by geographic region is presented in the following table as a percentage of net revenues for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues by region united states latin america  including mexico asia pacific europe totals the results of continuing operations discussed herein exclude the operations of the operating units being reported as discontinued operations see note to the consolidated financial statements 
prior years results of continuing operations have been restated to reflect the discontinued operations on a consistent basis with comparison of years ended december  and net revenue for the year ended december  increased million or to million from million in the same period in the prior year 
as discussed in our comparison of to  net revenues for include the effects of a million reserve for a sales return 
exclusive of the sales return  net revenues would have been further  net revenues include the attainment of a performance milestone under our brazilian health ministry contract resulting in revenue of million during the first quarter of  versus million in revenue recognized under the same contract in exclusive of the revenues for the brazil health ministry contract in both years and the sales return in  net revenues declined during the year ended december  by million compared to this decline is due principally to a decline in revenues from golden eagle of million and a decline in network systems revenues of million  while the pos product group remained relatively 
table of contents flat compared to revenue for golden eagle declined as they funded fewer leases in compared to a result of management s decision to move from lower quality  high volume  high risk lease programs to higher quality  lower volume  less risk lease programs 
while golden eagle is dedicated to growing their funding levels  there can be no assurances golden eagle will increase its funding levels in the future given the prevailing market for qualifying leases 
network system s revenues declined principally as a result of fulfilling substantial orders under one its largest contracts throughout deliveries under such contract declined during as the contract neared completion 
there can be no assurance that network systems will be able to replace this contract in the future with one of equal size or duration 
the remaining milestones under the brazilian health ministry contract are expected to be substantially less than the milestone achieved in the first quarter of  as we are now entering the maintenance phase of this contract 
however  as of december   we have identified and made a claim for approximately million of revenue in excess of the agreed contract 
we believe it is probable our claim will result in additional revenue and have reasonably estimated such amount in accordance with statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
while the revenue related to these claims has not been recorded under our percentage of completion milestone approach  contract costs attributed to these revenue claims amounting to approximately million have been deferred within other long term assets at december  and treated as normal costs of contract performance 
if our revenue claim is denied or results in revenue less than our associated costs  our operating results would be significantly impacted 
net revenues from services activities  principally derived from pos support services  and from our long term contract with the brazilian health ministry  each comprised less than of total net revenue in each of the years ended december  and our cost of revenue includes the cost of raw materials  manufacturing labor  overhead and subcontracted manufacturing costs  as well as interest expense and loan loss provisions with respect to direct financing leases 
the costs of revenue for the year ended december  decreased million or less than to million from million for the year ended december  gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to in the same period in the prior year 
both the change in cost of revenue and the gross margin were affected by various events in both and as discussed previously  included million in revenue from the brazilian health ministry contract versus million recognized in this contract carries a fully absorbed operating margin currently estimated at and thus can impact the overall margin percentage when revenues are inconsistent between periods 
further  costs of revenues included the effects of a million incremental charge to the golden eagle loan loss provision as discussed further in our comparison of year to 
additionally  cost of revenues for includes the effects of restructuring charges in the amount of million relative to our restructuring activity discussed below 
further  in connection with the company s transition of its manufacturing operations in brazil to a contract manufacturer  certain sales orders in the brazilian market were supplied from our factory in china for which importation and tax costs had the effect of decreasing the margin by approximately million in the company also wrote down inventory and incurred other incremental charges relative to assessments of net realizable value amounting to million during the third quarter of exclusive of the brazilian health ministry revenues and related cost of revenues  the golden eagle incremental charge in and the restructuring and other charges incurred during  as noted above  the gross margin for the year ended december  and would be and  respectively 
the increase in is a result of our continued manufacturing and product cost reductions and improved pricing in certain service operations 
research and development expenses consist mainly of software and hardware engineering costs and the cost of development personnel 
research and development expenses for the year ended december  decreased million or to million from million in the same period in the prior year 
the decreases over prior year are directly attributable to a more focused and cost efficient approach to research and development 
since substantially all development activities related to the introduction of the ice product family and the epic initiative are complete  the overall level of research and development activities has been reduced 
present development activities are primarily focusing on reducing the component costs of existing product and to select new product introductions having a commercially feasible market demand 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing expenses  administrative personnel costs  facilities operations and other corporate overhead 
these expenses decreased million or to million for the year ended december  compared to million in this decrease reflects significant cost containment measures put into place during the third quarter of and carrying forward for all of  along with restructuring related savings identified in the 
table of contents third quarter and realized  in part  during the fourth quarter of the cost containment measures and restructuring activities involve both a reduction in staffing as well as the curtailment of discretionary expenses 
in september  the company committed to a plan to improve profits in its pos and network systems segment 
the plan entailed downsizing and outsourcing certain operations and streamlining product offerings  changing to a distributor sales model versus a direct sales model in certain international locations  prioritizing and rationalizing research and development expenditures and disposing of certain unprofitable operations 
the profit improvement plan encompassed both restructuring activities to be accounted and reported under sfas  as well as discontinued operations to be accounted and reported under sfas see note to the financial statements 
the restructuring charges encompassed write downs of fixed assets and inventory  one time termination benefits and other miscellaneous accruals incurred in connection with the company s profit improvement plan 
the following table sets forth the expected costs to be incurred with the activity  the amount incurred during the period and the ending liability as of december  in thousands expected incurred accrued restructuring charges in cost of sales write down of inventories and related costs total restructuring charges in cost of sales restructuring charges write down of building to fair value write down of fixed assets to fair value write down of other assets to fair value one time termination benefits miscellaneous operating accruals total restructuring charges there were no restructuring charges incurred in income from continuing operations for the year ended december  increased million to million compared to a loss from continuing operations of million for the same period in the prior year 
the improvement in operating results is principally from the aforementioned improvement in gross margins coupled with the cost containment measures impacting both research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses 
the company incurred million in interest expense for the year ended december  compared to million for in the prior year 
interest expense for consists primarily of interest expense on long term borrowings and amortization of deferred financing charges 
interest expense for includes essentially the same elements as and also includes amortization of million in loan discounts from warrants issued and amortization of million relating to a beneficial notes payable conversion feature  both related to our refinancing activity during in addition to these amortization charges  the reduction in interest expense in compared to is related to the repayment of two term loans totaling million and a million note from a director and principal stockholder during the first quarter of the repayment was facilitated by proceeds we received from a private placement of common stock in the first quarter of relative to the decrease in interest expense  our total long term debt has decreased from million at december  to million at december  other income expense in the amount of million for the year ended december  consisted principally of losses on fixed asset sales of million  net of credits relating to corporate overhead charges allocated to discontinued operations of million 
income and expense in the amount of million for the year ended december  consisted primarily of charges associated with requirements under our debt forbearance agreements and other default related costs of million and corporate overhead charges to discontinued operations of million 
during the company was not in default with its lenders and accordingly did not incur similar default related charges 
the corporate overhead charges to discontinued operations were ceased at the time the discontinued operations were declared held for sale in september 
table of contents foreign currency losses totaling million for the year ended december  were largely attributable to the devaluation of the brazilian real and argentinean peso partially offset by gains in the british pound 
foreign currency losses for the year ended december  of million related to general currency declines in europe and south america 
there was no significant devaluation of currencies impacting beginning in june of the company resumed its foreign currency risk management strategy  which had been suspended starting in due to financial restrictions 
at december   the company had foreign currency forward contracts outstanding in the amount of million  denominated principally in the brazilian real and british pound 
gains and losses on these contracts are principally consisting of our mark to market adjustments  recorded in net earnings as foreign currency gains or losses 
during the third quarter of we recorded a full valuation allowance on our then remaining unreserved deferred tax asset balance of approximately million 
we further increased our valuation allowance in for net increases in deferred tax assets that occurred principally by charges to expense that are not currently deductible or recoverable 
the increase in the valuation allowance was based on the weight of all available evidence  principally influenced by the continued us derived losses in the third quarter of coupled with a continuing extension of the us recession as well as cumulative us derived losses in recent years 
the us derived losses in the third quarter of and cumulatively over recent years together with an uncertain economic outlook for the us  were deemed to be significant negative evidence 
as a result  the company determined it did not meet the more likely than not recoverability criteria in sfas no 
 accounting for income tax  requiring positive evidence of sufficient quality and quantity to overcome the negative evidence in order to support a conclusion that a valuation allowance is not needed 
the valuation allowance is subject to reversal in future years at such time that the benefits are actually utilized or  the operating profits in the us become sustainable at a level that meets the recoverability criteria under sfas there are no remaining unreserved balances of deferred tax assets reported on the balance sheet as of december  in addition to deferred tax expenses which principally relate to our valuation allowance increases  the income tax provision for the year ended december  is comprised of income tax expenses from foreign locations with taxable income and a current tax benefit for certain us losses that can be carried back for refunds 
as a result of this combination of occurrences the effective tax rate for the company in is not meaningful 
the company s effective rate of income tax benefit was for the year ended december  the income tax benefit rate in differed from the us statutory rate principally due to foreign taxes attributable to foreign operations that are less than the us statutory rate  research and experimentation credits  the non recognition of tax benefit on foreign currency translation losses and valuation reserves 
comparison of years ended december  and net revenue for the year ended december   decreased million or to million from million for the year ended december  this decrease was principally due to the combined effect of a delay in the receipt of certain key components during the nine month period ended september   caused by constraints on cash relative to our default position with our primary bank group and the tragic events of september  and an unusually high level of orders received from latin american customers in the nine month period ended september   which did not recur in in addition  we reduced sales during the fourth quarter ended december  by million to reflect a reserve for product returns 
this reserve for product returns related to one particular customer whereby we decided to take back product for the purpose of providing additional product features and enhancements 
these new features and enhancements were not included in the specifications at the date of the original sales  and we were not required to make the modifications under the terms of the original sale 
we elected to make a customer concession and provide the enhancements and have recorded this as a product return 
gross profit was reduced by million dollars during the fourth quarter ended december  as a result of this sales return 
as the product is modified and determined to meet the customer s revised requirements  we will record sales when all requirements of sab are met 
net revenues from services activities  principally derived from pos support services and from our long term contract with the brazilian health ministry  each comprised less than of total net revenue in each of the years ended december  and our cost of revenue includes the cost of raw materials  manufacturing labor  overhead and subcontracted manufacturing costs  as well as interest expense and loan loss provisions with respect to direct financing leases 
for the year ended december   costs of revenue decreased million or to million from million for the year ended december  interest expense included in cost of revenues amounted to million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and loan loss provisions included in cost of revenue amounted to million and million  respectively  for the years ended december  and 
table of contents gross margin for the year ended december  was compared to in the same period in the prior year 
this decrease in gross margin was primarily attributed to the lower revenues  including the effects of our sales return discussed as part of the decrease in net revenues from to  and an incremental charge of million to strengthen credit reserves for certain segments of golden eagle s direct finance lease receivables 
this incremental charge represents management s estimate of potential loan losses that exceed its historical rate of loan losses 
the following factors contributed to golden eagle s decision in the first quarter of to strengthen credit reserves several new vendor programs that were established in and that contributed significantly to funding volume in  were experiencing losses at higher levels than historic loss levels for other vendor programs 
these programs involved independent sales organizations providing additional services to the merchants lessees as part of the lease program 
if service levels were not as the merchants expected  the likelihood of their making required lease payments was reduced 
losses for these programs began to exceed historical levels for the quarter ended march   leases funded for electronic payments software  such as payment software loaded into a personal computer without the need for a terminal  were at higher funding levels in than in previous years 
performance on these leases worsened in the first quarter of  the overall credit mix of the portfolio was slightly skewed by a few percentage points toward higher risk credits  commonly described as c and d rated credits 
c and d credit leases booked in the year appeared to be performing significantly worse than c and d credits in previous years as we analyzed activity through march   and the overall softening of the economy at the start of  coupled with the results of our analysis of collection status and default trends as of march   also contributed to the conclusion that the increase in reserves would be appropriate 
golden eagle s micro ticket leasing business is characterized by high incidences of delinquencies  which in turn can lead to significant levels of loan losses 
however  based on historical default rates and our credit assessments  we believe collectibility of the minimum lease payments is reasonably predictable 
exclusive of the million incremental credit reserve  the gross margin percentage for the year ended december  increased to 
this increase was primarily attributable to the stabilization of the ice product family during during the year ended december   we experienced margins of approximately through june  due to a larger portion of sales from the higher margin legacy products 
this higher margin through june  was offset during the third quarter of by the shift in product mix toward the lower margin ice product  increased manufacturing costs due to the greater than anticipated manufacturing volumes in the us versus china  transition costs of moving the production for the ice product family to china  higher component costs resulting from increased purchases from distributors who offered extended credit terms but at higher prices and costs related to reworking and stabilizing the new screen based family of terminals 
our research and development expenses consist mainly of software and hardware engineering costs and the cost of development personnel 
our research and development expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was directly attributable to our cost cutting efforts of reducing personnel and curtailing spending for research and development materials 
since substantially all development activities related to the introduction of the interactive consumer environment ice product family and the epic initiative were completed in  the overall level of research and development activities has been reduced 
present development activities are primarily focusing on reducing the component costs of existing products and to a much lesser extent  new product introductions 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist of sales and marketing expenses  administrative personnel costs  facilities operations  and other corporate overheads 
these expenses totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this million or decrease is attributable to lower revenue related expense savings and other cost containment measures 
for the year ended december   the loss from continuing operations of million compares to a loss of million for the prior year 
this improvement results primarily from reductions in research and development and selling  general and administrative expenses of million offset in part by the decrease in gross margin of million 

table of contents for the year ended december   interest income of million consisted primarily of returns on short and long term investments 
we incurred interest expense of million which consisted primarily of interest expense on borrowings for notes payable  long term debt  amortization of debt issuance costs and loan discounts on warrants issued  and the amortization of a beneficial conversion feature on convertible notes payable 
other income expense in the amount of million consisted primarily of charges associated with the requirements under the forbearance and modification agreement between us and our principal lenders and other related costs associated with being in default with our lenders 
foreign currency losses of million resulted principally from the unfavorable translation of our net foreign investments in brazil and the united kingdom 
further  as a result of being in default with our lenders  we were unable to continue our hedging strategies during the year ended december  for the year ended december   the income tax benefit for federal  state and foreign taxes was million  or of our loss before income taxes 
the benefit for federal  state and foreign taxes was million  or of our loss before income taxes for the year ended december  our income tax benefit is different than the us federal statutory rate due to the mix in which jurisdictions certain taxable income or losses were incurred  the impact of research and experimentation credits  and charges relating to the estimated portion of certain deferred tax assets that management estimates may not be recoverable 
liquidity and capital resources the company has historically financed its operations primarily through cash generated from operations and from borrowings under a line of credit 
the company has also used securitization conduits to finance lease receivables generated by its subsidiary golden eagle leasing  as well as borrowings under notes payable to fund working capital requirements and reduce its bank debt 
cash provided by continuing operations increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the principal reason for the change in operating cash flow between and was our improved results from continuing operations offset in part by a net increase in working capital 
our working capital increase during resulted from decreases in accounts payable from december  the accounts payable balances at december  were higher than normal stemming from our refinancing activities and conservation of cash efforts necessary in cash used in investing activities decreased million to million for the year ended december  from cash used in investing activities of million in the same period a year ago 
this decrease is primarily related to a decrease in cash required to fund the company s direct financing leases in the amount of million resulting from a continued focus on higher quality leases at less volume  offset by an increase in purchases of property  plant and equipment of million 
increases in property  plant and equipment relate to leasehold improvements and software upgrades 
cash used in financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash used in financing activities of million in the same period a year ago 
this change is principally attributable to the net advances to the operating units in discontinued operations in the amount of million 
excluding such advances financing activities have improved due to the company s ability to utilize its million revolving credit facility  which was significantly restricted in due to non compliance with certain financial covenants 
additionally  the company was able to significantly reduce its long term debt to million from million at december   with proceeds from the private issuance and sale of stock in the first quarter of  as discussed below 
at december  working capital and cash were and million  respectively  compared to and million at december   respectively 
on march   the company completed the issuance and sale of  shares of its common stock  par value per share the shares  at a price of per share 
the shares were sold in a private transaction exempt from registration under section of the securities act of  as amended 
the shares were subsequently registered with the securities and exchange commission effective may  the net proceeds of the private offering amounted to million and were used to repay two term loans with principal balances of million and million  respectively  under the company s credit facility  million in outstanding loans from a director and principal stockholder and to reduce the outstanding borrowings under the company s million revolving credit facility 
the remaining proceeds were used for general corporate purposes 

table of contents further  in connection with the private offering  the company entered into an agreement with its principal lenders relating to its revolving credit facility which waived any default or event of default with respect to the delivery of certain collateral documents that the company was obligated to deliver under the facility and permitted the company to repay the term loans 
the effective date of the amendment was march  the company continues to accelerate cash generation through aggressively pursuing collection of trade receivables  reducing inventories and controlling expenses 
we believe that our cash flow from operations  and the net cash provided by our direct financing leases  together with our current cash reserves  will be sufficient to fund our projected liquidity and capital resource requirements through if operating results are unfavorable or our direct financing lease fundings exceed direct financing lease receipts  we may need to use additional capital sources to meet our short term liquidity and capital resource requirements 
these additional sources would include our existing credit facilities  including our million revolving line of credit  which is available based on certain accounts receivable and inventory balances  or our direct financing lease credit facilities with approximately million of credit available at december  backlog as of december   our backlog was million  compared to million at december  this decrease is due to deliveries under prior sales orders  particularly  our brazilian heath ministry contract 
the company includes in its backlog all revenue specified in signed contracts and purchase orders to the extent that the company contemplates recognition of the related revenue within one year 
there can be no assurance that the contracts included in backlog will actually generate the specified revenues or that the actual revenues will be generated within the one year period

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates in connection with our foreign operations and markets 
nevertheless  the fair value of our investment portfolio or related income would not be significantly impacted by either a basis point increase or decrease in interest rates  due primarily to the short term nature of the major portion of our investment portfolio

however  we do at times enter into these transactions in other currencies  such as the hong kong dollar  australian dollar  brazilian real  british pound and other asian and european currencies 
beginning in june  the company resumed its foreign currency risk management strategy  which had been suspended starting the fourth quarter of due to credit limitations imposed by the company s banks
