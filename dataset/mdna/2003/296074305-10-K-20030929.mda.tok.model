as a result of the approval  the company began marketing the system through its joint venture with megavision 
the company terminated its joint venture with megavision and commenced operations within its emi business unit on january  cfa camera back the images furnished by the cfa camera system furnish a very high level of detail 
the camera back is being marketed to medical institutions  educational institutions and ophthalmologists for the purpose of diagnosis of retinal disorders 
pharmaceutical business the company obtained the license and distribution rights for povidone iodine solution from harbor ucla medical center 
povidone iodine solution is a broad spectrum anti microbial intended to prevent ophthalmia neonatorum in newborns 
the product required further development before achieving fda approval 
having exhausted all partnering possibilities  during fiscal it was decided that further expenditures on this project were not in the shareholders best interest and the project was abandoned 
the decision resulted in the company taking a charge of  which included the write off of the remaining net book value of the license and distribution rights subject to normal amortization 
research and development escalon conducts medical device and vascular access product development at its new berlin  wisconsin facility located near milwaukee 
the development of ultrasound ophthalmic equipment is performed at the company s lake success  new york facility located on long island 
research and development expenditures for the fiscal years ended june   and were   and  respectively 
manufacturing and distribution escalon leases  square feet of space in new berlin  wisconsin  near milwaukee  for its surgical products and vascular access operations 
the facility is currently used for engineering  product design and development  manufacturing and product assembly 
the company subcontracts component manufacture  assembly and sterilization to various vendors 
manufacturing facilities include a class  clean room 
a class  clean room is a controlled environment for producing devices while avoiding any significant contaminants 
the cleanliness provided by this class  clean room exceeds the requirements of the fda 
all of the company s ophthalmic surgical products and vascular access products are distributed from its wisconsin facility 
the company designs  develops and services its ultrasound ophthalmic products at its facility in lake success  new york 
this facility contains  square feet 
the company pursued and achieved iso certification at both of its manufacturing facilities for all medical and ultrasound devices produced 
iso requires an implemented quality system that applies to product design 
these certifications can be obtained only after a complete audit of a company s quality system by an independent outside auditor 
these certifications require that these facilities undergo periodic reexamination 
european community ce certification has been obtained for disposable delivery systems  fiber optic light probes  vascular access products and certain ultrasound models 
the manufacture  testing and marketing of each of the company s products entails risk of product liability 
product liability insurance is carried by escalon to cover the primary risk 
governmental regulations escalon s products are subject to stringent ongoing regulation by the fda and similar health authorities  and if the fda s approvals or clearances of the company s products are restricted or revoked the company could face delays that would impair the company s ability to generate funds from operations 
the fda and similar health authorities in foreign countries extensively regulate escalon s activities 
the company must obtain either k clearances or pre market approvals and new drug application approvals prior to marketing a product in the united states 
foreign regulation also requires that we obtain other approvals from foreign government agencies prior to the sale of products in those countries 
also  escalon may be required to obtain fda approval before exporting a product or device that has not received fda marketing clearance or approval 
escalon has received the necessary fda approvals for all products that the company currently markets 
any restrictions on or revocation of the fda approvals and clearances that the company has obtained  however  would prevent the continued marketing of the impacted products and other devices 
the restrictions or revocations could result from the discovery of previously unknown problems with the product 
consequently  the fda revocation would impair the company s ability to generate funds from operations 
the fda and comparable agencies in state and local jurisdictions and in foreign countries impose substantial requirements upon the manufacturing and marketing of pharmaceutical and medical device equipment and related disposables  including the obligation to adhere to the fda s good manufacturing practice regulations 
compliance with these regulations requires time consuming detailed validation of manufacturing and quality control processes  fda periodic inspections and other procedures 
if the fda finds any deficiencies in the validation processes  for example  the fda may impose restrictions on marketing the affected products until such deficiencies are corrected 
escalon has received ce approval on several of the company s products that allows the company to sell the products in the countries comprising the european community 
in addition to the ce mark  however  some foreign countries may require separate individual foreign regulatory clearances 
escalon cannot assure that the company will be able to obtain regulatory clearances for other products in the united states or foreign markets 
the process for obtaining regulatory clearances and approvals and underlying clinical studies for any new products or devices and for multiple indications for existing products is lengthy and will require substantial commitments of our financial resources and our management s time and effort 
any delay in obtaining clearances or approvals or any changes in existing regulatory requirements would materially adversely affect the company s business 
escalon s failure to comply with applicable regulations would subject the company to fines  delays or suspensions of approvals or clearances  seizures or recalls of products  operating restrictions  injunctions or civil or criminal penalties  which would affect adversely the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
marketing and sales the medical trek business unit sells its ophthalmic devices and instrument products directly to end users through internal sales and marketing employees located at the company s wisconsin facility 
sales are primarily to teaching institutions  key hospitals and eye surgery centers focusing primarily on physicians and operating room personnel performing vitreoretinal surgery 
vascular access products are marketed domestically through internal sales and marketing employees located in pennsylvania  illinois and at its wisconsin facility  as well as through five independent distributors and sales representatives located in florida  missouri  ohio and washington managed by the company s sales team

limited warranties are given on all products against defects and performance 
product repairs are made at the wisconsin facility for surgical devices and vascular access products and emi devices 
sonomed s products are serviced at the new york facility 
third party reimbursement it is expected that physicians and hospitals will purchase the company s ophthalmic products and that they in turn will bill various third party payers for health care services provided to their patients 
these payers include medicare  medicaid and private insurers 
government agencies generally reimburse health care providers at a fixed rate based on the procedure performed 
third party payers may deny reimbursement if they determine that a procedure performed using any one of the company s products was unnecessary  inappropriate  not cost effective  experimental or used for a non approved indication 
patents  trademarks and licenses the pharmaceutical and medical device communities place considerable importance on obtaining patent and trade secret protection for new technologies  products and processes for the purpose of strengthening the company s position in the market place and protecting the company s economic interests 
the company s policy is to protect its technology by aggressively obtaining patent protection for all of its developments and products  both in the united states and in selected countries outside the united states 
it is the company s policy to file for patent protection in those foreign countries in which the company believes such protection is necessary to protect its economic interests 
twenty one united states issued patents  and nineteen patents issued abroad cover the company s surgical products and pharmaceutical technology 
with respect to the company s ultrafast laser technology licensed to a privately held company  sixteen patents have been issued in the united states and eleven overseas 
vascular access products are covered by eighteen patents  which provide protection in the united states  europe  japan and other countries overseas 
the company intends to vigorously defend its patents if the need arises 
while in the aggregate the company s patents are of material importance to its business taken as a whole  the patents  trademarks and licenses that are most critical to the company s ability to generate revenues are as follows the escalon trademark is due for renewal on january   and the company intends to renew the trademark 
the sonomed trademark is due for renewal on april  and the company intends to renew the trademark 
in the vascular business  the company has two patents that are of material importance 
the first patent is the apparatus for the cannulation of blood vessels 
this patent will expire on february  the second patent is also an apparatus for the cannulation of blood vessels 
this patent will expire on january  the company licensed its ultrafast laser systems to a privately held company 
the material patents will expire between and the material terms of the ultrafast laser systems license are that in exchange for the use of the company s licensed laser patents escalon will receive a royalty on future product sales that are based on the licensed laser patents  subject to deductions for royalties payable to third parties up to a maximum of of royalties otherwise due and payable to the company and a royalty on product sales that are not based on the licensed laser patents 
the company receives a minimum annual license fee of  per year during the term of the license 
the minimum annual license fee is offset against the royalty payments 
the license was dated october   and was amended and restated in october and expires upon the latest to occur of the following events the last to expire of the licensed patents  ten years from the effective date of the amended and restated agreement  or the fifth anniversary date of the date of the first commercial sale 
the material termination provisions of the license are as follows the default in payment of any royalty  the default in the making of any required report  making of any false report  the commission of any material breach of any covenant or promise under the license agreement  or the termination of the license by the licensee at any time after days notice 
if the licensee were to terminate it would not be permitted to utilize the licensed technology necessary to manufacture its current products 
the duration of the company s patents  trademarks and licenses vary through competition there are numerous direct and indirect competitors of the company in the united states and abroad 
these companies include ophthalmic oriented companies that market a broad portfolio of products including prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals  ophthalmic devices  consumer products such as contact lens cleaning solution and other eye care products  large integrated pharmaceutical companies that market a limited number of ophthalmic pharmaceuticals in addition to many other pharmaceuticals  and smaller specialty pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies that are engaged in the development and commercialization of prescription ophthalmic pharmaceuticals and products and  to some extent  drug delivery systems 
the company s competitors for medical devices and ophthalmic pharmaceuticals include  but are not limited to  bausch lomb  inc  alcon laboratories  inc  paradigm medical  inc  quantel  inc and accutome  inc 
several large companies dominate the ophthalmic market  with the balance of the industry being highly fragmented 
the company believes that these large companies capture approximately of the overall ophthalmic market 
the balance of the market is comprised of smaller companies ranging from start up entities to established market players 
the ophthalmic market in general is intensely competitive  with each company eager to expand its market share 
the company s strategy is to compete primarily on the basis of technological innovation to which it has proprietary rights 
the company believes  therefore  that its success will depend in large part on protecting its intellectual property through patents and other governmental regulations 
the company recognizes that there are other innovative companies that may develop competitive strategies 
sonomed designs and manufactures ophthalmic ultrasound products a scans  pachymeters and b scans 
the a scans and pachymeters furnish internal measurements of the eye and b scans provide an image of the rear of the eye 
the principal competitors are alcon laboratories  inc  quantel  inc 
and accutome  inc management believes the company is in a market leadership position 
sonomed has had a leading presence in the industry for over thirty years 
management believes this has helped the company build a reputation as a long standing operation that provides a quality product  which has enabled the company to establish effective distribution coverage within the united states market 
the company seeks to preserve its position in the market through continued product enhancement 
various competitors offering similar products at a lower price can threaten sonomed s market position 
the development of laser technologies for ophthalmic biometrics and imaging may also diminish the company s market position 
this equipment can be used instead of ultrasound equipment in most  but not all  patients 
such equipment  however  is more expensive 
the trek business sells a broad range of ophthalmic surgical products 
the more significant products are ispan r gases and delivery systems 
trek also manufactures various ophthalmic surgical products for major ophthalmic companies to be sold under their name 
to remain competitive the company needs to maintain a low cost operation 
there are numerous other companies that can provide this manufacturing service 
there are a variety of other devices that directly compete with sonomed s ultrasound products and the camera back marketed by emi 
the vascular access product line is comprised of disposable devices  and currently it has no direct competition 
however  a significantly higher priced non disposable device that facilitates vascular access is currently being marketed 
vascular produces the only device that can be accommodated within a standard needle for assisting medical practitioners in gaining access to a vessel in the human vascular system 
there are no similar devices in the market that enable medical practitioners in gaining access using their normal procedures 
the only similar product utilizes a separate ultrasound monitor  but no disposables are needed 
when using the competing device  medical practitioners need to look at the monitor while advancing the needle into the patient 
the perceived disadvantage of the company s vascular product is that its retail price is substantially greater than the cost of a traditional needle 
human resources as of june   the company employed full time employees and part time employee 
thirty two of the company s employees are employed in manufacturing  are employed in general and administrative positions  eight are employed in sales and marketing and six are employed in research and development 
escalon s employees are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement  and the company considers its relationship with its employees to be good 
cautionary factors that may affect future results certain statements contained in this annual report on form k and other written and oral statements made from time to time by the company do not relate strictly to historical or current facts 
as such  they are considered forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  which provide current expectations or forecasts of future events 
such statements can be identified by the use of terminology such as anticipate  believe  could  estimate  expect  forecast  intend  may  plan  possible  protect  should  will  and similar words or expressions 
the company s forward looking statements include certain information relating to general business strategy  growth strategies  financial results  liquidity  product development  the introduction of new products  the potential markets and uses for the company s products  the company s regulatory filings applications with the fda  the development of joint venture opportunities  the effect of competition on the structure of the markets in which the company competes and defending itself in litigation matters 
one must carefully consider forward looking statements and understand that such statements involve a variety of risks and uncertainties  known and unknown  and may be affected by assumptions that fail to materialize as anticipated 
consequently  no forward looking statement can be guaranteed  and actual results may vary materially 
it is not possible to foresee or identify all factors affecting the company s forward looking statements  and you therefore should not consider any list of such factors to be an exhaustive statement of all risks  uncertainties or potentially inaccurate assumptions 
the company undertakes no obligation to update any forward looking statement 
although it is not possible to create a comprehensive list of all factors that may cause actual results to differ from the company s forward looking statements  the most important factors include  without limitation  the following future capital needs and the uncertainty of additional funding escalon s liquidity is affected by many factors  some of which are based on the normal ongoing operations of the company s businesses and some of which arise from fluctuations related to global markets and economies 
the company s current term loan with the privately held financial group provides for quarterly principal payments  which increase every twelve months  including a  final balloon payment  which is due on september  the company believes that cash on hand plus cash available from the company s line of credit will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital  capital expenditures and research and development until the balloon payment is due 
the company may be required to secure additional debt or equity financing in order to satisfy the balloon payment  and the company cannot assure that such financing will be available when required on acceptable terms 
concentration of revenues escalon realized and of its net revenue during the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively  from bausch lomb s sale of silicone oil 
while management does not expect this revenue to decline rapidly in the immediate future  any such decrease would have a significant impact on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows and the company s stock price could be negatively impacted 
the company is entitled to receive this revenue from bausch lomb  in varying amounts  through fiscal see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information regarding the silicone oil revenue from bausch lomb 
economic and regulatory conditions and the competitive nature of the industries in which the company competes it is difficult to ascertain if the current economic climate has affected the company s results 
management believes that any effect has been limited to the company s sonomed business unit 
should it become necessary due to economic climate  the company cannot assure you that it will be able to reduce expenditures quickly enough to maintain profitability and service the company s current debt 
in addition  there is a risk that cost cutting initiatives will impair the company s ability to effectively develop and market products and remain competitive in the industries in which the company competes 
these measures could have long term effects on escalon s business by decreasing or slowing improvements in the company s products  making it more difficult to respond to customers  limiting the company s ability to increase production quickly and limiting the company s ability to hire and retain key personnel 
these circumstances could cause the company s earnings to be lower than they otherwise might be 
the company could be affected by trends toward managed care  health care cost containment  and other changes in government and private sector initiatives  in the united states and other countries in which the company does business  that are placing increased emphasis on the delivery of more cost effective medical therapies 
changes in governmental laws  regulations  and accounting standards and the enforcement thereof and agency or government actions or investigations involving the industry in general or the company in particular may be adverse to the company 
international business activity the company derives a portion of its revenues from sales outside the united states 
changes in the laws or policies of governmental and quasi governmental agencies  as well as social and economic conditions  in the countries in which the company operates could affect the company s business in these countries and the company s results of operations 
in addition  economic factors including inflation and fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates and competitive factors such as price competition  business combinations of competitors or a decline in industry sales from continued economic weakness both in the united states and other countries in which the company conducts business could affect the company s results of operations 
the ability of the company to successfully develop and market new products escalon generally sells its products in industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product introductions and changing industry standards 
without timely introduction of new products and enhancements  escalon s products will become technologically obsolete over time  in which case the company s revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of escalon s new product offerings will depend on several factors  including the company s ability to i properly identify customer needs  ii innovate and develop new technologies  services and applications  iii successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  iv manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes on time  v differentiate the company s offerings from our competitors offerings  vi price the company s products competitively  and vii anticipate competitors announcements of new products  services or technological innovations 
dependence on key personnel escalon s future success depends partly on the continued service of the company s key research  engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  executive and administrative personnel 
if escalon fails to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel  the company will not be able to maintain or expand its business 
escalon s acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures may result in financial results that are different than expected in the normal course of business  escalon engages in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  joint ventures and divestitures 
as a result of such transactions  the company s financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and alliances may require escalon to integrate a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure 
we may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of the company s combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  escalon s successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors including i the retention of key employees  and ii the management of facilities and employees in separate geographical areas 
all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert the company s attention from other business operations 
if escalon does not realize the expected benefits or synergies of such transactions  the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations and stock price could be negatively impacted 
the outcome of litigation matters and uncertain protection of patented and proprietary information increased public interest in recent years in product liability claims in the medical device industry could affect the company should it become directly involved in such lawsuits 
recent events have made the investing public particularly sensitive to listed companies reporting practices and accounting policies in general 
additionally  the company may find it necessary to enforce its legal rights with respect to patented and proprietary information 
the outcome of any of these matters and the financial impact they may have on the company cannot be foreseen 
volatility of stock price and the ability of the escalon to maintain the company s listing on the nasdaq smallcap market the public stock markets have experienced significant volatility in stock prices in recent years  which could cause the company s stock price to experience severe price changes that are unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the company 
the trading price of the company s common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to  among other factors  quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  announcements of new strategic relationships by the company or its competitors  general conditions in the healthcare industry or the global economy generally  or market volatility unrelated to the company s business and operating results 
the company s common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
in order to continue to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market  certain listing requirements must be met and maintained 
if escalon s securities were delisted  investors could find it more difficult to trade in the company s securities  or to obtain accurate quotations as to the market value of the company s securities

escalon operates primarily in four reportable business segments sonomed  vascular  medical trek and emi 
sonomed develops  manufactures and markets ultrasound systems used for diagnostic or biometric applications in ophthalmology 
vascular develops  manufactures and markets vascular access products 
medical trek develops  manufactures and distributes ophthalmic surgical products under the escalon medical corp 
and or trek medical products names 
emi manufactures and markets a digital camera system for ophthalmic fundus photography 
for a more complete description of these businesses and their products  see item business 
results of operations fiscal year ended june  compared to fiscal year ended june  the following table presents consolidated product revenues by business segment as well as identifying trends in business segment product revenues for the fiscal years ended june  and fiscal years ended june  change in thousands product revenues sonomed   vascular   medical trek   emi product revenues increased  or  to  in fiscal as compared to  in fiscal product revenues in the sonomed business unit increased  or  to  the increase is attributed to a  increase in the domestic market as well as a  increase in asia and the pacific rim 
the surge in the domestic market primarily relates to increased demand for the company s pachymeter product 
usage of pachymeters has recently been expanded to include glaucoma screening  opening a new market for the product 
the increase in asia and the pacific rim relates primarily to the company s successful strategy of increased penetration of those geographic areas 
conversely  sonomed has experienced a  decrease in revenue in latin america as well as a  decrease in the middle east 
management believes that the weak economy in latin america and the turmoil in the middle east have led to these decreases 
product revenue in the vascular business unit increased  or  to  the increase relates primarily to increased usage in the marketplace 
during fiscal  the company identified certain underperforming distributors within its vascular business unit and terminated its relationship with them 
subsequent to terminating these distributors  the company began direct selling in the territories once covered by the distributors 
management believes that revenues in the territories once covered by the distributors have remained stable or increased  as revenue in the vascular business unit increased for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  during the fiscal year ended june   revenue continued to build upon this increased base 
product revenue in the medical trek business unit increased  or  to  oem revenue from bausch lomb increased  on december   the company announced that it received k clearance to begin marketing its high end digital camera system for ophthalmologists known as the cfa digital imaging system 
as a result of the approval  the company began marketing the system through its joint venture with megavision 
escalon terminated its joint venture with megavision and commenced operations within the company s emi business unit on january  product revenue in the emi business unit increased  the company terminated its joint venture and commenced operations within the emi business unit on january   and therefore  during the first six months of fiscal  these revenues were recognized within the joint venture 
other revenue  which is included in the medical trek business unit  increased  or  to  for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to  for the fiscal year ended june  the increase primarily relates to a  increase in royalty payments received from a privately held entity related to the licensing of escalon s intellectual laser technology 
escalon licensed the technology to the privately held company in october these royalty payments commenced during the fourth quarter of fiscal when the privately held company began selling products related to the company s intellectual laser technology 
the remaining  increase in other revenue relates to revenue earned from bausch lomb in connection with silicone oil 
the company s contract with bausch lomb calls for annual step downs in the calculation of silicone oil revenues to be received by the company 
these step downs occur during the first quarter of each fiscal year through the remainder of the contract 
for the fiscal year ended june   the step down caused a  decrease in silicone oil revenue that escalon would have otherwise received had the step down not occurred 
the offsetting  increase in silicone oil revenue is due to increase in the market demand for the product 
escalon does not have knowledge as to what factors have affected bausch lomb s sales of silicone oil 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of the step down provisions under the contract with bausch lomb

cost of goods sold in the vascular business unit totaled  or of net revenue  for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to  or of net revenue  for the fiscal year ended june  vascular s margins have been adversely affected by several factors including product mix  having experienced an increase in sales of the over the needle catheter onc product line  which has lower margins than the remainder of the vascular product line due to smaller scale production  lower price per unit  having experienced an increase in sales to distributors to whom the company discounts its products  and quality issues that led to the company writing off  of inventory in the fourth quarter of fiscal cost of goods sold in the medical trek business unit totaled  or of net revenue  for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to  or of net revenue  for the fiscal year ended june  when other revenue is excluded no costs are associated with these revenue streams  cost of goods sold  as a percentage of product revenue  was and for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively

in the medical trek business unit  marketing  general and administrative expenses decreased  or  for the fiscal year ended june  as compared to the fiscal year ended june  legal and accounting fees decreased  legal fees were unusually high during the fiscal year ended june  due to required filings with the sec related to the reincorporation into pennsylvania  the issuance of escalon common stock shares to endologix  inc salaries and other personnel related expenses decreased  primarily the result of reduced headcount 
also contributing to the decrease  the company began allocating from the medical trek business unit certain overhead expenses related to the wisconsin facility to the vascular business unit 
offsetting these decreases was a  increase in insurance expense

 discussed further in notes and of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k

for example  estimates are used in determining valuation allowances for uncollectible receivables  obsolete inventory  sales returns and rebates  deferred income taxes and purchased intangible assets 
actual results achieved in the future could differ from current estimates 
the company used what it believes are reasonable assumptions and  where applicable  established valuation techniques in making its estimates 
revenue recognition escalon s standard arrangement for the company s domestic and international customers includes a signed purchase order or contract and no right of return of delivered products without consent of the company 
revenue from sales of product is recognized when the company enters into a legally binding arrangement with a customer  the company delivers the products  customer payment is deemed fixed and determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  and collection is probable escalon assesses collectibility based on the credit worthiness of the customer and past transaction history 
the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and does not require collateral from its customers 
for many of escalon s international customers  the company requires an irrevocable letter of credit to be issued by the customer before the purchase order is accepted 
valuation of intangible assets escalon periodically evaluates its intangible assets and goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
these intangible assets include goodwill  trademarks and trade names 
factors the company considers important that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to historical or projected future operating results or significant negative industry or economic trends 
if these criteria indicate that the value of the intangible asset may be impaired  an evaluation of the recoverability of the net carrying value of the asset is made 
if this evaluation indicates that the intangible asset is not recoverable  the net carrying value of the related intangible asset will be reduced to fair value 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on the company s reported financial statements if and when an impairment charge is recorded 
no impairment losses were recorded for goodwill  trademarks and trade names during any of the periods presented based on these evaluations 
deferred taxes the deferred tax valuation allowance is based on our assessment of the realizability of our deferred tax assets on an ongoing basis and may be adjusted from time to time as necessary 
in determining the valuation allowance  we have considered future taxable income and the feasibility of tax planning initiatives and strategies 
should we determine that it is more likely than not that we will realize certain of our deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment would be required to reduce the existing valuation allowance and increase income 
on the contrary  if we determine that we would not be able to realize our recorded deferred tax asset  an adjustment to increase our valuation allowance would be charged to the results of operations in the period such conclusion was made 
such charge could have an adverse effect on our provision for income taxes included in our results of operations
