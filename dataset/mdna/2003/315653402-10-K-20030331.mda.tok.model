item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we deploy  own and operate fiber optic networks designed to provide comprehensive broadband connectivity for data  voice and video transmission to service providers in major metropolitan areas 
these networks provide an advanced  high bandwidth fiber optic solution to support the demand for network capacity in the local loop 
we provide optical transport within and between carrier hotels  which are facilities where service providers exchange and route communications traffic  as well as optical transport from carrier hotels to tenants in commercial office buildings 
our networks support multiple transmission protocols including synchronous optical network  or sonet  sdh  ethernet  frame relay  asynchronous transfer mode  or atm and internet protocol  or ip 
we have lit multiple strands of fiber on a redundant and diversely routed sonet ring and ip architecture throughout new york city 
in addition  we also provide services in chicago and los angeles 
we have experienced significant operating losses  net losses and negative cash flows from operating activities 
we expect to continue to experience such losses and negative cash flows as we continue to operate our business 
we also have a limited operating history 
consequently  prospective investors have limited operating history and financial data upon which to evaluate our performance 
the telecommunications industry is currently experiencing a period of uncertainty and rationalization 
many companies in our industry are in financial distress  and some of our largest customers have filed for bankruptcy 
we have been negatively impacted by the general economic environment and by the difficulties that are impacting our industry 
most significantly  customer contracts and services have been cancelled  resulting in a loss of recurring revenues to us 
we are unable to determine the extent to which additional contracts or services that we provide to our customers will be cancelled  and we cannot forecast our ability to replace those cancelled contracts with new contracts 
as a result  our revenues  business operations and liquidity may continue to be negatively affected by the market environment 
factors affecting future operations revenues 
we generate revenues from selling network capacity and related services to other communications service providers 
revenues are derived from three general types of services transport services 
our transport services include the offering of broadband circuits on our metropolitan transport networks and fins 
over our metropolitan transport networks  we can provision circuits from one of our carrier point facilities to another carrier point facility or to an on net building via an interconnection with our fin in that building 
we can also provision circuits vertically between floors in a carrier point facility or an on net building 
in  we also initiated a new type of transport service offering to provide our customers with circuits on networks that we do not own 
we intend to sell this connectivity to our customers and purchase the underlying circuits from other wholesale  telecommunications carriers 
with this new initiative  we believe that we can serve the broader network capacity needs of our customers than we are currently able to on our own networks 
colocation services 
our colocation services include providing customers with the ability to locate their communications and networking equipment at our carrier point facilities in a secure technical operating environment 
we can also provide our customers with colocation services in the central equipment rooms of certain of our on net and off net buildings 
typically  if a customer colocates its equipment at our facilities  our agreement with them may include a minimum commitment to use our transport services 
communications access management services 
our access management services include providing our customers with the non exclusive right to market and provide their retail services to tenants in our on net and off net buildings 
customers typically enter into an agreement with us to gain access to all or a significant number of our properties 
for certain of our on net and off net buildings  we have the exclusive right to manage communications access 
once a customer has entered into an agreement with us for access services  we typically require that customer to utilize our in building networking infrastructure for connectivity to its retail customers  if such networking infrastructure is available 

table of contents our revenues are generated on a monthly recurring basis under contracts with our customers 
these terms of these contracts can range from month to month to fifteen years in length 
during we continued to experience a trend of entering into shorter term contracts with our customers 
previously  our customers typically entered into contracts with terms of three to five years 
increasingly  our customers are electing to purchase services on a month to month basis or for a contracted period of only one year 
our services are typically sold under fixed price agreements 
in the case of transport services  we provide an optical circuit or other means of connectivity for a fixed price 
revenues from transport services are not dependent on customer usage or the distance between the origination point and termination point of a circuit 
the pricing of colocation services is based upon the size of the colocation space or the number of colocation units  such as cabinets  provided to the customer 
revenues from access management services are typically determined by the square footage of the commercial office properties to which a customer purchases access 
the pricing of all of our services have declined significantly over the past year  although we believe not to the extent that the pricing in other segments of the telecommunications market has declined 
the growth of our revenues is dependent upon our ability to provide additional services in our existing facilities 
we also believe that the majority of the growth in our revenues will come from our existing customers 
consequently  our growth in revenues is dependent on the underlying growth of our customers businesses and their need for our services within the facilities that we already operate 
we continue to add additional customers  particularly internationally based carriers 
however  we believe the number of companies that are potential customers is decreasing  due to the industry environment 
in addition  we currently do not anticipate expanding our network infrastructure to other carrier point facilities or on net buildings and off net buildings 
within each of our existing facilities  our revenues will depend upon the demand for our services  the competition that we face and our customer service 
we typically begin our sales cycle by entering into a non binding business services agreement with a customer 
this agreement establishes our mutual interest in exploring a business relationship and the general parameters upon which we will proceed 
as a next step  we execute a telecommunications services agreement  also known as an interconnection agreement 
this is a technical document that outlines the engineering specifications and operating standards that are required of us by the customer 
with the technical requirements complete  we finalize a sales contract 
customers can order a specific circuit or colocation space  or  alternatively  they can purchase general availability on our networks or in our facilities by establishing minimum revenue commitments on a recurring basis 
during the past year  customers have primarily purchased services from us only on an as needed basis  when their networks requirements mandate an immediate need for additional services 
they have not elected to purchase general availability on our networks  nor have they purchased services on a speculative basis 
we have also experienced significant disconnections of services  as customers groom their networks to eliminate excess capacity 
this loss of revenues has had a significantly negative impact on our financial results and may continue 
currently our colocation and access services produce less than one third of our revenues 
in the future we anticipate generating significantly more of our revenues from transport services than from colocation or access management services 
the scalability of our network architecture allows us to increase transport capacity to a greater degree than is possible with our colocation and access services 
cost of services 
cost of services is associated with the operation of our networks and facilities 
the largest component of our cost of services is the occupancy expenses at our carrier point facilities  on net buildings and off net buildings 
other specific costs include maintenance and repair costs and utility costs 
our license agreements for our on net and off net buildings require us to pay license fees to the owners of these properties 
in addition  our leases at hudson street in new york city also require us to pay license fees 
these license fees typically are calculated as a percentage of the revenues that we generate in each particular building 
other than our license fees  our cost of services is generally fixed in nature 
we do not anticipate that cost of services will change commensurately with any change in our revenues 
prospectively  our cost of services will include the costs that we will incur by purchasing connectivity from other wholesale  telecommunications carriers to provide our customers with transport services that are not on our networks 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses generally include all of our personnel costs  occupancy costs for our corporate offices  insurance costs  professional fees  sales and marketing expenses and other miscellaneous expenses 
personnel costs  including wages  benefits and sales 
table of contents commissions  are our largest component of selling  general and administrative expenses 
we have reduced the number of our employees from at the beginning of to as of december   and our personnel costs have decreased significantly 
prospectively  we do not anticipate significant changes in headcount  and we believe that our personnel costs will increase moderately 
other costs included in selling  general and administrative expenses  such as insurance costs  may increase due to changes in the economic environment and telecommunications industry 
stock related expense 
stock related expense relates to the granting of stock options to our employees 
we grant stock options to our employees as a form of equity based compensation to attract  retain and incentivize qualified personnel 
these costs are non cash charges that are amortized over the vesting term of each employee s option agreement 
certain options granted to employees are accounted for using variable plan accounting 
under variable plan accounting  the stock related expense is adjusted for changes in the market price of the underlying common stock 
in december we repriced stock options for certain of our executive officers  resulting in variable plan accounting in accordance with fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  from the date of modification 
the additional intrinsic value was determined on the date of modification using the then market price of the common stock 
the additional compensation cost was recognized over the period from the date of modification to the date the awards vest 
the additional compensation cost has been adjusted in subsequent periods for changes in the market price 
after the awards vested  adjustments to compensation cost for changes in the market price were recognized immediately 
in subsequent periods  the market price declined  resulting in negative compensation cost being recognized 
in accordance with fin  illustration g  income negative expense has been recognized up to the amount of expense previously recognized in prior periods relating specifically to the modified awards 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense includes the depreciation of our network equipment and infrastructure  computer hardware and software  furniture and fixtures  and leasehold improvements  as well as the amortization of certain deferred charges 
we commence the depreciation of network related fixed assets when they are placed into service and depreciate those assets over periods ranging from three to years 
as a result of the impairments of fixed assets that we recorded during and  depreciation and amortization expense may decrease going forward 
significant accounting policies our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results from operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate the estimates that we have made 
these estimates have been based upon historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under difference assumptions or conditions 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  an allowance for doubtful accounts  the impairment of long lived assets including goodwill and the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we recognize revenues when earned as services are provided throughout the life of each contract with a customer 
the majority of our revenues are invoiced on a monthly recurring basis under long term contracts  typically one year in length 
certain of our contracts require us to invoice our customers for the periods ranging from one year to the full term of the contract 
we record deferred revenue for the amount of an invoice that has not been recognized as revenue 
deferred revenue is recorded for the full value of the contract at contract inception  only if we are contractually entitled to invoice the customer for the full value of the contract and the customer had paid such invoice 
we have one reciprocal agreement  whereby we purchase services from one of our customers 
at the beginning of we had four such reciprocal agreements  two were cancelled during and one more was terminated in the beginning of the services provided and obtained through these agreements were priced at fair value as of the date of the agreement 
we recognized the transport and colocation revenues from these 
table of contents agreements in accordance with our stated revenue recognition policy  and we concurrently recorded the expenses for colocation services as cost of services in our statements of operations 
none of the expenses associated with our reciprocal agreements are capitalized 
all of the costs are expensed as incurred 
reciprocal agreements accounted for million  or  of revenues in and million of our cost of services 
in  reciprocal agreements accounted for million  or  of revenues and million of our cost of services 
for the year ended december   reciprocal agreements accounted for million  or  of revenues and million of our cost of services 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain allowances for doubtful accounts based upon our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations  there can be no assurance that we will continue to experience the same level of credit losses that we have in the past 
a significant number of our customers have filed for bankruptcy or are otherwise in significant financial distress 
a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers or a further deterioration in the economic environment or telecommunications industry  in general  could have a material adverse impact on the collectability of our accounts receivable and our future operating results  including a reduction in future revenues and additional allowances for doubtful accounts 
if we determine that collection of a receivable is not reasonably assured  we defer the revenue and recognize it at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of payment 
we assess the fair value and recoverability of our long lived assets  whenever events and circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
in doing so  we make assumptions and estimates regarding future cash flows and other factors to make our determination 
the fair value of our long lived assets is dependent upon the forecasted performance of our business  changes in the telecommunications industry and the overall economic environment 
when we determine that the carrying value of our long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based upon a forecasted discounted cash flow method 
if these forecasts are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
during  we performed an assessment of the goodwill related to our acquisition of devnet  llc  pursuant to sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
devnet had entered into exclusive license agreements to manage communications access to commercial office properties  and we associated the goodwill resulting from the acquisition primarily to those agreements 
we made the determination to perform an assessment based upon significant negative industry and economic trends 
in  a change in the business environment resulted in significantly less demand for telecommunications access to commercial office properties  and the number of potential customers seeking these services diminished greatly 
consequently  we revised our forecasted cash flows from devnet and determined that the decline in the market conditions within this market segment was material and other than temporary 
after using an undiscounted cash flow model of the future cash flows forecasted to be generated from business activities in the commercial office properties underlying the license agreements and determining there was an impairment  we used a discounted cash flow model to determine the size of the impairment 
as a result  we recorded a charge of million during the third quarter of to reduce goodwill associated with the purchase of devnet 
the charge was based on the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded their fair value 
during  we recorded approximately million of amortization of goodwill relating to devnet 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  applicable for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
 which we adopted effective january   requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets resulting from business combinations entered into prior to june  no longer be amortized  but instead be reviewed for recoverability 
any write down of goodwill would be charged as a cumulative change in accounting principle upon adoption of the new accounting standard if the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles exceeds its fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  we considered current information  including an analysis of our market value as a result of our successful recapitalization as discussed in note of the financial statements  and determined that there is no additional impairment of goodwill 
in  we also determined that our forecasts for revenues for certain of our facilities would not be achieved due to the significant adverse change in the business climate 
we further determined that the dramatic change in the operating environment for the telecommunications industry resulted in a significantly less demand for our services in these facilities 
we believe that the decrease in demand was a result of the significant number of bankruptcies of 
table of contents telecommunications companies that were existing or potential customers of ours and the overall economic recession 
we also determined that a rebound in demand for our services would not occur in the near term 
as a result  we revised our business plan and conducted extensive reviews of our assets and operations 
the revisions to the business plan primarily included reductions in forecasts of revenues and capital expenditures 
the projected amounts of certain cost of services and overhead expenses were reduced as well to reflect the decrease in our expected business activity 
we also determined that certain financial covenants in our credit facility would need to reflect the revised business plan  including our reduced revenue forecasts 
consequently  we amended our credit facility in december we used an undiscounted forecasted cash flow model to determine if there was an impairment based on the cash flows expected to be generated from the assets related to these facilities  and used a discounted cash flow model to measure the impairment 
as a result of this analysis  we have recorded an asset impairment of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  based on the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded their fair value 
of this amount  million relates to assets held for use  and million represents assets to be disposed of 
the assets that we identified for disposition were abandoned  as we determined that these assets had no value 
consequently  there was no cost to us for this abandonment  nor do we expect to receive any proceeds or other consideration from this abandonment 
we recorded no reserves  accruals or other liabilities related to this abandonment 
these assets primarily related to engineering and network architecture design costs and general contracting and project management costs for facilities that we are no longer pursuing 
during  we recovered approximately million from the sale of assets previously written off as impaired 
the proceeds were recorded as a recovery of the impairment recorded during the year ended december  during  we recorded a write off of property  plant and equipment of million 
we recorded this write off of capital assets due to the termination of several leases and license agreements for network facilities 
there was no cost to us to abandon these assets  nor do we expect to receive any proceeds or other consideration from the abandonment of these assets 
during  we again determined that our forecasts for revenues at certain facilities would not be achieved due to the ongoing difficulties in the overall business climate and the continued deterioration of the telecommunications industry 
the dramatic change in the operating environment for our industry has resulted in significantly less demand for our services in these facilities  and we also determined that a rebound in demand for our services would not occur in the near term 
in fact we concluded that the prospects for the industry  and our business in particular  were worse than we had forecasted in  because the economy had not rebounded as expected and many significant telecommunications business failures occurred in as a result  we revised our business plan and conducted extensive reviews of our assets and operations 
the revisions to the business plan primarily included further reductions in forecasts of revenues and capital expenditures 
the projected amounts of certain cost of services and overhead expenses were reduced as well to reflect the decrease in our expected business activity 
we again used an undiscounted forecasted cash flow model to determine if there was an impairment based on the cash flows expected to be generated from the assets related to these facilities  and used a discounted cash flow model to measure the impairment 
as a result of this analysis  we have recorded an asset impairment of approximately million in the fourth quarter of  based on the amount by which the carrying amount of these assets exceeded their fair value 
we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon historical losses  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
as a result of this review  we have established a full valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets 

table of contents results of operations fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december revenues 
revenues for the fiscal year ended december  were million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  revenues were generated by providing transport  colocation and communications access management services to our customers 
we recognized million in transport services in  down from million in this decrease was primarily the result of the termination of three of our reciprocal agreements and customer service disconnections 
these negative trends were partially offset by the provisioning of new services for new and existing customers 
revenues from colocation and other services increased to million in from million in  and revenues from communications access management services declined to million in from million in this decrease in access revenues was due to the severe decline in the market for building centric services and the resulting bankruptcies of many building centric service providers  many of whom were our customers 
prospectively  we expect transport services to grow at a faster rate than colocation and access management services 
our network infrastructure has significant capacity to provide additional broadband transport connectivity 
however  our colocation facilities are approaching more stabilized utilization rates 
we do not expect revenue growth in our access management services revenues 
for fiscal year  two customers accounted for approximately of our revenues 
during  three customers accounted for approximately of our revenues 
two of those companies have filed for bankruptcy 
once a customer has filed for bankruptcy  we recognize revenues from that customer only upon the receipt of payment 
prospectively  we expect these customers to represent a significantly lower percentage of our revenues 
reciprocal agreements accounted for million  or  of revenues in  down from million  or  of revenues in in  we terminated two of our reciprocal agreements  and in we terminated one additional reciprocal agreement 
revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the general economic environment and by the difficulties that are impacting our industry 
customer contracts and services have been cancelled  resulting in a loss of recurring revenues to us 
although losses in revenues have been partially offset by customer orders for new services  there can be no assurance that to the extent we continue to incur losses of revenues  they will be offset by orders for new services  if any 
in july we negotiated a revised pricing structure with a significant customer for the services that we provided to it  although we previously were not obligated to do so 
in addition  this customer subsequently terminated certain services that we were providing 
the impact to revenues attributable to these two events was approximately a million reduction in revenues for the year ended december  the impact of these events does not put us in a loss position with respect to the remaining services with this customer 
cost of services 
cost of services  associated with the operation of our networks and facilities  were million in  compared to million in the majority of our cost of services is occupancy expenses  consisting of rent and utility costs  for our carrier hotel facilities  on net buildings and off net buildings 
other cost of services includes license fees  maintenance and repair costs  and professional fees 
the decrease of million was due to a reduction in expenses associated with the elimination of certain of our network facilities and the termination of certain reciprocal agreements 
in addition  cost of services for the year ended december  was reduced by million due to certain  non recurring concessions that we negotiated from vendors  thereby reducing accounts payable 
these items were expensed in prior periods and included in our cost of services 
reciprocal agreements accounted for million of our cost of services in and million of our cost of services for selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million compared to million for the decrease is a result of our aggressive cost savings initiatives to reduce corporate overhead in line with our outlook for business activity 
cost reductions were realized in nearly all components of selling  general and administrative expenses  including advertising and marketing costs  professional fees and travel and entertainment expenses 
the greatest decrease in overhead came in personnel costs  as we reduced headcount from employees at the beginning of to  as of december  included in selling  general and administrative expenses for was a legal settlement expense of approximately million  
table of contents and million of charges incurred for professional fees related to our recapitalization in october we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses to increase modestly in with the general growth of our business  as the significant majority of our cost savings initiatives have already been implemented 
stock related expense 
stock related expense for was million  compared to million for this non cash expense relates to the granting of stock options to employees 
the amount for the prior period reflects a reversal of a previously recorded expense  due to the decline in the price per share of our common stock 
in december  we repriced stock options for certain of our executive officers  resulting in variable plan accounting in accordance with fasb interpretation fin no 
 accounting for certain transactions involving stock compensation  from the date of modification 
the additional intrinsic value was determined on the date of modification using the then market price of the common stock 
the additional compensation cost was recognized over the period from the date of modification to the date the awards vest 
the additional compensation cost has been adjusted in subsequent periods for changes in the market price 
after the awards vested  adjustments to compensation cost for changes in the market price were recognized immediately 
in subsequent periods  the market price declined  resulting in negative compensation cost being recognized 
in accordance with fin  illustration g  income negative expense has been recognized up to the amount of expense previously recognized in prior periods relating specifically to the modified awards 
impairment of property  plant and equipment 
in  we recorded an asset impairment of million to reflect our revised business plan and forecast of revenues due to the continued adverse business environment and industry conditions 
included in this charge is a recovery of million due to the disposition of equipment that was impaired in we also recorded a write off of property  plant and equipment of million in april we recorded this write off of capital assets due to the termination of several property leases and license agreements for network facilities 
there was no cost to us to abandon these assets  nor do we expect to receive any proceeds or other consideration from the abandonment of these assets 
we recorded no other reserves  accruals or other liabilities related to these write offs 
in  we recorded an asset impairment of million to reflect our revised business plan and the state of the market at that time 
impairment of goodwill 
in  we recorded a non cash  non recurring charge for the impairment of goodwill  relating to our acquisition of devnet  llc in the amount of million 
we recorded this write down of goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
no additional impairment of goodwill was recorded in depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for was million  compared to million for this decrease resulted from the impairment of property  plant and equipment that we recorded in and the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  applicable for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
 which we adopted effective january   requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets resulting from business combinations entered into prior to december  no longer be amortized  but instead be reviewed for recoverability

in  we recorded a non cash charge of million related to an early extinguishment of debt from the modification of our credit facility on february  preferred stock dividends 
for the year ended december   we paid approximately  in non cash dividends on our series h preferred stock in the form of additional shares of series h preferred stock  which were convertible into shares of common stock 
in  we paid non cash dividends on our series d  e  f  h and i preferred stock of million in the form of additional shares of each respective series of preferred stock  which were convertible into shares of common stock 
the amounts of the dividends assume the market price per share of the underlying common stock  as of the date the dividends are paid 
the decrease in preferred dividends was the result of a decline in the public market price of our common stock and the conversion of certain series of preferred 
table of contents stock 
the liquidation value of the dividends paid in was million  compared to million for dividends paid in preferred stock beneficial conversion 
in february  the conversion price of our series h and series i preferred stock was reduced to  in accordance with the original terms of the issuance transactions 
the certificates of designation of the series h and series i included provisions requiring the conversion prices to be lowered to the per share price at which we issued any shares of common stock  subject to certain exceptions  subsequent to the initial issuance of the series h and series i 
in february  we issued shares of common stock in a directed public offering at a price of per share  resulting in the reduction of the conversion price 
we recorded a beneficial conversion charge of million as a result of the reduction of the conversion price 
additionally  in connection with the conversion of the series h and series i  the conversion price of the remaining  shares of series h was reduced to 
however  as all of the proceeds from the issuances of the series h and series i had been allocated to beneficial conversion features  no additional proceeds were allocated upon the reset of the conversion price of the series h to 
on december   we consummated a directed public offering of shares of a new series of preferred stock  designated series j preferred stock for an aggregate purchase price of million 
subject to certain adjustments  the series j preferred stock was convertible into the number of shares of common stock equal to of the average of the five lowest volume weighted average prices for our common stock during the trading days immediately prior to the date of conversion  provided that such average price shall not be less than nor greater than 
in connection with this transaction  we recorded a non recurring  non cash charge for a beneficial conversion feature in the amount of million to reflect the market price of the common stock as of the date of the issuance 
the amounts of the beneficial conversion charges assume the market price per share of the underlying common stock  as of the date the charge is incurred  in accordance with eitf issue  accounting for convertible securities with beneficial conversion features or contingently adjustable conversion ratio 
there was no preferred stock beneficial conversion recorded in net loss applicable to common stockholders 
we reported a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million in compared to a loss of million in the decrease in the net loss applicable to common stockholders is a result of the aforementioned changes in our operations 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december revenues 
revenues for the fiscal year ended december  were million as compared to million for the fiscal year ended december  revenues were generated by providing transport  colocation and communications access management services to our customers 
we recognized million in transport services in  up from million in this increase was primarily a result of strong demand for high bandwidth circuits within and between our carrier hotel facilities 
revenues from colocation and other services increased to million in from million in  and revenues from communications access management services grew to million in from million in during  three customers accounted for approximately of our revenues 
in  these customers accounted for of revenues 
two of those companies have filed for bankruptcy

the total proceeds to us from this offering were million  before offering expenses 
in addition  subject to certain conditions  the stock purchase agreement for this offering of series j preferred stock contemplated two additional closings in which we could sell in the aggregate an additional million of series j preferred stock to the initial purchasers

in connection with this amendment  all warrants previously issued under the credit agreement were replaced with new warrants to purchase an equivalent amount of our common stock at a purchase price of per share 
on december  we issued a promissory note in the amount of million to nortel networks inc  a related party  as consideration for accounts payable previously due and owing for equipment and services

on march   we terminated this 
table of contents interest rate swap transaction with deutsche bank ag with no payments or other amounts owed by either party 
as a result  all of our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at a floating rate 
on march   we received gross proceeds of million from the issuance of a subordinated note payable to an existing investor 
the issuance of the note was in lieu of a second and third closing on our series j preferred stock  as was previously contemplated 
the promissory note had an original maturity date of june  and bore interest  which was due and payable on the maturity date  at an annual rate of 
the maturity of this subordinated note payable  as well as the due dates of certain interest payments under our credit facility  were extended as we pursued our recapitalization 
on october  we completed a series of transactions with the lenders under our credit facility as well as certain investors to undertake the recapitalization of our company 
these transactions are described below 
pursuant to the terms of a common stock purchase agreement dated as of october  by and among us and our lenders under our credit facility  we issued  shares of our common stock to the lenders at a price of per share  as prepayment of an aggregate of million of outstanding indebtedness under our credit facility

such shares  together with shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants  also constituted approximately of the shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis  assuming the exercise of all outstanding options and warrants 
in connection with this transaction  we and certain of our lenders also entered into a stockholders agreement dated as of october  under the terms of this stockholders agreement  such lenders have the right to designate two independent persons to be members of our board of directors  along with other certain rights and privileges 
together with the lenders  we also executed a seventh amendment to our credit agreement which  among other things  amends certain terms of the credit agreement in conjunction with the transactions that were consummated on october  as part of the seventh amendment  the term loan commitments and revolving loan commitments available under the credit facility were reduced to a total of million from a total of million 
the term loan commitments were reduced to million  all of which was drawn and outstanding  and the revolving loan commitments were reduced to million 
all of our revolving loan commitments were utilized with drawn  outstanding borrowings of million and outstanding letter of credit issued in the amount of million 
as a result of this amendment  we had no additional availability under our credit facility 
in addition  the effective applicable margin on our borrowings was reduced from libor basis points to libor basis points until december  furthermore  the payment of all accrued interest on borrowings during the period beginning on october  and ending on june  is capitalized and added to the outstanding principal amount of the term loan indebtedness

these warrants are immediately exercisable and contain standard anti dilution protection 
other amendments to our credit facility include modifications to the automatic reduction of commitments and to financial covenants 
previously the first automatic reduction in the availability under our credit facility was to have occurred on june  however as amended  the automatic reduction of commitments begin on a quarterly basis on march  we are also now subject to amended financial covenants 
beginning with the quarter ended september   we must now comply with financial covenants that include minimum consolidated revenue  minimum consolidated ebitda as defined in the credit agreement underlying the credit facility and maximum cumulative capital expenditures 
beginning on december  in addition to those requirements  our financial covenants will also include a maximum consolidated leverage ratio  a minimum consolidated interest coverage ratio and a minimum consolidated fixed charge coverage ratio 
the compliance 
table of contents levels and calculation of such levels with respect to those covenants are as defined in the credit agreement underlying our credit facility  as amended 
pursuant to the terms of an investors rights agreement entered into on october  by and among us and our lenders  we agreed to file a resale registration statement with respect to all of the shares issued to our lenders  including shares issuable upon exercise of the warrants 
this registration statement was declared effective on february  and also included shares issued in the other recapitalization transactions described below 
on october   we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement with certain investors  pursuant to which we issued to the investors in a private offering an aggregate of  shares of common stock for a price of per share  or an aggregate cash consideration of million 
pursuant to the terms of this purchase agreement  we also issued to such investors warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share with a term of five years 
these warrants are also immediately exercisable and contain standard anti dilution protection 
immediately prior to the private offering of common stock and warrants  we consummated certain related transactions with the investors 
in one such transaction  we issued to one of the investors   shares of common stock in exchange for the surrender of a promissory note originally issued on december  by us to a related party  which promissory note had been assigned by such related party to this investor immediately prior to such exchange for  in cash

this transaction was effected pursuant to a series j exchange agreement dated as of october  by and among us and the series j preferred stockholders 
the series j preferred stock so surrendered had an aggregate liquidation preference of million 
we entered into a registration rights agreement dated as of october  with these investors which required us to file a resale registration statement with the securities and exchange commission no later than days after such date  with respect to the registration of all of the shares of common stock issued on october  and all shares issuable upon the exercise of the warrants issued to investors 
as described above  this registration statement was declared effective on february  and included shares issued to our lenders 
in total   shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock were issued on october   as part of these transactions 
on november  in addition to the issuance of common stock and warrants to our lenders in satisfaction of million of accrued interest as discussed above  we issued to an investor  shares of common stock in exchange for the surrender by that investor of the subordinated note payable issued by us on march  in the initial principal amount of million  pursuant to the terms of a note exchange agreement 
such promissory note  at the time of surrender  had outstanding principal and accrued interest of million owing thereon 
furthermore  we also agreed to include such shares issued to our lenders and this investor within the terms of agreements previously entered into on october   including the registration rights agreement 
other than the inclusion of such additional shares  the terms of such amended and restated agreements are unchanged from those of their respective predecessors 
we  together with our lenders  also executed an eighth amendment to the credit agreement dated as of november  to amend certain terms in conjunction with the transactions occurring on such day 
a total of  shares of common stock and warrants to purchase an aggregate of  shares of common stock were issued on november   representing the issuance of approximately of the common 
table of contents stock outstanding  on a fully diluted basis  as of that day 
as a result  we had  shares of common stock outstanding  or approximately  shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis  assuming the exercise of all outstanding options and warrants 
in connection with the transactions consummated on october  and november   we paid a fee of million to a financial advisory firm and issued to that firm warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share with a term of one year 
in addition  michael liss  our chief executive officer  was compensated in the amount of million for his efforts in negotiating and completing the transactions described above 
on january   we completed another series of transactions with the lenders under our credit facility 
pursuant to the terms of three debt exchange agreements between us and each of bank one  na  nortel networks inc and td securities usa inc  we issued  shares of our common stock to these lenders at a price of per share  in satisfaction of approximately million of indebtedness  representing all of the outstanding principal indebtedness and accrued interest owing to these lenders under our credit facility 
we also entered into a common stock purchase agreement  dated as of january   with certain investors  pursuant to which we issued to the investors in a private offering an aggregate of  shares of common stock for a price of per share  for an aggregate cash consideration of million 
pursuant to the terms of the purchase agreement  we also issued to such investors warrants to purchase an additional  shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share with a term of five years 
concurrently with the other transactions occurring on january   the investors also purchased  shares of common stock from the three lenders  departing from the credit facility  in a privately negotiated transaction for an aggregate cash consideration of million 
in connection with the purchase agreement with the investors  we entered into a registration rights agreement  dated as of january   with the investors which required us to file a resale registration statement with the securities and exchange commission with respect to the registration of all of the shares of common stock issued under the purchase agreement and the shares that the investors purchased from the departing lenders 
these shares were also included in the registration statement that was declared effective on february  in connection with the transactions contemplated by the debt exchange agreements  we executed a ninth amendment to our credit agreement  pursuant to which  among other things  the rights and obligations of the departing lenders under the credit facility terminated  subject to standard reinstatement and survival provisions 
as a condition to the lenders entering into this amendment  we agreed to reduce the exercise price of certain warrants previously issued to and held by the lenders to purchase approximately  shares of common stock from per share to per share 
all of the repriced warrants were immediately exercised by the lenders 
in addition pursuant to a security agreement and a securities account control agreement  we agreed to deposit approximately million in a restricted account as cash collateral to secure the assumption by deutsche bank ag new york branch of the departing lenders funding obligations for our outstanding letters of credit  which totalled approximately million 
as a result of these transactions  we had million of indebtedness outstanding under our credit facility  which reflects the total amount available under the credit facility as of january  the weighted average interest rate on our outstanding borrowings under the facility were  and we were in full compliance with all of the covenants contained in the credit agreement underlying the facility 
non compliance with any of the covenants  requirements  or other terms and conditions under the credit agreement  constitutes an event of default and potentially accelerates the outstanding balance of the credit facility for immediate payment 
in addition  we have approximately billion shares of common stock outstanding  or approximately billion shares of common stock outstanding on a fully diluted basis  assuming the exercise of all outstanding options and warrants 
currently  the three remaining lenders under the company s senior secured credit facility own approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
we anticipate spending approximately million in capital expenditures during  primarily for the implementation of customer orders 
we have substantially completed the deployment of our fins  carrier hotel facilities and metropolitan transport networks 
we may expend additional capital for the selected expansion of our network infrastructure  depending upon market conditions  customer demand and our liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents our obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts primarily include scheduled reductions in the availability of our credit facility  principal payments on our capital lease obligations  and payments under our operating leases 
the chart below identifies our outstanding contractual obligations and commitments as of december  payments due by period in thousands contractual obligation total thereafter mandatory repayments and reductions of indebtedness inclusive of capitalized interest capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual obligations we believe that the completion of the transactions that constituted our recapitalization significantly enhanced our liquidity and improved our financial position 
under our current operating plan  we do not anticipate requiring any external sources of capital to fund our operations in the coming year 
however if actual results vary from the anticipated results of our operating plan  we may not be able to fund our operating and investing activities with internally generated cash flows  and we may require external sources of capital 
from time to time  we may consider private or public sales of additional equity or debt securities and other financings  depending upon market conditions  in order to finance the continued operations of our business 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully consummate any such financing on acceptable terms  or at all 
we do not have any off balance sheet financing arrangements  nor do we anticipate entering into any 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  applicable for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
 which we adopted effective january   requires that goodwill and certain intangible assets resulting from business combinations entered into prior to june  no longer be amortized  but instead be reviewed for recoverability 
any write down of goodwill would be charged as a cumulative change in accounting principle upon adoption of the new accounting standard if the recorded value of goodwill and certain intangibles exceeds its fair value 
during the fourth quarter of  we considered current information  including an analysis of our market value as a result of our successful recapitalization as discussed in note of the financial statements  and determined that there is no additional impairment of goodwill 
the following table presents the impact of sfas no 
as if it had been in effect for the years ended december  and in thousands  except per share amounts year ended december  net loss applicable to common stockholders plus goodwill amortization adjusted net loss applicable to common stockholders basic and diluted earnings per share net loss applicable to common stockholders plus goodwill amortization adjusted net loss applicable to common stockholders in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
the statement requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity capitalizes a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its then present value  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
upon settlement of the liability  an entity either settles the obligation for its recorded amount or incurs a gain or loss upon settlement 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june   with earlier application encouraged 
we do not expect the adoption of the statement to have a material impact on our results of operations 

table of contents in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the statement replaces sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  although it retains the impairment testing methodology used in sfas no 
the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  are superceded by sfas no 
 except that the statement preserves the requirement of apb opinion no 
to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations 
the statement covers a variety of implementation issues inherent in sfas no 
 unifies the framework used in accounting for assets to be disposed of and discontinued operations  and broadens the reporting of discontinued operations to include all components of an entity with operations that can be distinguished from the rest of the entity and that will be eliminated from the ongoing operations of the entity in a disposal transaction 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted sfas no 
on january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements  and  amendment of fasb statement  and technical corrections 
sfas no 
rescinds the provisions of sfas no 
that requires companies to classify certain gains and losses from debt extinguishments as extraordinary items  eliminates the provisions of sfas no 
regarding transition to the motor carrier act of and amends the provisions of sfas no 
to require that certain lease modifications be treated as sale leaseback transactions 
the provisions of sfas no 
related to classification of debt extinguishment are effective for fiscal years beginning after may  commencing january   we will classify debt extinguishment costs within income from operations and will reclassify previously reported debt extinguishments as such 
the provisions of sfas no 
related to lease modification are effective for transactions occurring after may  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no

 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in as restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas no 
and eitf no 
relates to its requirements for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf no 
 a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
is effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the provisions of sfas no 
to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of statement no

elaborates on the disclosures to be made by the guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we believe this statement will not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
certain facts that may affect future results of operations this report contains certain forward looking statements as that term is defined in the private securities litigation reform act of such statements are based on management s current expectations and are subject to a number of factors and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward looking statements 
investors are cautioned that there can be no assurance that actual results or business conditions will not differ materially from those projected or suggested in such forward looking statements as a result of various factors  including  but not limited to  those discussed below 
as a result  our future operations involve a high degree of risk 
except as required by law  we undertake no obligation to update any forward looking statement  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors affecting our business condition in addition to the other information and factors included in this report  the following factors should be considered in evaluating our business and future prospects 
table of contents we are an early stage company  and we expect to encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
we did not begin to engage in our current business until and did not begin to offer our services until the first quarter of the market for our services is unproven  and our limited operating history makes the evaluation of our future prospects very difficult 
we will encounter risks and difficulties frequently experienced by early stage companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
as an early stage organization we are at a competitive disadvantage to larger  more established competitors 
we anticipate that this competitive disadvantage may persist for the foreseeable future 
if we do not successfully address these risks  our business may suffer 
we have and may continue to experience operating losses  net losses and a cash flow deficit 
we may not achieve or sustain operating income  net income or positive cash flow from operations in the future 
since our inception we have incurred operating losses and net losses both on an annual and quarterly basis 
we have not achieved profitability and expect to continue to incur operating losses and net losses in  and we may not for the foreseeable future 
in  we had an operating loss of million and a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million  and in  we had an operating loss of million and a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million 
in  we had an operating loss of million and a net loss applicable to common stockholders of million 
in  we had revenues of million  and in we had revenues of million 
in  we generated revenues of million 
you should also be aware that our financial and operational performance depends upon a number of factors  many of which are beyond our control 
these factors include the economic and competitive conditions in the communications and networking industries  any operating difficulties  increased operating costs or pricing pressures we may experience  the passage of legislation or other regulatory developments that may adversely affect us  changes in technologies creating alternative services to our services or making our services and networks obsolete  any delays in implementing any strategic projects  and our ability to operate our networks in a reliable and cost effective manner 
we may require additional capital to fund the further development of our networks and operation of our business  and an inability to obtain such capital could harm our business 
although we have substantially completed the build out of our networks  we may selectively expand our networks in the future as market conditions and customer demand dictate 
in addition  we may have to expand or adapt our networks to respond to the following an increasing number of customers  demand for greater capacity  the replacement of inadequate or malfunctioning network elements  changes in our customers service requirements  and technological advances to do so  we may need to raise additional funds through public or private equity or debt financings 
if we raise funds through the issuance of equity securities  the ownership percentage of our then current stockholders will be diluted and the holders of new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
if additional funds are raised through another bank credit facility or the issuance of debt 
table of contents securities  the holders of such indebtedness would have rights senior to the rights of the holders of our common stock  and the terms of this indebtedness could impose restrictions on our ability to incur additional indebtedness and on our operations  which could impede the successful completion of our business plan 
there can be no assurance that additional funds will be available at the time needed  or on terms acceptable to us 
our inability to obtain additional financing  as needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we must maintain our existing agreements for space in major carrier hotels or our business will be harmed 
our business depends upon our ability to lease space in carrier hotels to establish carrier point facilities where we can locate our networking equipment and interconnect with our customers 
at a minimum  to provide our services in a particular metropolitan area  we must obtain space in the major carrier hotels in that area 
in addition  we need adequate space at our carrier point facilities in order to continue offering colocation services 
there may be significant competition for space in major carrier hotels 
our inability to obtain additional space  or our inability to renew existing leases  would negatively impact our operations and have a material adverse effect on our business 
many of our customers and vendors are experiencing financial difficulties and have filed or may file for bankruptcy protection 
the recent general economic weakness has severely impacted the telecommunications industry 
the expected demand for broadband connectivity has not been realized in many segments of the market 
as a result  there has been an industry wide slowdown in capital spending and a large number of industry related bankruptcy filings 
many of our customers and vendors are currently experiencing financial distress  some of them have filed for bankruptcy protection 
we have contracts with communications providers that have filed for relief from creditors under the bankruptcy code  as well as contracts with other communications providers who may still yet file for bankruptcy protection 
as a result  there is a significant doubt that some of our customers or vendors will perform their obligations under our contracts with them 
in bankruptcy proceedings  the debtor  or trustee  as the case may be  has the right to  among other things  reject certain contracts 
in the past  bankruptcy courts have determined that certain our contracts with our customers constitute executory contracts  and the contracts were rejected 
as a result  we received an unsecured claim for damages against the debtors  and all rights and privileges under the contracts were terminated  including payment for services rendered 
there can be no assurance that additional customers or vendors will not seek bankruptcy protection and that additional contracts will be terminated 
we should increase the number of our significant customers and the volume of traffic on our networks or our business may suffer 
our revenues continue to be negatively impacted by the general economic environment and by the difficulties that are affecting our industry 
as a result  we should increase the current volume of traffic on our networks in order to realize anticipated revenues and cash flows 
to do so  we must obtain long term commitments from new large volume customers  as well as expand our relationships with current customers 
this need is more critical as a wholesale carrier because our potential customers are a limited number of service providers 
therefore  it is essential for us to succeed at establishing and expanding customer relationships  otherwise our business will suffer 
during the fiscal year ended december   two of our largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenues 
this concentration of revenues increases the risk of a substantial decrease in our revenues  resulting from a deterioration in our relationship with either of these customers 
if we cannot maintain the scalability  reliability and speed of our network  potential customers will not use our services 
because of the limited deployment of our services  our ability to manage a substantial amount of traffic on our networks while maintaining superior service is unknown at this time 
there is no assurance that our network will be able to maintain current levels of service as the number of our customers grows 
our failure to maintain such levels 
table of contents of service would significantly reduce customer demand for our services and have a material adverse effect on our business 
service interruptions on our networks could expose us to liability or cause us to lose customers 
our operations depend on our ability to avoid and mitigate any damages from power losses  network failures  transmission cable cuts or natural disasters 
the failure of any equipment or facility on our networks could result in the interruption of service until we make the necessary repairs or install replacement equipment 
if service is not restored in a timely manner  agreements with our customers may obligate us to provide credits or other remedies to them  which would reduce our revenues 
service disruptions could also damage our reputation with customers  causing us to lose existing customers or have difficulty attracting new ones 
many of our customers communications needs are extremely time sensitive  and delays in signal delivery may cause significant losses to a customer using our networks 
our networks may also contain undetected design faults and software bugs that  despite our testing  may be discovered only after our networks have been completed and are in use 
the occurrence of a natural disaster or act of terrorism in close proximity to our facilities would substantially harm our business 
the substantial majority of our facilities are located within the new york metropolitan area  with the remainder located in chicago and los angeles 
given the concentration of our facilities  the loss of one of our facilities through the occurrence of a natural disaster  fire or flood  or an act of terrorism would have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we may not carry sufficient insurance to compensate us for losses caused by such an occurrence 
our failure to manage the growth of our operations could harm our business 
we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations 
we anticipate that further expansion will be required to grow our customer base if we are to be successful in implementing our business strategy 
our future performance depends in part upon our senior management s ability to manage our growth effectively 
we may not be able to implement management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  our business will suffer 
our business will be harmed if our information support systems are not further developed 
sophisticated information processing systems  including provisioning  accounting and network management  are vital to our growth and our ability to achieve operating efficiencies 
our plans for the development and implementation of these systems rely largely upon acquiring products and services from third party vendors and integrating those products and services 
we may be unable to implement these systems on a timely basis or at all  and these systems may not perform as expected 
a failure of these systems could substantially impair our ability to provide services  send invoices and monitor our operations 
we may also be unable to maintain and upgrade our operational support systems as necessary 
we license key software from third parties 
if we are unable to obtain such software on commercially acceptable terms  our business could be adversely affected 
we rely on software licensed from third parties  including applications that are integrated with internally developed software and used in our services 
most notably  we license portal  preside and metasolv tbs 
these third party technology licenses may not continue to be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  or at all  and we may not be able to obtain licenses for other existing or future technologies that we desire to integrate into our services 
although we believe that there are alternative suppliers for the software that we rely upon  it could take a significant period of time to establish relationships with alternative suppliers and integrate their software into our services 
the loss of any of our relationships with these suppliers could have a material adverse affect on our business 

table of contents we depend on our key personnel  and the loss of their services may adversely affect our business 
we are highly dependent upon the efforts of our senior management team  none of whom currently have an employment agreement with us 
the death or departure of any of our key personnel could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may become the subject of litigation by our stockholders  which could adversely affect our business 
in addition to claims that may arise in the normal course of our business and financing activities  certain of our stockholders may sue us in an attempt to recover their losses as a result of the decline in our stock price 
the resolution of such a claim would likely be costly and time consuming 
if any or all of such claims cannot be resolved through a negotiated settlement  we could become a party to the resulting litigation 
any litigation  even if we are successful  could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and management attention 
an adverse determination in any litigation could also subject us to significant liability  under the judgment of a court or by default 
the sector in which we operate is highly competitive  and we may not be able to compete effectively 
we face competition from many entities with significantly greater financial resources  well established brand names and larger customer bases 
the entities that compete with us include cable modem  internet  digital subscriber line  microwave  mobile and fixed wireless service providers  local telephone companies  long distance companies and competitive collocation providers 
the numerous companies that may seek to enter our market may expose us to severe price competition for our services 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
if these competitors successfully focus on our market opportunity  there may be intense price competition which could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may face competition from various service providers in buildings for which we have exclusive license agreements 
we generally have exclusive license agreements for both our on net and off net buildings 
even though our competitors cannot install a central distribution system in any of our buildings covered by an exclusive agreement  they may still compete with us by installing infrastructure designed to directly service one or more specific tenants in the building as requested by such tenants 
consequently  they could indirectly compete against us by not utilizing our in building networks to gain connectivity to tenants 
in addition  incumbent local exchange carriers  or ilecs  and the regional bell operating companies  or rbocs  currently own pre existing  copper based networks in many of our on net and off net buildings 
these ilecs and rbocs may be able to upgrade their existing networks to provide advanced broadband services which would place them in direct competition with us 
furthermore  service providers may have pre existing license agreements in our buildings  which allow these providers to install  and possibly expand  their network infrastructure in our buildings 
as a result  we may face competition in some of the buildings for which we have exclusive license agreements 
alternative technologies pose competitive threats 
in addition to fiber optic technology  there are other technologies that provide more capacity and speed than traditional copper wire transmission technology  such as digital subscriber lines  or dsl  and wireless technologies  and can be used instead of our network 
furthermore  these technologies may be improved and other new technologies may be developed that provide more capacity  reliability  scalability and speed than the fiber optic technology we deploy 
the development of new technologies or the significant penetration of alternative technologies into our target markets may reduce the demand for our services and consequently could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in the communications industry  continued pricing pressure from our competitors and an excess of network capacity continue to cause prices for our services to decline 
we anticipate that prices for broadband network services  in general  and for our services  in particular  will continue to decline over the next several years due primarily to the following price competition as various service providers continue to install networks that might compete with our networks  
table of contents recent technological advances that permit substantial increases in the transmission capacity of both new and existing fiber  and strategic alliances or similar transactions that increase customers purchasing power 
we have outstanding debt that may limit our ability to borrow additional money  restrict the use of our cash flows and constrain our business strategy  and we may not be able to meet our debt obligations 
as of february   we had total debt of million 
as a result of this debt and debt that we may incur in the future  we will need to devote a portion of our available cash towards debt service payments 
in addition  our ability to borrow additional money is restricted by our current debt arrangements 
furthermore  we have agreed to terms in the credit agreement  which governs our senior secured credit facility  that expose us to certain risks and limitations  including the following as the interest rate on our debt is variable  if interest rates rise  our debt service payments will increase  we have made affirmative financial covenants that we will breach if our financial results do not meet our expectations  and we have agreed to certain negative covenants that may cause us to make choices regarding the operation of our business that we would not otherwise make 
you should be aware that our ability to repay or refinance our debt depends on our successful financial and operating performance and on our ability to implement our business strategy successfully 
we cannot assure you that our future cash flows and capital resources will be sufficient to repay our existing indebtedness and any indebtedness we may incur in the future  or that we will be successful in obtaining alternative financing 
further  our borrowings under our credit facility are secured by substantially all of our assets and our obligations under our facility are guaranteed by our subsidiaries 
in the event that we are unable to repay our debts  we may be forced to reduce or delay the completion or expansion of our networks  sell some of our assets  obtain additional equity capital or refinance or restructure our debt 
if we are unable to meet our debt service obligations or comply with our covenants  we would be in default under our existing debt agreements 
to avoid a default  we may need waivers from third parties  which might not be granted 
legislation and government regulation could adversely affect us 
we are subject to federal  state and local regulations that affect our services  competition  the taxation of our services and other aspects of our operations 
the regulation of the communications industry is changing rapidly  and varies from state to state 
changes in the regulatory environment could affect our operating results by increasing competition  decreasing revenue  increasing costs or impairing our ability to offer services 
certain communications services are subject to significant regulation at the federal and state level 
the federal communications commission  or fcc  regulates communications carriers providing intrastate  interstate and international common carrier services 
state public utility commissions exercise jurisdiction over intrastate communications services 
the fcc and state public utility commissions do not regulate most enhanced services  which involve more than the pure transmission of customer provided information 
our subsidiary  local fiber  llc  is regulated as a common carrier by virtue of its provision of communications services directly to the public for a fee 
as a common carrier  local fiber  llc is subject to extensive federal  state and local communications regulation  which includes the payment of all applicable regulatory assessments 
many of our competitors and vendors  especially ilecs  are subject to federal and state regulations 
these regulations change from time to time in ways that are difficult for us to predict 
although we believe the services we provide today  other than those provided by local fiber  llc  are not subject to regulation imposed on other telecommunications services by the fcc or the state public utility commissions  changes in regulation or new legislation may impose regulation on our non regulated services 
regulation of access to office buildings could negatively affect our business 
some states have adopted laws that require that commercial building owners provide non discriminatory access to communications providers 
recently  
table of contents the fcc released its decision relating to access to commercial multiple tenant buildings  and legislation was enacted that increases telecommunications access to buildings owned or used by the federal government 
among other decisions  the fcc prohibited telecommunications carriers from entering into exclusive agreements with commercial building owners on a prospective basis  and required utilities  including local exchange carriers  to provide access to other telecommunications carriers and cable service providers 
other building access issues remain to be addressed by the fcc 
depending on how these rules are interpreted  these requirements may facilitate our competitors entry into buildings in which we offer our services  which in turn will diminish the value of our access rights and adversely affect our competitive position 
as an access provider  we may incur liability for information disseminated through our networks 
the law relating to the liability of access providers and on line services companies for information carried on or disseminated through their networks is unsettled 
although we have not been sued for information carried on our networks  it is possible that we could be 
federal and state statutes have been directed at imposing liability on internet service providers for aspects of content carried on their networks 
there may be new legislation and court decisions that may affect our services and expose us to potential liability 
as the law in this area develops  the potential imposition of liability for information carried on and disseminated through our networks could require us to implement measures to reduce our exposure to such liability  which may require the expenditure of substantial resources or the discontinuation of certain products or services offerings 
any significant costs that we incur as a result of such measures or the imposition of liability could have a material adverse effect on our business  including our operating expenses and our liquidity 
our principal stockholders  directors and executive officers currently control a majority of the voting rights of our stock  and this may limit your ability to affect the outcome of any stockholder vote or exercise any influence over our business 
the concentration of ownership of our common stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control  merger  consolidation  or tender offer that could involve a premium over the price of our common stock 
currently  our executive officers  directors and greater than five percent stockholders and their affiliates  in the aggregate  beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders  if they vote together  are able to exercise significant influence over all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions and matters 
anti takeover provisions could prevent or delay a change of control that stockholders may consider favorable 
provisions in our certificate of incorporation  our by laws and delaware law could delay or prevent a change of control or change in management that would provide stockholders with a premium to the market price of their common stock 
the authorization of undesignated preferred stock  for example  gives our board the ability to issue preferred stock with voting or other rights or preferences that could impede the success of any attempt to change control of the company 
if a change of control or change in management is delayed or prevented  this premium may not be realized  or the market price of our common stock could decline 
the liquidity of our common stock could be adversely affected by changes in our nasdaq listing 
our common stock is currently listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
on february   we received notification from nasdaq that our common stock failed to comply with nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement of per share for continued listing on the nasdaq national market 
pursuant to the notification from nasdaq  our common stock was to be delisted from the nasdaq national market on may  we  however  successfully applied to nasdaq to have our listing transferred from the nasdaq national market to the nasdaq smallcap market 
our common stock began trading on the nasdaq smallcap market on may  we then had until august   to regain compliance with nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement 
although we did not satisfy the minimum bid price requirement by august   nasdaq granted us an additional calendar day grace period to regain compliance with its minimum bid price requirement 
on march   we received notification from nasdaq that we were granted another grace period until may  to regain compliance 
we have yet to satisfy this requirement  and we may be delisted from the nasdaq 
table of contents smallcap market  upon notification 
our stockholders have approved our effectuating a reverse stock split to bring us into compliance with nasdaq s minimum bid price requirement  however  our board of directors has yet to adopt such a reverse stock split 
if we are delisted from the nasdaq smallcap market  our shares will continue to trade  if at all  on the otc bulletin board  upon application by the requisite market makers 
this will adversely impact our stock price  as well as the liquidity of the market for our shares which  as a result  will adversely affect the ability of our stockholders to purchase and sell their shares in an orderly manner  or at all 
furthermore  a delisting of our shares could damage our general business reputation and impair our ability to raise additional funds 
any of the foregoing events could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
effect of reverse split we have received the approval of our stockholders to effect either a for or a for reverse stock split at any time prior to june  should we determine to effectuate either of the reverse splits  the number of shares of our common stock outstanding will be reduced proportionately and the value of our common stock could be negatively affected in a number of ways  including less liquidity by virtue of fewer shares being traded and that although initially the market price per share of our common stock will be increased proportionately with the reverse split  there is no guarantee that the common stock will maintain such increased market price 
additionally  if after the reverse split is effectuated a stockholder owns less than shares of our common stock  then such stockholder will be considered an odd lot holder and sales by such holders usually involve higher transaction costs 
holders of our common stock will not receive a return on their shares until they sell them because we do not plan to pay cash dividends on our shares 
we have neither declared nor paid any dividends on our common stock and do not anticipate paying cash dividends in the future 
we currently intend to retain any earnings to fund operations and future growth 
furthermore  our credit facility currently prohibits  and the terms of any future debt agreements or preferred stock will likely restrict  the payment of cash dividends on our common stock 
our stock price is likely to be highly volatile  and you may lose all or part of your investment 
the trading price of our common stock is highly volatile 
failure to meet market expectations because of quarterly fluctuations in our financial results could cause our stock price to decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment 
moreover  factors that are not related to our operating performance could cause our stock price to decline 
the stock market has periodically experienced significant price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices for securities of technology and communications companies 
consequently  you may experience a decrease in the market value of your common stock or lose all or part of your investment  regardless of our operating performance or prospects 
we must issue a substantial number of additional shares of common stock  which could adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
we have a substantial number of shares of common stock subject to stock options and warrants 
we cannot predict the effect  if any  that future sales of shares of common stock  or the availability of shares of common stock for future sale  will have on the market price of our common stock 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock including shares issued upon the exercise of stock options or warrants  or the perception that such sales could occur  may adversely affect prevailing market prices for our common stock

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to financial market risk  including changes in interest rates  relates primarily to our credit facility and marketable security investments 
borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at floating rates  based upon libor or a base rate plus an applicable margin 
as a result  we are subject to fluctuations in interest rates 
a basis point increase in libor would increase our annual interest expense by less than million per year 
as of february   we had borrowed million under our credit facility  with a current weighted average interest rate of 

table of contents on january  we entered into an interest rate swap transaction with deutsche bank ag for a notional amount of million and a term of two years 
pursuant to this transaction  we were obligated to make quarterly interest payments at a fixed  annual interest rate of

as part of this agreement  deutsche bank ag was obligated to pay to us on a quarterly basis a floating rate of interest based upon libor with a designated maturity of three months 
on march   we terminated this interest rate swap transaction with deutsche bank ag with no payments or other amounts owed by either party 
as a result  all of our outstanding borrowings under our credit facility bear interest at a floating rate 
we generally place our marketable security investments in high credit quality instruments  primarily us government obligations and corporate obligations with contractual maturities of less than one year
