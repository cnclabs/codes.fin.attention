factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include those set forth in the following discussion  and  in particular  the risks discussed below under the subheading factors that may affect operating results and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission 
unless required by law we undertake no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements 
we are a leading enabler of real time business 
we are the successor to a portion of the business of teknekron software systems  inc teknekron developed software  known as the tib technology  for the integration and delivery of market data  such as stock quotes  news and other financial information  in trading rooms of large banks and financial services institutions 
in  teknekron expanded its development efforts to include solutions designed to enable complex and disparate manufacturing equipment and software applications primarily in the semiconductor fabrication market to communicate within the factory environment 
teknekron was acquired by reuters group plc  the global news and information group  in following the acquisition  continued development of the tib technology was undertaken to expand its use in the financial services markets 
in january  our company  tibco software inc  was established as an entity separate from teknekron 
we were formed to create and market software solutions for use in the integration of business information  processes and applications in diverse markets and industries outside the financial services sector 
in connection with our establishment as a separate entity  reuters transferred to us certain assets and liabilities related to our business and granted to us a royalty free license to the intellectual property from which some of our messaging software products originated 
reuters also assigned to us at that time license and service contracts primarily within the high tech manufacturing and energy markets  including contracts with nec  motorola  mobil and chevron 
during fiscal  we continued to focus on strengthening our position in our significant vertical markets and our relationships with major system integrators such as kpmg  cap gemini ernst young and deloitte touche 
we also introduced our tibco activeexchange product suite  which is used to more dynamically and collaboratively automate interactions among businesses 
in addition  we added more than new customers during fiscal  including such industry leaders as agilent  el paso energy  schering plough and the limited 
during fiscal  we released new products including tibco activeexchange  the business to business solution that expanded our support for xml standards and electronic data integration edi  and consolidated our leadership position in supporting rosettanet standards 
in addition  we announced an initiative to make business integration more widely accessible with the anticipated release of tibco businessworks  a comprehensive  packaged  easy to use platform that gives companies the ability to rapidly solve integration challenges 
tibco businessworks is also one of the first solution to enable comprehensive  cross platform web services for new and legacy systems  including internal application and business process integration  as well as real time monitoring and management 
during fiscal  we released two new products i tibco businessworks  and ii tibco businessfactor  and made significant improvements to our messaging offering adding two new messaging products 
we also continued to develop and enhance our existing products  which are marketed and sold as part of our three product families tibco activeenterprise for eai and bpm  tibco activeexchange for bb integration  and tibco activeportal for web based user integration 

table of contents our products are currently licensed by approximately  companies worldwide in diverse industries such as telecommunications  retail  healthcare  manufacturing  energy  transportation  logistics  financial services  government and insurance 
we sell our products through a direct sales force and through alliances with leading software vendors and systems integrators 
our revenue in fiscal  and consisted primarily of license and maintenance fees from our customers and distributors  including fees from reuters pursuant to our license agreement  both of which were primarily attributable to sales of our tibco activeenterprise product suite 
in addition  we receive fees from our customers for providing project integration services 
we also receive revenue from our strategic relationships with business partners who embed our products in their hardware and networking systems as well as from systems integrators who resell our products 
we recognize license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
when contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by statement of position revenue from subscription license agreements  which include software  rights to future products and maintenance  is recognized ratably over the term of the subscription period 
revenue on shipments to resellers  which is generally subject to certain rights of return and price protection  is recognized when the products are sold by the resellers to the end user customer 
first year maintenance typically is sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
maintenance revenue is deferred based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value and amortized over the term of the maintenance contract  typically months 
consulting and training revenues are recognized as the services are performed and are usually on a time and materials basis 
such services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation of the company s products and generally do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
reuters is a distributor of our products to customers in the financial services segment 
reuters owns approximately of our outstanding capital stock and nominated two members on our board of directors 
we have a license  maintenance and distribution agreement with reuters pursuant to which reuters pays a minimum guaranteed distribution fee to us in the amount of million per year through december for the calendar years ended december   and  reuters guaranteed minimum distribution fees were million  million and million  respectively 
these fees are recognized ratably over the corresponding period as related party revenue 
if actual distribution fees due from reuters exceed the cumulative minimum year to date guarantee  incremental fees are due 
such incremental fees are recognized in the period when the year to date fees exceed the cumulative minimum level 
royalty payments to reuters for resale of reuters products and services or fees associated with sales to the financial services segment are classified as related party cost of revenue 
in addition  our agreement with reuters also requires us to provide reuters with internal maintenance and support until december  for a fee of million per year plus an annual cpi based increase  subject to reuters annual renewal option 
this amount is recognized ratably over the corresponding period as related party service and maintenance revenue 
reuters obligation to pay us minimum guaranteed product fees expires at the end of the potential effects of this expiration on our revenues from the financial services market are unclear  and we may desire to renegotiate the terms of our licensing and distribution relationship with reuters 
any new agreement with reuters would be the result of negotiations between reuters and us  and  because of reuters relationship with us and its influence over our business  would be approved by a majority of our board of directors  including a majority of our independent and disinterested directors 
under our agreement with reuters  through may   we are restricted  unless we receive approval from reuters  from selling our products and providing consulting services directly to companies in the financial services market 
we are also restricted from selling the tib technology we license from reuters directly to 
table of contents companies in the financial services market or major competitors of reuters  or from using the tib technology to develop products specifically for use by these companies 
accordingly  through may   we must rely on reuters and  to a lesser extent  other third party resellers and distributors to sell our products to these companies 
further  reuters is required to pay us product fees based on a percentage of its revenue from sales of our products in the financial services market  excluding products that are embedded in any reuters products 
these product fees may be materially less than the product fees we could obtain from other distributors or resellers in the financial services market 
in addition  when we sell our products into the financial services market other than through reuters  we are required to pay fees to reuters  which we record as related party cost of revenue 
our revenue is derived from a diverse customer base and no single customer represented greater than of total revenue during fiscal  and  respectively 
one customer had a balance in excess of of net accounts receivable at november  there were no customers with a balance in excess of of net accounts receivable at november  we establish allowances for doubtful accounts based on our evaluation of collectibility and an allowance for returns and discounts based on specifically identified credits and historical experience 
since the first quarter of fiscal  adverse general economic conditions and conditions in the enterprise software industry have impacted the ability of our customers to purchase our products and services as uncertainty in their businesses had increased 
these conditions have caused our sales cycle to lengthen  customer budgets for research and development to decrease and customer purchases to be delayed or decreased 
we expect these conditions in the general economy and in our industry to continue to adversely impact our customers ability to purchase our products and services in the near future  but we are unable to predict with certainty how long these trends will persist 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the annual consolidated financial statements as of and for the year ended november  we believe our most critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically allowance for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts and accrued restructuring costs  accounting for income taxes  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  and accounting for investments 
revenue recognition 
we recognize license revenue when a signed contract or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
when contracts contain multiple elements wherein vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by statement of position revenue from subscription license agreements  which include software  rights to future products and maintenance  is recognized 
table of contents ratably over the term of the subscription period 
revenue on shipments to resellers  when subject to certain rights of return and price protection  is recognized when the products are sold by the resellers to the end user customer 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable and collection is probable at the time of the transaction 
in determining whether the fee is fixed or determinable we compare the payment terms of the transaction to our normal payment terms 
if a significant portion of a fee is due after our normal payment terms  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable and recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess whether collection is probable based on a number of factors  including the customer s past transaction history and credit worthiness 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not probable  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes probable  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
first year maintenance typically is sold with the related software license and renewed on an annual basis thereafter 
for such arrangements with multiple obligations  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values of ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based on separate sales of renewals to other customers or upon renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance and support period 
fair value of services  such as consulting or training  is based upon separate sales of these services 
consulting and training services are generally billed based on hourly rates and revenues are generally recognized as the services are performed 
consulting services primarily consist of implementation services related to the installation of our products and generally do not include significant customization to or development of the underlying software code 
significant management judgments and estimates must be made in connection with determination of the revenue to be recognized in any accounting period 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue recognized could result 
valuation allowances and accrued liabilities allowance for doubtful accounts and returns and discounts 
we establish allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts based on our review of credit profiles of our customers  contractual terms and conditions  current economic trends and historical payment  and return and discount experience 
we reassess the allowances for doubtful accounts  returns and discounts each period 
if we made different judgments or utilized different estimates for any period  material differences in the amount and timing of revenue or expense recognized could result 
accrued restructuring costs 
during fiscal and fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges to align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
our restructuring plan resulted in a reduction in headcount and the consolidation of facilities through the closing of excess field offices and relocation of corporate offices into one campus 
our restructuring charges included accruals for the estimated loss on facilities that we intend to sublease based on estimates of the timing and amount of sublease income and the non cash write down of leasehold improvements 
we reassess this liability each period based on market conditions 
revisions to our estimates of this liability could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions  such as the timing and amounts of sublease rental income  either change or do not materialize 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
a valuation 
table of contents allowance is currently set against deferred tax assets because management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized through the generation of future taxable income 
we also do not provide for taxes on undistributed earnings of our foreign subsidiaries  as it is our intention to reinvest undistributed earnings indefinitely 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and our future taxable income for purposes of assessing our ability to realize any future benefit from our deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods  our operating results and financial position could be materially affected 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we assess goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets may not be recoverable we measure impairment by using the projected discounted cash flow method 
in accordance with financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but instead will be subject to impairment tests at least annually 
we have adopted sfas no 
as required in connection with our acquisition of talarian in april for goodwill and intangibles recorded prior to july   we will adopt sfas no 
during the first quarter of fiscal workforce does not qualify as a separately identifiable intangible and on adoption will be reclassified as goodwill 
the adoption of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material impact on our financial position and results of operations  other than the cessation of amortization of goodwill 
accounting for investments 
we determine the appropriate classification of marketable securities at the time of purchase and evaluate such designation as of each balance sheet date 
to date  all marketable securities have been classified as available for sale and are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses  if any  included as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss in stockholders equity 
marketable securities are presented as current assets as we expect to use them within one year in current operations even though some have scheduled maturities of greater than one year 
realized gains and losses are recognized based on the specific identification method 
our investments also include minority equity investments in privately held companies that are generally carried at cost basis and included in other assets on the balance sheet 
we review our investments on a regular basis to evaluate whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporary decline in fair value 
our policy includes  but is not limited to  reviewing each of the companies cash position  earnings revenue outlook  stock price performance  liquidity and management ownership 
if we believe that an other than temporary decline exists  we write down the investment to market value and record the related write down as a loss on investments in our consolidated statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining whether an other than temporary decline in the value of our investments exists 
estimating the fair value of non marketable equity investments in early stage technology companies is inherently subjective 
changes in our assessment of the valuation of our investments could materially impact our operating results and financial position in future periods if anticipated events and key assumptions do not materialize or change

license revenue increased million  or  from to fiscal this increase was due primarily to the increased volume of sales to both new and existing customers 
license revenue was  and of total revenue in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in license revenue as a percentage of total revenue from fiscal to fiscal was due to slowing sales growth in a weakening global economy along with the increase in service and maintenance revenue

sales and marketing expenses  excluding stock based compensation charges  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal and an increase of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to decreases in commissions and referral fees partially offset by increased advertising and promotional activity

general and administrative expenses  excluding stock based compensation charges  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  representing a decrease of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal and an increase of million  or  from fiscal to fiscal the decrease in fiscal was primarily due to a decrease in bad debt and compensation expense 
the increase for fiscal was primarily a result of increased staffing and associated operational costs related to building our general and administrative infrastructure 
we believe that general and administrative expenses  exclusive of bad debt charges  will remain relatively stable in absolute dollars in fiscal stock based compensation in connection with the grant of stock options to employees  non employee directors and acquisitions during fiscal and  we recorded aggregate unearned compensation of million  representing the difference between the deemed fair value of our common stock at the date of grant and the exercise price of such options 
during fiscal  we recorded aggregate unearned compensation of million in connection with the acquisition of extensibility related to unvested options that were assumed as well as stock that was issued as part of the consideration for the acquisition and held in an escrow account 
such amounts are presented as a reduction of stockholders equity and are amortized over the vesting period of the applicable option or restricted stock  and are shown by expense category 
during the second fiscal quarter of  we recorded million of unearned compensation in connection with unvested options and restricted stock assumed on consummation of the acquisition of talarian 
in addition  as of november   we expect to record additional acquisition related compensation expense of up to million in connection with additional cash consideration contingent on the vesting and exercise of stock options and restricted stock that were unvested at the acquisition date 
stock based compensation expense related to employees  non employee directors  extensibility and talarian was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
we expect to amortize million  million and million of unearned stock based compensation in fiscal  and respectively 
stock based compensation expense related to stock options granted to consultants is recognized as earned using the multiple option method  and is shown by expense category 
at each reporting date  we re value the 
table of contents underlying stock options using the black scholes option pricing model 
as a result  stock based compensation expense will fluctuate as the fair value of our common stock fluctuates 
in connection with the grant of stock options to consultants  we recorded stock based compensation income of million in fiscal and stock based compensation expense of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
in fiscal  and  we recognized million  million and million  respectively  as stock compensation expense related to the employer portion of payroll taxes due as a result of employee exercise of non qualified stock options 
acquired in process research and development management estimated that million of the purchase price of talarian in fiscal and million of the purchase price of extensibility in fiscal represented acquired in process research and development iprd that had not yet reached technological feasibility and has no alternative future use 
accordingly  these amounts were immediately charged to expense upon consummation of the acquisitions 
independent third party sources calculated the value of iprd by estimating the expected cash flows from the projects once commercially viable  discounting the net cash flows back to their present value and then applying a percentage of completion 
in determining the value ultimately assigned to iprd we considered the stage of completion  complexity of work to date  difficulty of completing the remaining development  costs already incurred and the expected cost to complete the project 
the projects have subsequently been completed within management s estimates 
restructuring charge during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million  consisting of million for headcount reductions  million for consolidation of facilities and million of other related restructuring charges 
these restructuring charges were recorded to align our cost structure with changing market conditions 
the plan resulted in headcount reduction of approximately employees  which was made up of sales and marketing staff  professional services staff  general and administrative staff and research and development staff 
the plan also included the consolidation of facilities by closing excess field offices and moving our corporate offices into one campus 
during fiscal  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million  consisting of million for headcount reductions and million related to properties abandoned in connection with facilities consolidation 
the additional facilities charges resulted from revisions of our estimates of future sublease income due to further deterioration of real estate market conditions and on going negotiations with potential sublessors 
the headcount reduction of approximately employees was comprised of sales and marketing staff  professional services staff  general and administrative staff  and research and development staff 
during fiscal  we made cash payments of million associated with previously abandoned facilities and million related to headcount reductions 
in connection with the acquisition of talarian in the second quarter  the company recorded acquisition integration liabilities including the incremental costs to exit and consolidate activities at talarian locations  to involuntarily terminate talarian employees  and for other costs to integrate operating locations and other activities of talarian with those of the company 
generally accepted accounting principles require that these acquisition integration expenses  which are not associated with the generation of future revenues and have no future economic benefit  be reflected as assumed liabilities in the allocation of the purchase price to the net assets acquired 
the components of the acquisition integration liabilities include workforce reductions and facilities related costs 

table of contents the following sets forth our accrued excess facilities costs as of november  these costs represent our estimated loss on abandoned facilities  net of sublease income  which we expect to pay over the next eight years

income taxes due to changes in the current economic environment and based upon the weight of all available positive and negative evidence  management has determined that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be utilized  and accordingly  a full valuation allowance has been recorded for the year ended november  as of november   our federal and state net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes were million and million  respectively  which expire through as of november   our federal and state tax credit carryforwards for income tax purposes were million and million

table of contents factors that may affect operating results the following risk factors could materially and adversely affect our future operating results and could cause actual events to differ materially from those predicted in forward looking statements related to our business 
we have a history of losses and we expect future losses  and if we do not achieve and sustain profitability our business will suffer and our stock price may decline 
we may not be able to achieve revenue or earnings growth or obtain sufficient revenue to achieve and sustain profitability 
we incurred net losses of approximately million  million  and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
as of november   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we have invested significantly in building our sales and marketing organization and in our technology research and development 
we expect to continue to spend financial and other resources on developing and introducing enhancements to our existing and new software products and our direct sales and marketing activities 
as a result  we need to generate significant revenue to achieve and maintain profitability 
our future revenue is unpredictable  and we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate  which may cause our stock price to decline 
period to period comparisons of our operating results may not be a good indication of our future performance 
moreover  our operating results in some quarters has not in the past  and may not in the future  meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
this has in the past and may in the future cause our stock price to decline 
as a result of our limited operating history and the evolving nature of the markets in which we compete  we have difficulty accurately forecasting our revenue in any given period 
in addition to the factors discussed elsewhere in this section  a number of factors may cause our revenue to fall short of our expectations or cause fluctuations in our operating results  including the announcement or introduction of new or enhanced products or services by our competitors  the amount and timing of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to the expansion of our operations  the capital and expense budgeting decisions of our customers  which have recently been scrutinized at a higher level within our customers organizations  and are closely related to macroeconomic factors such as the current recession  and the current recession that could be exacerbated if the united states were to enter into a war 
in addition  our quarterly operating results are subject to variations throughout the year due to seasonal factors  which generally result in lower sales activity in our first and third fiscal quarters 
there can be no assurance that any of our customers will continue to purchase our products in the future 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our customers 
there can be no assurance that any of our customers will continue to purchase our products in the future 
as a result  a customer that generates substantial revenue for us in one period may not be a source of revenue in subsequent periods 
we are exposed to the credit risk of some of our customers and to credit exposures in weakened markets 
most of our licenses are on an open credit basis  with payment terms of days typically in the united states  and  because of local customs or conditions  longer in some markets outside the united states 
we monitor individual customer payment capability in granting such open credit arrangements  seek to limit such 
table of contents open credit to amounts we believe the customers can pay  and maintain reserves we believe are adequate to cover exposure for doubtful accounts 
because of the current slowdown in the global economy  our exposure to credit risks have increased 
although we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate the associated risk  including monitoring of particular risks in certain geographic areas  there can be no assurance that such programs will be effective in reducing our credit risks 
there can be no assurance that  should economic conditions not improve  additional losses would not be incurred  and that such losses would not be material 
although these losses have not been material to date  future losses  if incurred  could harm our business and have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our licensing and distribution relationship with reuters places limitations on our ability to conduct our business 
our predecessor company was acquired by reuters in in january  reuters established us as a separate entity  transferred to us certain assets and liabilities related to our business and granted to us a royalty free license to intellectual property that is still incorporated into some of our software products 
reuters continues to hold approximately of our stock and has the right to nominate one third of our directors  and accordingly is able to exert significant influence over our business 
we have a significant relationship with reuters for licensing and distribution 
our relationship with reuters involves limitations and restrictions on our business  as well as other risks described below 
we license from reuters the underlying tib messaging technology that existed as of december  licensed tib technology  from which some of our important tibco activeenterprise messaging products originated 
we do not own the licensed tib technology 
because reuters has access to the intellectual property used in our products  it could use this intellectual property to compete with us 
reuters is not restricted from using the licensed tib technology to produce products that compete with our products  and it can grant limited licenses to the licensed tib technology to others who may compete with us 
in addition  we must license to reuters all of the intellectual property and products we create through december this will place reuters in a position to more easily develop products that compete with ours 
under our agreements with reuters  unless otherwise authorized by reuters  we are generally prohibited  through may   from selling our products and providing consulting services directly to companies in the financial services market 
we are also prohibited from directly licensing products containing the licensed tib technology to financial services customers and major competitors of reuters  and from using the licensed tib technology to develop products specifically for use by financial services companies 
accordingly  through may   we must rely on reuters and  to a lesser extent  other third party resellers and distributors to sell our products to these companies 
after may   we may be able to license our products except for those  if any  that still include the licensed tib technology and provide consulting services directly to companies in the financial services market 
there are no assurances  however  that we will be successful in licensing our products or providing consulting services directly to companies in the financial services market which could harm our business and our operating results may suffer 
under the license  maintenance and distribution agreement  reuters is required to pay us a minimum guaranteed distribution fee in the amount of million per year through december if actual distribution fees due from reuters  as a result of their sales of our products in the financial services market  exceed the cumulative minimum year to date guarantee  incremental fees are due 
these product fees may be materially less than the product fees we could obtain from other distributors or resellers in the financial services market 
in addition  when we sell our products into the financial services market other than through reuters  we are required to pay fees to reuters  which we record as related party royalty expense 
neither reuters nor any third party reseller or distributor has any contractual obligation to distribute our products to financial services customers 
reuters and other distributors may not be successful in selling our 
table of contents products into the financial services market  or they may elect to sell competitive third party products into that market  either of which may adversely affect our revenue in that market 
in addition  if reuters declines to continue the minimum guaranteed distribution fee at the end of december  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in generating enough revenue to replace the minimum guaranteed distribution fee which would adversely affect our business and operating results 
our license agreement with reuters imposes practical restrictions on our ability to acquire other companies 
the license agreement places no specific restrictions on our ability to acquire companies with all or part of their business in the financial services market and to continue such business 
however  under the terms of the license agreement  we are prohibited from bundling or combining our products that are based on the licensed tib technology with an acquired company s products and services and then selling the bundled or combined products directly to financial services companies 
this prohibition could prevent us from realizing potential synergies with companies we acquire 
the market for infrastructure software may not grow as quickly as we anticipate  which would cause our revenues to fall below expectations 
the market for infrastructure software is relatively new and evolving 
we earn substantially all of our revenue from sales of our infrastructure software  including application integration software  and related services 
we expect to earn substantially all of our revenue in the foreseeable future from sales of these products and services 
our future financial performance will depend on growth in the number of organizations demanding software and services for application integration  information delivery and seeking outside vendors to develop  manage and maintain this software for their critical applications 
a weakening united states and global economy  which has had a disproportionate impact on information technology spending by businesses  has led to a reduction in sales over the past several quarters and may continue to do so in the future 
many of our potential customers have made significant investments in internally developed systems and would incur significant costs in switching to third party products  which may substantially inhibit the growth of the market for infrastructure software 
if the market fails to grow  or grows more slowly than we expect  our sales will be adversely affected 
our acquisition strategy could cause financial or operational problems 
our success depends on our ability to continually enhance and broaden our product offerings in response to changing technologies  customer demands  and competitive pressures 
to this end  we may acquire new and complementary businesses  products or technologies 
we do not know if we will be able to complete any acquisitions or that we will be able to successfully integrate any acquired business  operate them profitably  or retain their key employees 
integrating any newly acquired business  product or technology could be expensive and time consuming  could disrupt our ongoing business  and could distract our management 
we may face competition for acquisition targets from larger and more established companies with greater financial resources 
in addition  in order to finance any acquisitions  we might need to raise additional funds through public or private financings 
in that event  we could be forced to obtain equity or debt financing on terms that are not favorable to us and  in the case of equity financing  that results in dilution to our stockholders 
if we were unable to integrate any newly acquired entity  products or technology effectively  our business  financial condition and operating results would suffer 
in addition  any amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets  stock based compensation or other charges resulting from the costs of acquisitions could harm our operating results 
our stock price may be volatile  which could cause investors to lose all or part of their investments in our stock 
the stock market in general  and the stock prices of technology companies in particular  have experienced volatility which has often been unrelated to the operating performance of any particular company or companies 
during fiscal  for example  our stock price fluctuated between a high of and a low of 
if 
table of contents market or industry based fluctuations continue  our stock price could decline in the future regardless of our actual operating performance and investors could lose all or part of their investments 
the volatile nature of our market could strain our resources and cause our business to suffer 
our ability to successfully offer products and services and implement our business plan in a rapidly evolving market requires an effective planning and management process 
we have increased the scope of our operations both domestically and internationally 
we must successfully integrate these new employees into our operations and generate sufficient revenues to justify the costs associated with these employees 
if we fail to successfully integrate employees or to generate the revenue necessary to offset employee related expenses  we could be forced to reduce our headcount  which would force us to incur significant expenses and would harm our business and operating results 
for example  in response to changing market conditions  in fiscal we recorded a restructuring charge of million  including million related to a reduction of our headcount by approximately employees 
during fiscal  we recorded additional restructuring charges of million related to abandoned facilities and million related to a reduction of our headcount by approximately employees 
our growth has placed and will continue to place a significant strain on our management systems  infrastructure and resources 
we expect that we will need to continue to improve our financial and managerial controls  reporting systems and procedures 
we will also need to continue to train and manage our workforce worldwide 
furthermore  we expect that we will be required to manage an increasing number of relationships with various customers and other third parties 
failure to expand or control costs in any of the foregoing areas efficiently and effectively could interfere with the growth of our business as a whole 
pending litigation could harm our business 
we  certain of our directors and officers  and certain investment bank underwriters have been named in a putative class action for violation of the federal securities laws in the united states district court for the southern district of new york  captioned in re tibco software  inc initial public offering securities litigation  civ 
sas 
this is one of a number of cases challenging underwriting practices in the initial public offerings ipos of more than companies 
these cases have been coordinated for pretrial proceedings as in re initial public offering securities litigation  mc sas 
plaintiffs generally allege that certain underwriters engaged in undisclosed and improper underwriting activities  namely the receipt of excessive brokerage commissions and customer agreements regarding post offering purchases of stock in exchange for allocations of ipo shares 
plaintiffs also allege that various investment bank securities analysts issued false and misleading analyst reports 
the complaint against us claims that the purported improper underwriting activities were not disclosed in the registration statements for our ipo and secondary public offering and seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased our securities or sold put options during the time period from july  to december  we believe that we have meritorious defenses to the claims against us and we intend to defend ourselves vigorously 
on march   a stipulation and order were entered pursuant to which the individual defendants and we were dismissed without prejudice from claims relating to our initial public offering 
we believe that the remaining claims against us are without merit and we intend to defend against the complaints vigorously 
a lawsuit with similar allegations of undisclosed improper underwriting practices  and part of the same coordinated proceedings  is pending against talarian  which we acquired in that action is captioned  in re talarian corp 
initial public offering securities litigation  civ 
sas 
the complaint against talarian  certain of its underwriters  and certain of its former directors and officers claims that the purported improper underwriting activities were not disclosed in the registration statement for talarian s ipo and seeks unspecified damages on behalf of a purported class of persons who purchased talarian securities during the time period from july  to december  we believe that there are meritorious defenses to the claims against talarian and we intend to defend against those claims vigorously 
the remaining complaints do not specify the amount of damages that the plaintiffs seek  and as a result  we are unable to estimate the possible range of damages that might be incurred as a result of the lawsuits 
we have 
table of contents not accrued any amounts relating to potential damages associated with the lawsuits 
the uncertainty associated with a substantial unresolved lawsuit could harm our business  financial condition and reputation 
the defense of the lawsuits could result in the diversion of our management s time and attention away from business operations  which could harm our business 
negative developments with respect to the lawsuits could cause our stock price to decline 
in addition  although we are unable to determine the amount  if any  that we may be required to pay in connection with the resolution of the lawsuits by settlement or otherwise  such a payment could seriously harm our financial condition and liquidity 
if we do not retain our key management personnel and attract and retain other highly skilled employees  our business will suffer 
if we fail to retain and recruit the necessary personnel  our business and our ability to obtain new customers  develop new products and provide acceptable levels of customer service could suffer 
the success of our business is heavily dependent on the leadership of our key management personnel  including vivek ranadive  our president and chief executive officer 
all of our executive officers and key personnel are employees at will 
if any of these people were to leave us it would be difficult to replace them and our business would be harmed 
in addition  provisions of the recently enacted sarbanes oxley act of and related rules proposed by the sec and nasdaq impose heightened personal liability on some of our key management personnel 
the threat of such liability could potentially divert the attention of such personnel away from their normal management duties 
our success also depends on our ability to recruit  retain and motivate highly skilled sales  marketing and engineering personnel 
competition for these people in the software industries is intense  and we may not be able to successfully recruit  train or retain qualified personnel 
in addition  we have experienced turnover in our marketing and sales management 
although we have recruited a new marketing manager  there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our retention and training efforts 
our products may infringe the intellectual property rights of others  which may cause us to incur unexpected costs or prevent us from selling our products 
we cannot be certain that our products do not infringe issued patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
because patent applications in the united states are not publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  applications relating to our software products may have been filed without our knowledge 
we may be subject to legal proceedings and claims from time to time  including claims of alleged infringement of the patents  trademarks and other intellectual property rights of third parties by us or our licensees in connection with their use of our products 
intellectual property litigation is expensive and time consuming  and could divert our management s attention away from running our business and could seriously harm our business 
if we were to discover that our products violated the intellectual property rights of others  we would have to obtain licenses from these parties in order to continue marketing our products without substantial reengineering 
we might not be able to obtain the necessary licenses on acceptable terms or at all  and if we could not obtain such licenses  we might not be able to reengineer our products successfully or in a timely fashion 
if we fail to address any infringement issues successfully  we will be forced to incur significant costs and could be prevented from selling our products 
our intellectual property or proprietary rights could be misappropriated  which could force us to become involved in expensive and time consuming litigation 
we regard our copyrights  service marks  trademarks  trade secrets  licensed patents and similar intellectual property as critical to our success 
any misappropriation of our proprietary information by third parties could harm our business  financial condition  and operating results 
if our proprietary information were misappropriated  we might have to engage in litigation to protect it 
we might not succeed in protecting our proprietary information by initiating intellectual property litigation  and in any invent such litigation is expensive and time consuming  and could divert our management s attention away from running our business and could seriously harm our business 

table of contents we must overcome significant competition in order to succeed 
the market for our products and services is extremely competitive and subject to rapid change 
we compete with various providers of enterprise application integration solutions  including webmethods and seebeyond 
we also compete with various providers of webservices such as microsoft  bea and ibm 
we believe that of these companies  ibm has the potential to offer the most complete set of products for enterprise application integration 
we also face competition for certain aspects of our product and service offerings from major systems integrators 
we expect additional competition from other established and emerging companies 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  product development and marketing resources  greater name recognition and larger customer bases than we do 
our present or future competitors may be able to develop products comparable or superior to those we offer  adapt more quickly than we do to new technologies  evolving industry trends or customer requirements  or devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their products than we do 
accordingly  we may not be able to compete effectively in our markets or competition may intensify and harm our business and operating results 
if we are not successful in developing enhancements to existing products and new products in a timely manner  achieving customer acceptance or generating higher average selling prices  our gross margins may decline  and our business and operating results may suffer 
market acceptance of new platforms and web services standards may require us to undergo the expense of developing and maintaining compatible product lines 
our software products can be licensed for use with a variety of platforms 
there may be future or existing platforms that achieve popularity in the marketplace which may or may not be architecturally compatible with our software products 
in addition  the effort and expense of developing  testing and maintaining software products will increase as more platforms achieve market acceptance within our target markets 
moreover  future or existing user interfaces that achieve popularity within the enterprise application integration marketplace may or may not be compatible with our current software products 
if we are unable to achieve market acceptance of our software product or adapt to new platforms  our sales and revenues may be adversely affected 
developing and maintaining different software products could place a significant strain on our resources and software product release schedules  which could adversely affect our revenue and financial condition 
if we are not able to develop software for accepted platforms or fail to adopt webservice standards  our license and service revenues could be adversely affected 
in addition  if the platforms we have developed software for are not accepted  our license and service revenues could be adversely affected 
recently enacted and proposed regulatory changes may cause us to incur increased costs 
recently enacted and proposed changes in the laws and regulations affecting public companies  including the provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of and rules proposed by the sec and nasdaq could cause us to incur increased costs as we evaluate the implications of new rules and responds to new requirements 
the new rules could make it more difficult for us to obtain certain types of insurance  including directors and officer liability insurance  and we may be forced to accept reduced policy limits and coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain the same or similar coverage 
the impact of these events could also make it more difficult for us to attract and retain qualified persons to serve on the company s board of directors  or as executive officers 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring developments with respect to these new and proposed rules  and we cannot predict or estimate the amount of the additional costs we may incur or the timing of such costs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we invest in marketable securities in accordance with our investment policy 
the primary objectives of our investment policy are to preserve principal  maintain proper liquidity to meet operating needs and maximize yields 
our investment policy specifies credit quality standards for our investments and limits the amount of 
table of contents credit exposure to any single issue  issuer or type of investment 
the maximum allowable duration of a single issue is years and the maximum allowable duration of the portfolio is years 
at the end of fiscal  and  we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities totaling million  million and million  excluding those classified as cash and cash equivalents and restricted funds  respectively 
our investments consist primarily of bank and finance notes  various government obligations and asset backed securities 
these securities are classified as available for sale and are recorded on the balance sheet at fair market value with unrealized gains or losses reported as a separate component of stockholders equity 
unrealized losses are charged against income when a decline in fair market value is determined to be other than temporary 
the specific identification method is used to determine the cost of securities sold 
the investment portfolio is subject to interest rate risk and will fall in value in the event market interest rates increase 
if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by basis points approximately of current rates in the portfolio from levels as of november   the fair market value of the portfolio would decline by approximately million 
we develop products in the united states and sell in north america  south america  asia  the middle east and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
a majority of sales are currently made in us dollars  however  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
we enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts forward contracts to manage exposure related to accounts receivable denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
we had outstanding forward contracts with notional amounts totaling approximately million  million and million at november   and  respectively 
the open contracts at november  mature at various dates through january and are economic hedges of certain foreign currency transaction exposures in the euro 
the fair value of these forward contracts at november  was not significant
