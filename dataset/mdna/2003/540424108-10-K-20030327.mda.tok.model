other competition the property and casualty and life and health insurance industry is highly competitive both as to rate and service 
cna s consolidated property and casualty subsidiaries compete not only with other stock insurance companies  but also with mutual insurance companies  reinsurance companies and other entities for both producers and customers 
cna must continuously allocate resources to refine and improve its insurance and reinsurance products and services 
rates among insurers vary according to the types of insurers and methods of operation 
cna competes for business not only on the basis of rate  but also on the basis of availability of coverage desired by customers and quality of service  including claim adjustment services 
there are approximately  individual companies that sell property and casualty insurance in the united states 
cna s consolidated property and casualty subsidiaries ranked as the ninth largest property and casualty insurance organization in the united states based upon statutory net written premiums 
cna re  cna s principal property and casualty assumed reinsurance operation  ranked as the th largest property and casualty reinsurance organization in the united states based upon statutory net written premiums 
there are approximately companies selling life and health insurance in the united states 
cna s consolidated life insurance companies are ranked as the st largest life health insurance organization in the united states based on statutory net written premiums 
regulation the insurance industry is subject to comprehensive and detailed regulation and supervision throughout the united states 
each state has established supervisory agencies with broad administrative powers relative to licensing insurers and agents  approving policy forms  establishing reserve requirements  fixing minimum interest rates for accumulation of surrender values and maximum interest rates of policy loans  prescribing the form and content of statutory financial reports and regulating solvency and the type and amount of investments permitted 
such regulatory powers also extend to premium rate regulations  which require that rates not be excessive  inadequate or unfairly discriminatory 
in addition to regulation of dividends by insurance subsidiaries  intercompany transfers of assets may be subject to prior notice or approval by the state insurance regulator  depending on the size of such transfers and payments in relation to the financial position of the insurance affiliates making the transfer or payments 
insurers are also required by the states to provide coverage to insureds who would not otherwise be considered eligible by the insurers 
each state dictates the types of insurance and the level of coverage that must be provided to such involuntary risks 
cna s share of these involuntary risks is mandatory and generally a function of its respective share of the voluntary market by line of insurance in each state 
insurance companies are subject to state guaranty fund and other insurance related assessments 
guaranty fund and other insurance related assessments are levied by the state departments of insurance to cover claims of insolvent insurers 
reform of the us tort liability system is another issue facing the insurance industry 
over the last decade  many states have passed some type of reform  but more recently  a number of state courts have modified or overturned these reforms 
additionally  new causes of action and theories of damages continue to be proposed in state court actions or by legislatures 
continued unpredictability in the law means that insurance underwriting and rating is expected to continue to be difficult in commercial lines  professional liability and some specialty coverages 
although the federal government and its regulatory agencies do not directly regulate the business of insurance  federal legislative and regulatory initiatives can impact the insurance business in a variety of ways 
these initiatives and legislation include tort reform proposals  proposals to overhaul the superfund hazardous waste removal and liability statutes  and various tax proposals affecting insurance companies 
in  congress passed the financial services modernization or gramm leach bliley act glb act  which repealed portions of the glass steagall act and enabled closer relationships between banks and insurers 
although functional regulation was preserved by the glb act for state oversight of insurance  additional financial services modernization legislation could include provisions for an alternate federal system of regulation for insurance companies 
cna and the insurance industry incurred substantial losses related to the september  world trade center disaster and related events 
for the most part  cna believes the industry was able to absorb the loss of capital from these losses  but the capacity to withstand the effect of any additional terrorism events was significantly diminished 
cna s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital requirements 
risk based capital is a method developed by the national association of insurance commissioners naic to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile 
the formula for determining the amount of risk based capital specifies various factors  weighted based on the perceived degree of risk  that are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity 
the adequacy of a company s actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the risk based capital results  as determined by the formula 
companies below minimum risk based capital requirements are classified within certain levels  each of which determines a specified level of regulatory attention applicable to a company 
as of december  and  all of cna s domestic insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum risk based capital requirements 
subsidiaries with insurance operations outside the united states are also subject to regulation in the countries in which they operate 
cna has operations in the united kingdom  canada  and other countries 
terrorism on november   the president of the united states of america signed into law the terrorism risk insurance act of the act  which establishes a program within the department of the treasury under which the federal government will share the risk of loss from future terrorist attacks with the insurance industry 
the act terminates on december  each participating insurance company must pay a deductible before federal government assistance becomes available 
this deductible is based on a percentage of direct earned premiums for commercial insurance lines from the previous calendar year  and rises from from date of enactment to december  the transition period to during the first subsequent calendar year  in year two and in year three 
for losses in excess of a company s deductible  the federal government will cover of the excess losses  while companies retain the remaining 
losses covered by the program will be capped annually at billion  above this amount  insurers are not liable for covered losses and congress is to determine the procedures for and the source of any payments 
amounts paid by the federal government under the program over certain phased limits are to be recouped by the department of the treasury through policy surcharges  which cannot exceed of annual premium 
insurance companies providing commercial property and casualty insurance are required to participate in the program  but it does not cover life or health insurance products 
state law limitations applying to premiums and policies for terrorism coverage are not generally affected under the program  but they are pre empted in relation to prior approval requirements for rates and forms 
the act has policyholder notice requirements in order for insurers to be reimbursed for terrorism related losses and  from the date of enactment until december   a mandatory offer requirement for terrorism coverage  although it may be rejected by insureds 
the secretary of the department of the treasury has discretion to extend this offer requirement until december while the act provides the property and casualty industry with an increased ability to withstand the effect of a terrorist event during the next three years  given the unpredictability of the nature  targets  severity or frequency of potential terrorist events  the company s results of operations or equity could nevertheless be materially adversely impacted by them 
cna is attempting to mitigate this exposure through its underwriting practices  policy terms and conditions where applicable and the use of reinsurance 
in addition  under state laws cna is generally prohibited from excluding terrorism exposure from its primary workers compensation  individual life and group life and health policies and is also prohibited from excluding coverage for fire losses following a terrorist event in a number of states 
reinsurers obligations for terrorism related losses under reinsurance agreements are not covered by the act 
cna s current reinsurance arrangements either exclude terrorism coverage or significantly limit the level of coverage 
reinsurance see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and notes and of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item  for information related to cna s reinsurance activities

the principal cigarette brand names of lorillard are newport  kent  true  maverick and old gold 
lorillard s largest selling brand is newport  the second largest selling cigarette brand in the united states and the largest selling brand in the menthol segment of the us cigarette market in newport accounted for approximately of lorillard s sales in substantially all of lorillard s sales are in the united states  puerto rico and certain us territories 
lorillard s major trademarks outside of the united states were sold in lorillard accounted for  and of the company s consolidated total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the tobacco industry in the united states  including lorillard  continues to be faced with a number of issues that have or may adversely impact the business  results of operations and financial condition of lorillard and the company  including a substantial volume of litigation seeking compensatory and punitive damages ranging into the billions of dollars  as well as equitable and injunctive relief  a billion punitive damage judgment  currently under appeal  against lorillard in engle vs 
rj reynolds tobacco company  et al  substantial annual payment obligations  continuing in perpetuity  under the terms of the settlement agreements entered into between the major cigarette manufacturers  including lorillard  and each of the states  the district of columbia  the commonwealth of puerto rico and certain other us territories together  the state settlement agreements  increasing actual and proposed regulation of the tobacco industry and restrictions on smoking in public places  a continuing decline in the volume of cigarette sales in the united states  continuing and substantial increases in excise taxes  the diminishing social acceptability of smoking  increases in industry wide promotional expenses and sales incentives implemented in reaction to continuing intense competition among the four largest cigarette manufacturers and competition from discount and deep discount cigarette brands  and increasing sales of counterfeit cigarettes in the united states

see also  management s discussion and analysis results of operations lorillard  and liquidity and capital resources lorillard included in item of this report 
legislation and regulation lorillard s business operations are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws and regulations governing  among other things  publication of health warnings on cigarette packaging  advertising and sales of tobacco products  restrictions on smoking in public places and fire safety standards 
further  from time to time new legislation or regulations are proposed and reports are published by government sponsored committees and others recommending additional regulations of tobacco products 
federal regulation the federal comprehensive smoking education act  which became effective in  requires that cigarette packaging and advertising display one of the following four warning statements  on a rotating basis surgeon general s warning smoking causes lung cancer  heart disease  emphysema  and may complicate pregnancy 
surgeon general s warning quitting smoking now greatly reduces serious risks to your health 
surgeon general s warning smoking by pregnant women may result in fetal injury  premature birth  and low birth weight 
surgeon general s warning cigarette smoke contains carbon monoxide 
this law also requires that each person who manufactures  packages or imports cigarettes shall annually provide to the secretary of health and human services a list of the ingredients added to tobacco in the manufacture of cigarettes 
this list of ingredients may be submitted in a manner that does not identify the company that uses the ingredients or the brand of cigarettes that contain the ingredients 
in addition  from time to time  bills have been introduced in congress  among other things  to end or limit the price supports for leaf tobacco  to prohibit all tobacco advertising and promotion  to require new health warnings on cigarette packages and advertising  to authorize the establishment of various anti smoking education programs  to provide that current federal law should not be construed to relieve any person of liability under common or state law  to permit state and local governments to restrict the sale and distribution of cigarettes  concerning the placement of advertising of tobacco products  to provide that cigarette advertising not be deductible as a business expense  to prohibit the mailing of unsolicited samples of cigarettes and otherwise to restrict the sale or distribution of cigarettes in retail stores and over the internet  to impose an additional  or to increase existing  excise taxes on cigarettes  to require that cigarettes be manufactured in a manner that will cause them  under certain circumstances  to be self extinguishing  and to subject cigarettes to regulation in various ways by the us department of health and human services or other regulatory agencies 
in addition  in the us food and drug administration published regulations that would have extensively regulated the distribution  marketing and advertising of cigarettes  including the imposition of a wide range of labeling  reporting  record keeping  manufacturing and other requirements 
challenges to the fda s assertion of jurisdiction over cigarettes made by lorillard and other manufacturers were upheld by the supreme court in march when that court ruled that congress did not give the fda authority to regulate tobacco products under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act 
since the supreme court decision  various proposals and recommendations have been made for additional federal and state legislation to regulate cigarette manufacturers 
congressional advocates of fda regulation have introduced legislation that would give the fda authority to regulate the manufacture  sale  distribution and labeling of tobacco products to protect public health  thereby allowing the fda to reinstate its prior regulations or adopt new or additional regulations 
in december  the fda requested the institute of medicine  a private  non profit organization which advises the federal government on medical issues  to convene a committee of experts to formulate scientific methods and standards for the assessment of potentially reduced exposure products preps  including conventional and alternative cigarettes 
in february  the committee issued a report recommending that congress enact legislation enabling a suitable agency to regulate tobacco related products that purport to reduce exposure to one or more tobacco toxicants or to reduce risk of disease  and to implement other policies designed to reduce the harm from tobacco use 
the report recommended regulation of all tobacco products  including preps 
in certain public health groups petitioned the fda to assert jurisdiction over several prep type products that have been introduced into the marketplace 
these groups assert that claims made by manufacturers of these products allow the fda to regulate the manufacture  advertising and sale of these products as drugs or medical devices under the food drug and cosmetic act 
the agency has received comments on these petitions but has taken no action 
in late philip morris usa  the largest usa manufacturer of cigarettes  filed a request for rulemaking petition with the federal trade commission ftc seeking changes in the existing ftc regulatory scheme for measuring and reporting tar and nicotine to the federal government and for inclusion in cigarette advertising 
the agency procedures allow for interested parties to submit comments on this proposal 
the agency has received comments on these petitions but has taken no action 
in  the surgeon general of the united states and the national academy of sciences reported that environmental tobacco smoke ets exposes nonsmokers to an increased risk of lung cancer and respiratory illness 
in addition  in  the united states environmental protection agency released a report the epa risk assessment concluding that ets is a human lung carcinogen in adults  and causes respiratory effects in children  including increased risk of lower respiratory tract infections  increased prevalence of fluid in the middle ear and additional episodes and increased severity and frequency of asthma 
in july  a federal district court judge struck down the lung cancer related portions of the epa s scientific risk assessment 
in an opinion issued in december  the federal fourth circuit court of appeal overturned the district court s decision on procedural grounds  and vacated the decision 
the time in which an appeal may be lodged has not yet expired 
in may  the department of health and human service s national toxicology program listed ets as known to be a human carcinogen 
various public health organizations have also issued statements on environmental tobacco smoke and its health effects and many scientific papers on ets have been published since the epa risk assessment  with varying conclusions 
lorillard cannot predict the ultimate outcome of these proposals  reports and recommendations  though if enacted  certain of these proposals could have a material adverse effect on lorillard s business and the company s financial position or results of operations in the future 
state and local regulation in recent years  many state  local and municipal governments and agencies  as well as private businesses  have adopted legislation  regulations or policies which prohibit or restrict  or are intended to discourage  smoking  including legislation  regulations or policies prohibiting or restricting smoking in various places such as public buildings and facilities  stores  restaurants and bars and on airline flights and in the workplace 
this trend has increased significantly since the release of the epa risk assessment 
the following are examples of some of the more significant state and local regulations affecting lorillard s business in september  the california environmental protection agency released a report the cal epa report concluding that ets causes specified development  respiratory  carcinogenic  and cardiovascular effects including lung and nasal sinus cancer  heart disease  sudden infant death syndrome  respiratory infections and asthma induction and exacerbation in children 
the cal epa report was subsequently released as a monograph by the national cancer institute in november of the california air resources board is in the early stages of the process of determining whether to identify ets as a toxic air contaminant  or tac  under the toxic air contaminant identification and control act  a california statute referred to as the tanner act 
the children s environmental health protection act amended the tanner act to require a review of tacs for the purpose of ensuring adequate protection of children s health  and to tighten existing controls as needed 
if california  on the basis of its assessments of risk and exposure  identifies ets as a tac  california could initiate the control phase of the tanner act  which involves adoption of measures to reduce or eliminate emissions 
these measures could include further restrictions regarding venues where smoking is permitted or controls on product emissions 
the commonwealth of massachusetts has enacted legislation requiring each manufacturer of cigarettes and smokeless tobacco sold in massachusetts to submit to the state s department of public health dph an annual report identifying for each brand sold certain added constituents  and providing nicotine yield ratings and other information for certain brands based on regulations promulgated by the dph 
the provisions of the legislation that provide for the public release of this information  which includes trade secret ingredients used in cigarettes  were challenged by several cigarette manufacturers  and were found unconstitutional by a federal district court in boston and that ruling was upheld by the us circuit court of appeals for the first circuit 
the commonwealth has decided that it will not seek to appeal this decision to the us supreme court 
the state of texas has implemented legislation similar to the massachusetts law described above 
however  the texas legislation does not allow for the public release of trade secret information 
new york state has enacted legislation that requires the state s office of fire prevention and control ofpc to promulgate fire safety standards for cigarettes sold in new york and that cigarettes sold in new york meet ignition propensity performance standards established by that agency 
the law states that the effective date of regulations implementing the legislation is to be within days after final adoption of the standards 
on december   ofpc issued proposed fire safety standards for cigarettes proposing performance and testing standards pursuant to the legislation 
under applicable state administrative law  interested parties may submit comments to the agency 
the time within which to submit comments has not yet expired 
similar legislation is being considered in other states and at the federal level 
other similar laws and regulations have been enacted or considered by other state and local governments 
lorillard cannot predict the impact which these regulations may have on lorillard s business  though if enacted  they could have a material adverse effect on lorillard s business and the company s financial position or results of operations in the future 
excise taxes cigarettes are subject to substantial federal  state and local excise taxes in the united states and  in general  such taxes have been increasing 
on january   the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased by per thousand cigarettes and is now per thousand cigarettes or per pack of cigarettes 
state excise taxes  which are levied upon and paid by the distributors  are also in effect in the fifty states  the district of columbia and many municipalities 
increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales in ranged from per pack to per pack in states  and excise tax increases were implemented by several municipalities such as new york city where the local tax increased from to per pack in proposals for additional increases in federal  state and local excise taxes continue to be considered 
the state and municipal taxes generally range from to per pack of cigarettes 
advertising and marketing lorillard advertises its products to adult smokers in magazines  newspapers  direct mail and point of sale display materials 
in addition  lorillard promotes its cigarette brands to adult smokers through distribution of store coupons  retail price promotions  and personal contact with distributors and retailers 
although lorillard s sales are made primarily to wholesale distributors rather than retailers  lorillard s sales personnel monitor retail and wholesale inventories  work with retailers on displays and signs  and enter into promotional arrangements with retailers from time to time 
as a general matter  lorillard allocates its marketing expenditures among brands on the basis of marketplace opportunity and profitable return 
in particular  lorillard focuses its marketing efforts on the premium segment of the us cigarette industry  with a specific focus on newport 
advertising of tobacco products through television and radio has been prohibited since in addition  on november   lorillard and the three other largest major cigarette manufacturers entered into a master settlement agreement msa with states  the district of columbia  the commonwealth of puerto rico and certain other us territories to settle certain health care cost recovery and other claims 
these manufacturers had previously settled similar claims brought by the four remaining states which together with the msa are generally referred to as the state settlement agreements 
under the state settlement agreements the participating cigarette manufacturers agreed to severe restrictions on their advertising and promotion activities 
among other things  the msa prohibits the targeting of youth in the advertising  promotion or marketing of tobacco products  bans the use of cartoon characters in all tobacco advertising and promotion  limits each tobacco manufacturer to one event sponsorship during any twelve month period  which may not include major team sports or events in which the intended audience includes a significant percentage of youth  bans all outdoor advertising of tobacco products with the exception of small signs at retail establishments that sell tobacco products  bans tobacco manufacturers from offering or selling apparel and other merchandise that bears a tobacco brand name  subject to specified exceptions  prohibits the distribution of free samples of tobacco products except within adult only facilities  prohibits payments for tobacco product placement in various media  and bans gift offers based on the purchase of tobacco products without sufficient proof that the intended gift recipient is an adult 
many states  cities and counties have enacted legislation or regulations further restricting tobacco advertising 
there may be additional local  state and federal legislative and regulatory initiatives relating to the advertising and promotion of cigarettes in the future 
lorillard cannot predict the impact of such initiatives on its marketing and sales efforts 
lorillard has funded and plans to continue to fund a youth smoking prevention program  which is designed to discourage youth from smoking 
the program addresses not only youth  but also parents and  through the we card program  retailers  to prevent purchase of cigarettes by underage purchasers 
lorillard has determined not to advertise its cigarettes in magazines with large readership among people under the age of distribution methods lorillard sells its products primarily to distributors  who in turn service retail outlets  chain store organizations  and government agencies  including the us armed forces 
upon completion of the manufacturing process  lorillard ships cigarettes to public distributing warehouse facilities for rapid order fulfillment to wholesalers and other direct buying customers 
lorillard retains a portion of its manufactured cigarettes at its greensboro central distribution center and greensboro cold storage facility for future finished goods replenishment 
as of december   lorillard had approximately direct buying customers servicing more than  retail accounts 
lorillard does not sell cigarettes directly to consumers 
during  and  sales made by lorillard to mclane company  inc  a wholesale distributor wholly owned by wal mart stores  inc  comprised  and  respectively  of lorillard s revenues 
no other customer accounted for more than of  or sales 
lorillard does not have any backlog orders 
most of lorillard s customers buy cigarettes on a next day delivery basis 
approximately of lorillard s customers purchase cigarettes using electronic funds transfer  which provides immediate payment to lorillard 
raw materials and manufacturing in its production of cigarettes  lorillard uses burley leaf tobacco  and flue cured leaf tobacco grown in the united states and abroad  and aromatic tobacco grown primarily in turkey and other near eastern countries 
a domestic supplier manufactures all of lorillard s reconstituted tobacco 
lorillard purchases more than of its domestic leaf tobacco from dimon international  inc lorillard directs dimon in the purchase of tobacco according to lorillard s specifications for quality  grade  yield  particle size  moisture content and other characteristics 
dimon purchases and processes the whole leaf and then dries and packages it for shipment to and storage at lorillard s danville  virginia facility 
dimon historically has procured most of lorillard s leaf tobacco requirements through commission buyers at tobacco auctions 
however  the tobacco industry is currently shifting to direct contract purchasing from tobacco farmers 
dimon has stated in its public filings that it believes it is well prepared to participate in direct contracting with tobacco farmers in the united states and that it does not expect any material economic effect from the progressive shift from the auction system to direct contract buying 
lorillard entered into a new contract with dimon to reflect the transition from auction to direct contract purchasing 
in the event that dimon becomes unwilling or unable to supply leaf tobacco to lorillard  lorillard believes that it can readily obtain high quality leaf tobacco from well established  alternative industry sources 
due to the varying size and quality of annual crops and other economic factors  including us tobacco production controls administered by the united states department of agriculture  tobacco prices have historically fluctuated 
the us price supports that accompany production controls have inflated the market price of tobacco 
in addition  the transition in tobacco purchasing from auction markets to direct farmer contracting may increase the market price of domestically grown tobacco 
however  lorillard does not believe that this increase  if any  will have a material effect on its business lorillard stores its tobacco in storage warehouses on its acre danville facility 
to protect against loss  amounts of all types and grades of tobacco are stored in separate warehouses 
because the process of aging tobacco normally requires approximately two years  lorillard maintains large quantities of leaf tobacco at all times 
lorillard believes its current tobacco supplies are adequately balanced for its present production requirements 
if necessary  lorillard can purchase aged tobacco in the open markets to supplement existing inventories 
lorillard produces cigarettes at its greensboro  north carolina manufacturing plant  which has a production capacity of approximately million cigarettes per day and approximately billion cigarettes per year 
through various automated systems and sensors  lorillard actively monitors all phases of production to promote quality and compliance with applicable regulations 
prices lorillard believes that the volume of us cigarette sales is sensitive to price changes 
changes in pricing by lorillard or other cigarette manufacturers could have an adverse impact on lorillard s volume of units sold  which in turn could have an adverse impact on lorillard s profits and earnings 
lorillard makes independent pricing decisions based on a number of factors 
lorillard cannot predict the potential adverse impact of price changes on industry volume or lorillard volume  on the mix between premium and discount sales  on lorillard s market share or on lorillard s profits and earnings 
during  lorillard increased its net wholesale price of its cigarettes by an aggregate of per thousand cigarettes per pack of cigarettes 
properties lorillard s manufacturing facility is located on approximately acres in greensboro  north carolina 
this  square foot plant contains modern high speed cigarette manufacturing machinery 
the greensboro facility also includes a warehouse with shipping and receiving areas totaling  square feet 
in addition  lorillard owns tobacco receiving and storage facilities totaling approximately  square feet in danville  virginia 
lorillard s executive offices are located in a  square foot  four story office building in greensboro  north carolina 
its  square foot research facility is also located in greensboro 
lorillard s principal properties are owned in fee 
with minor exceptions  lorillard owns all of the machinery it uses 
lorillard believes that its properties and machinery are in generally good condition 
lorillard leases sales offices in major cities throughout the united states  a cold storage facility in greensboro and warehousing space in public distributing warehouses located throughout the united states 
competition the domestic us market for cigarettes is highly competitive 
competition is primarily based on a brand s price  positioning  consumer loyalty  retail display  promotion  quality and taste 
lorillard s principal competitors are the three other major us cigarette manufacturers  philip morris  rj reynolds and brown williamson 
lorillard believes its ability to compete even more effectively has been restrained by the philip morris retail leaders program 
the terms of philip morris merchandising contracts preclude lorillard from obtaining visible space in the retail store to effectively promote its brands 
as a result in a large number of retail locations  lorillard either has a severely limited or no opportunity to competitively support its promotion programs thereby limiting its sales potential 
lorillard s market share of the us domestic cigarette industry was fourth highest overall 
philip morris  rj reynolds and brown williamson accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of wholesale shipments in among the four major manufacturers  lorillard ranked third behind philip morris and rj reynolds with an share of the premium segment in the following table sets forth cigarette sales data provided by the industry and by lorillard to management science associates 
for reporting purposes  unit sales by small manufacturers  selling deep discounted brands  many of whom are not currently affected to a significant degree by payment obligations under the state settlement agreements  are estimated by management science associates 
the table below indicates the relative position of lorillard in the us each of these years has been restated to reflect management science associates estimates for the small manufacturers shipments 
lorillard industry lorillard to calendar year industry management science associates divides the cigarette market into two price segments  the premium price segment and the discount or reduced price segment 
according to management science associates  the discount segment share of market increased from approximately in to in virtually all of lorillard s sales are in the full price segment where lorillard s share amounted to approximately in and in  as reported by management science associates

the hotels are constructed on land leased by the joint venture from the resort s owners and are being operated by loews hotels pursuant to a management contract 
the hotels which are operated by loews hotels contain shops  a variety of restaurants and lounges  and some contain parking facilities  swimming pools  tennis courts and access to golf courses 
the hotels owned by loews hotels are subject to mortgage indebtedness aggregating approximately million at december  with interest rates ranging from to and maturing between and in addition  certain hotels are held under leases which are subject to formula derived rental increases  with rentals aggregating approximately million for the year ended december  competition from other hotels  motor hotels and inns  including facilities owned by local interests and by national and international chains  is vigorous in all areas in which loews hotels operates 
the demand for hotel rooms in many areas is seasonal and dependent on general and local economic conditions 
loews hotels properties also compete with facilities offering similar services in locations other than those in which its hotels are located 
competition among luxury hotels is based primarily on location and service 
competition among resort and commercial hotels is based on price as well as location and service 
because of the competitive nature of the industry  hotels must continually make expenditures for updating  refurnishing and repairs and maintenance  in order to prevent competitive obsolescence 
diamond offshore drilling  inc 
diamond offshore drilling inc diamond offshore  is engaged  through its subsidiaries  in the business of owning and operating drilling rigs that are used primarily in the drilling of offshore oil and gas wells on a contract basis for companies engaged in exploration and production of hydrocarbons 
diamond offshore operates offshore rigs 
diamond offshore accounted for  and of the company s consolidated total revenue for the years ended december   and  respectively 
drilling units and equipment diamond offshore currently owns and operates mobile offshore drilling rigs semisubmersible rigs  jack up rigs and one drillship and related equipment  including the march of acquisition of a third generation semisubmersible drilling rig for million 
offshore rigs are mobile units that can be relocated via either self propulsion or the use of tugs enabling them to be repositioned based on market demand 
semisubmersible rigs are supported by large pontoons and are partially submerged during drilling for greater stability 
they are generally designed for water depths of up to  feet 
semisubmersibles are typically anchored in position and remain stable for drilling in the semi submerged floating position due in part to their wave transparency characteristics at the water line 
semisubmersibles can also be held in position through the use of a computer controlled thruster dynamic positioning system to maintain the rig s position over a drillsite 
diamond offshore has three such semisubmersible rigs 
diamond offshore owns and operates eight high specification semisubmersible rigs 
these semisubmersibles are larger than many other semisubmersibles  are capable of working in deep water or harsh environments  and have other advanced features 
diamond offshore s semisubmersible rigs are currently located as follows in the gulf of mexico  four in the north sea and four in brazil  with the remaining rigs located in various foreign markets 
diamond offshore owns and operates jack up rigs 
these rigs stand on the ocean floor with their drilling platforms jacked up on support legs above the water 
they are used extensively for drilling in water depths from feet to feet 
eleven of diamond offshore s jack up rigs are cantilevered rigs capable of over platform development drilling and workover as well as exploratory drilling 
twelve of diamond offshore s jack up rigs are currently located in the gulf of mexico 
diamond offshore s drillship is self propelled and designed to drill in deep water 
shaped like a conventional vessel  it is the most mobile of the major rig types 
diamond offshore s drillship has dynamic positioning capabilities and is currently operating in brazil 
markets diamond offshore s principal markets for its offshore contract drilling services are the gulf of mexico  europe  including principally the uk and norwegian sectors of the north sea  south america  africa  and australia southeast asia 
diamond offshore actively markets its rigs worldwide 
diamond offshore contracts to provide offshore drilling services vary in their terms and provisions 
diamond offshore often obtains its contracts through competitive bidding  although it is not unusual for diamond offshore to be awarded drilling contracts without competitive bidding 
drilling contracts generally provide for a basic drilling rate on a fixed dayrate basis regardless of whether such drilling results in a productive well 
drilling contracts may also provide for lower rates during periods when the rig is being moved or when drilling operations are interrupted or restricted by equipment breakdowns  adverse weather or water conditions or other conditions beyond the control of diamond offshore 
under dayrate contracts  diamond offshore generally pays the operating expenses of the rig  including wages and the cost of incidental supplies 
dayrate contracts have historically accounted for a substantial portion of diamond offshore s revenues 
in addition  diamond offshore has worked some of its rigs under dayrate contracts pursuant to which the customer also agrees to pay diamond offshore an incentive bonus based upon performance 
a dayrate drilling contract generally extends over a period of time covering either the drilling of a single well  a group of wells a well to well contract or a stated term a term contract and may be terminated by the customer in the event the drilling unit is destroyed or lost or if drilling operations are suspended for a specified period of time as a result of a breakdown of equipment or  in some cases  due to other events beyond the control of either party 
in addition  certain of diamond offshore s contracts permit the customer to terminate the contract early by giving notice and in some circumstances may require the payment of an early termination fee by the customer 
the contract term in many instances may be extended by the customer exercising options for the drilling of additional wells at fixed or mutually agreed terms  including dayrates 
the duration of offshore drilling contracts is generally determined by market demand and the respective management strategies of the offshore drilling contractor and its customers 
in periods of rising demand for offshore rigs  contractors typically prefer well to well contracts that allow contractors to profit from increasing dayrates 
in contrast  during these periods customers with reasonably definite drilling programs typically prefer longer term contracts to maintain dayrate prices at a consistent level 
conversely  in periods of decreasing demand for offshore rigs  contractors generally prefer longer term contracts to preserve dayrates at existing levels and ensure utilization  while customers prefer well to well contracts that allow them to obtain the benefit of lower dayrates 
if possible  diamond offshore seeks to have a foundation of long term contracts with a reasonable balance of single well  well to well and short term contracts to minimize the downside impact of a decline in the market while still participating in the benefit of increasing dayrates in a rising market 
customers diamond offshore provides offshore drilling services to a customer base that includes major and independent oil and gas companies and government owned oil companies 
several customers have accounted for or more of diamond offshore s annual consolidated revenues  although the specific customers may vary from year to year 
during  diamond offshore performed services for different customers with bp  petrobraspetroleo brasileiro sa petrobras and murphy exploration and production company accounting for  and of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues  respectively 
during  diamond offshore performed services for different customers with bp and petrobras accounting for and of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues  respectively 
during  diamond offshore performed services for approximately different customers with petrobras and bp accounting for and of diamond offshore s annual total consolidated revenues  respectively 
during periods of low demand for offshore drilling rigs  the loss of a single significant customer could have a material adverse effect on diamond offshore s results of operations 
competition the contract drilling industry is highly competitive and is influenced by a number of factors  including the current and anticipated prices of oil and natural gas  the expenditures by oil and gas companies for exploration and development of oil and natural gas and the availability of drilling rigs 
in addition  demand for drilling services remains dependent on a variety of political and economic factors beyond diamond offshore s control  including worldwide demand for oil and natural gas  the ability of the organization of petroleum exporting countries opec to set and maintain production levels and pricing  the level of production of non opec countries and the policies of the various governments regarding exploration and development of their oil and natural gas reserves 
customers often award contracts on a competitive bid basis  and although a customer selecting a rig may consider  among other things  a contractor s safety record  crew quality  rig location  and quality of service and equipment  the historical oversupply of rigs has created an intensely competitive market in which price is the primary factor in determining the selection of a drilling contractor 
in periods of increased drilling activity  rig availability has  in some cases  also become a consideration  particularly with respect to technologically advanced units 
diamond offshore believes that competition for drilling contracts will continue to be intense in the foreseeable future 
contractors are also able to adjust localized supply and demand imbalances by moving rigs from areas of low utilization and dayrates to areas of greater activity and relatively higher dayrates 
such movements  reactivations or a decrease in drilling activity in any major market could depress dayrates and could adversely affect utilization of diamond offshore s rigs 
governmental regulation diamond offshore s operations are subject to numerous federal  state and local laws and regulations that relate directly or indirectly to its operations  including certain regulations controlling the discharge of materials into the environment  requiring removal and clean up under certain circumstances  or otherwise relating to the protection of the environment 
for example  diamond offshore may be liable for damages and costs incurred in connection with oil spills for which it is held responsible 
laws and regulations protecting the environment have become increasingly stringent in recent years and may  in certain circumstances  impose strict liability rendering a company liable for environmental damage without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such company 
liability under such laws and regulations may result from either governmental or citizen prosecution 
such laws and regulations may expose diamond offshore to liability for the conduct of or conditions caused by others  or for acts of diamond offshore that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time such acts were performed 
the application of these requirements or the adoption of new requirements could have a material adverse effect on diamond offshore 
the united states oil pollution act of opak  and similar legislation enacted in texas  louisiana and other coastal states  addresses oil spill prevention and control and significantly expands liability exposure across all segments of the oil and gas industry 
opak  such similar legislation and related regulations impose a variety of obligations on diamond offshore related to the prevention of oil spills and liability for damages resulting from such spills 
opak imposes strict and  with limited exceptions  joint and several liability upon each responsible party for oil removal costs and a variety of public and private damages 
indemnification and insurance diamond offshore s operations are subject to hazards inherent in the drilling of oil and gas wells such as blowouts  reservoir damage  loss of production  loss of well control  cratering or fires  the occurrence of which could result in the suspension of drilling operations  injury to or death of rig and other personnel and damage to or destruction of diamond offshore s  diamond offshore s customers or a third party s property or equipment 
damage to the environment could also result from diamond offshore s operations  particularly through oil spillage or uncontrolled fires 
in addition  offshore drilling operations are subject to perils peculiar to marine operations  including capsizing  grounding  collision and loss or damage from severe weather 
diamond offshore has insurance coverage and contractual indemnification for certain risks  but there can be no assurance that such coverage or indemnification will adequately cover diamond offshore s loss or liability in many circumstances or that diamond offshore will continue to carry such insurance or receive such indemnification 
in december of  diamond offshore renewed its hull and machinery insurance policy 
diamond offshore s retention of liability for property damage increased at the time of renewal from approximately million per incident to between and million per incident  depending on the value of the equipment  with an aggregate annual deductible of million 
in addition  diamond offshore retained of its insured liability 
operations outside the united states operations outside the united states accounted for approximately  and of diamond offshore s total consolidated revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively 
diamond offshore s non us operations are subject to certain political  economic and other uncertainties not encountered in us operations  including risks of war and civil disturbances or other risks that may limit or disrupt markets  expropriation and the general hazards associated with the assertion of national sovereignty over certain areas in which operations are conducted 
no prediction can be made as to what governmental regulations may be enacted in the future that could adversely affect the international drilling industry 
diamond offshore s operations outside the united states may also face the additional risk of fluctuating currency values  hard currency shortages  controls of currency exchange and repatriation of income or capital

cna s historical accounting was to record an asset for the amount paid to acquire the life settlement contract along with other direct acquisition costs  and to recognize revenue over the period the contract was held 
the sec concluded that the financial accounting standards board fasb technical bulletin ftb accounting for purchases of life insurance should have been applied to cna s investment in life settlement contracts 
under ftb  the carrying value of each contract at purchase and at the end of each reporting period is equal to the cash surrender value of the policy

as of december   the outstanding carolina group stock represents a economic interest in the economic performance of the carolina group 
the loews group consists of all the company s assets and liabilities other than the economic interest represented by the outstanding carolina group stock  and includes as an asset the notional  intergroup debt of the carolina group 
the existence of separate classes of common stock could give rise to occasions where the interests of the holders of loews common stock and carolina group stock diverge or conflict or appear to diverge or conflict 
subject to its fiduciary duties  the company s board of directors could  in its sole discretion  from time to time  make determinations or implement policies that affect disproportionately the groups or the different classes of stock 
for example  loews s board of directors may decide to reallocate assets  liabilities  revenue  expenses and cash flows between groups  without the consent of shareholders 
the board of directors would not be required to select the option that would result in the highest value for holders of carolina group stock 
as a result of the flexibility provided to loews s board of directors  it might be difficult for investors to assess the future prospects of the carolina group based on the carolina group s past performance 
the creation of the carolina group and the issuance of carolina group stock does not change the company s ownership of lorillard  inc or lorillard  inc s status as a separate legal entity 
the carolina group and the loews group are notional groups that are intended to reflect the performance of the defined sets of assets and liabilities of each such group as described above

at december   the book value per share of loews common stock was  compared to at december  the increase in book value per share of loews common stock is primarily due to proceeds from the issuance of the carolina group stock in february and the net economic interest attributable to the loews common stock in the notional intergroup debt receivable from the carolina group  net income for and an increase in the company s unrealized gains on available for sale investments 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with gaap  applied on a consistent basis 
the company continually evaluates the accounting policies and estimates used to prepare the consolidated financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  evaluation of current trends  information from third party professionals and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the known facts and circumstances 
the accounting policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of the company s financial statements as their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment 
due to the inherent uncertainties involved with this type of judgment  actual results could differ significantly from estimates and have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or equity 
insurance reserves insurance reserves are established for both short and long duration insurance contracts 
short duration contracts are primarily related to property and casualty policies where the reserving process is based on actuarial estimates of the amount of loss  including amounts for known and unknown claims 
long duration contracts typically include traditional life insurance and long term care products and are estimated using actuarial estimates about mortality and morbidity as well as assumptions about expected investment returns 
the inherent risks associated with the reserving process are discussed below  in reserves estimates and uncertainties 
additionally  a review of results of operations for cna s segment results  environmental pollution and mass tort and asbestos reserves and second quarter reserve strengthening sections that follow is necessary to understand the sensitivity of management s estimate 
reinsurance amounts recoverable from reinsurers are estimated in a manner consistent with claim and claim adjustment expense reserves or future policy benefits reserves and are reported as a receivable in the consolidated balance sheets 
the cost of reinsurance related to long duration contracts is accounted for over the life of the underlying reinsured policies using assumptions consistent with those used to account for the underlying policies 
the ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary liability of cna 
an estimated allowance for doubtful accounts is recorded on the basis of periodic evaluations of balances due from reinsurers  reinsurer solvency  management s experience and current economic conditions 
further information on reinsurance is provided in the reinsurance section that follows 
tobacco litigation lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation 
plaintiffs in most of the cases seek unspecified amounts of compensatory damages and punitive damages  although some seek damages ranging into the billions of dollars 
plaintiffs in some of the cases seek treble damages  statutory damages  disgorgement of profits  equitable and injunctive relief  and medical monitoring  among other damages 
on july   the jury in engle v 
rj reynolds tobacco co  et al 
awarded a total of billion in punitive damages against all defendants  including billion against lorillard 
the judgment also provides that the jury s awards bear interest at the rate of per year 
lorillard remains of the view that the engle case should not have been certified as a class action 
lorillard believes that class certification in the engle case is inconsistent with the majority of federal and state court decisions which have held that mass smoking and health claims are inappropriate for class treatment 
lorillard has challenged the class certification  as well as numerous other legal errors that it believes occurred during the trial 
the florida third district court of appeal heard argument in defendants appeal on november  the court of appeal took the appeal under advisement 
the company and lorillard believe that an appeal of these issues on the merits should prevail 
lorillard believes that it has valid defenses to the cases pending against it 
lorillard also believes it has valid bases for appeal of the adverse verdicts against it 
to the extent the company is a defendant in any of the lawsuits  the company believes that it is not a proper defendant in these matters and has moved or plans to move for dismissal of all such claims against it 
while lorillard intends to defend vigorously all tobacco products liability litigation  it is not possible to predict the outcome of any of this litigation 
litigation is subject to many uncertainties  and it is possible that some of these actions could be decided unfavorably 
lorillard may enter into discussions in an attempt to settle particular cases if it believes it is appropriate to do so 
except for the impact of the state settlement agreements as described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this report  management is unable to make a meaningful estimate of the amount or range of loss that could result from an unfavorable outcome of pending litigation and  therefore  no provision has been made in the consolidated financial statements for any unfavorable outcome 
it is possible that the company s results of operations  cash flows and its financial position could be materially affected by an unfavorable outcome of certain pending litigation

cna conducts its operations through five operating groups standard lines  specialty lines and cna re these groups comprise the company s property and casualty segment  group operations and life operations 
in addition to these five operating segments  certain other activities are reported in the other insurance segment 
the other insurance segment consists of losses and expenses related to centralized adjusting and settlement of asbestos  pollution and mass tort claims apmt  certain run off insurance operations  interest expense on corporate debt  e business initiatives  and intercompany eliminations 
these segments reflect the way cna manages its operations and makes business decisions 
run off insurance operations consist of personal insurance  entertainment insurance  agriculture insurance  group reinsurance and other financial lines as well as the direct financial guarantee business underwritten by cna s insurance affiliates and other insurance run off operations 
run off insurance operations also include assumed business underwritten through a managing general agent  ioa global  which consists primarily of certain accident and health coverages igi program 
during  cna underwent management changes and strategic realignment 
these events have changed the way cna manages its operations and makes business decisions and  therefore  necessitated a change in cna s reportable segments 
cna trust  a limited operations bank specializing in k plan administration  and institutional markets  which provides guaranteed return investment products for qualified and non qualified institutional buyers  was transferred from life operations to group operations 
group reinsurance  the business which assumes reinsurance from unaffiliated entities on group life  accident and health products and excess medical risk coverages for self funded employers  was transferred from group operations to other insurance to be included as part of run off insurance operations 
the environmental pollution and mass tort and asbestos apmt reserves related to assumed reinsurance  along with the assumed business underwritten through a managing general agent  ioa global  which consists primarily of certain accident and health coverages  was transferred from cna re to other insurance 
the us zone of global business  which primarily offers international insurance to us based corporations and us insurance to foreign corporations  was transferred from specialty lines to standard lines 
the consolidated operations for the year ended december  were significantly impacted by the second quarter prior year reserve strengthening  wtc event  and restructuring and other related charges 
a discussion of these items  along with cna s current terrorism exposure and description of reserves is presented below 
world trade center event during the third quarter of  cna recorded estimated incurred losses of million pretax  net of reinsurance  related to the world trade center disaster and related events wtc event 
the loss estimate was based on a total industry loss of billion and included all lines of insurance 
this estimate took into account cna s substantial reinsurance agreements  including its catastrophe reinsurance program and corporate reinsurance programs 
cna has closely monitored reported losses as well as the collection of reinsurance on wtc event claims 
as of december   cna believes its recorded reserves  net of reinsurance  for the wtc event are adequate

second quarter prior year reserve strengthening during the second quarter of  cna noted the continued emergence of adverse loss experience across several lines of business related to prior years  which are discussed in further detail below 
cna completed a number of reserve studies during the second quarter of for many of its lines of business  including those in which these adverse trends were noted 
the second quarter prior year reserve strengthening and related items comprising the amounts noted above are detailed by segment in the following table standard specialty other year ended december  lines lines cna re insurance total in millions net reserve strengthening excluding the impact of the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty apmt   non apmt  total   pretax benefit from corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty on accident year accrual for insurance related assessments net reserve strengthening and related accruals   change in estimate of premium accruals reduction of related commission accruals net premium and related accrual reductions total pretax second quarter reserve strengthening and other related accruals   total after tax and minority interest second quarter reserve strengthening and other related accruals  of ceded losses reduced by of ceded premiums and of interest charges 
with respect to environmental and mass tort reserves  commencing in and continuing into the first and second quarters of  cna received a number of new reported claims  some of which involved declaratory judgment actions premised on court decisions purporting to expand insurance coverage for pollution claims 
in these decisions  several courts adopted rules of insurance policy interpretation which established joint and several liability for insurers consecutively on a risk during a period of alleged property damage  and in other instances adopted interpretations of the absolute pollution exclusion  which weakened its effectiveness in most circumstances 
in addition to receiving new claims and declaratory judgment actions premised upon these unfavorable legal precedents  these court decisions also impacted cna s pending pollution and mass tort claims and coverage litigation 
during the spring of  cna reviewed specific claims and litigation  as well as general trends  and concluded reserve strengthening in this area was necessary 
in the area of mass torts  several well publicized verdicts arising out of bodily injury cases related to allegedly toxic mold led to a significant increase in mold related claims in and the first half of cna s reserve increase in the second quarter of was caused in part by this increased area of exposure 
with respect to other court cases and how they might affect cna s reserves and reasonable possible losses  the following should be noted 
state and federal courts issue numerous decisions each year  which potentially impact losses and reserves in both a favorable and unfavorable manner 
examples of favorable developments include decisions to allocate defense and indemnity payments in a manner so as to limit carriers obligations to damages taking place during the effective dates of their policies  decisions holding that injuries occurring after asbestos operations are completed are subject to the completed operations aggregate limits of the policies  and decisions ruling that carriers loss control inspections of their insured s premises do not give rise to a duty to warn third parties to the dangers of asbestos 
examples of unfavorable developments include decisions limiting the application of the absolute pollution exclusion  and decisions holding carriers liable for defense and indemnity of asbestos and pollution claims on a joint and several basis 
throughout and into  cna experienced significant increases in new asbestos bodily injury claims 
in light of this development  cna formed the view that payments for asbestos claims could be higher in future years than previously estimated 
moreover  in late through mid  industry sources such as rating agencies and actuarial firms released analyses and studies commenting on the increase in claim volumes and other asbestos liability developments 
for example  am best company am best released a study in may increasing its ultimate asbestos reserve estimate from to billion  citing an unfunded insurance industry reserve shortfall of billion 
in june  tillinghast raised its asbestos ultimate exposure from to billion for the insurance industry and its estimate of the ultimate remaining asbestos liability for all industries was raised to billion 
also in the to time period  a number of significant asbestos defendants filed for bankruptcy  increasing the likelihood that excess layers of insurance coverage could be called upon to indemnify policyholders and creating the potential that novel legal doctrines could be employed  which could accelerate the time when such indemnification payments could be due 
these developments led cna to the conclusion that its asbestos reserves required strengthening 
the non apmt adverse reserve development in was the result of analyses of several lines of business 
this development related principally to commercial insurance coverages including automobile liability and multiple peril  as well as assumed reinsurance and healthcare related coverages 
a brief summary of these lines of business and the associated reserve development is discussed below 
approximately million of the adverse loss development was a result of several coverages provided to commercial entities 
the gross and net carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for standard lines at the beginning of was  and  million 
reserve analyses performed during showed unexpected increases in the size of claims for several lines  including commercial automobile liability  general liability and the liability portion of commercial multiple peril coverages 
in addition  the number of commercial automobile liability claims was higher than expected and several state specific factors resulted in higher than anticipated losses  including developments associated with commercial automobile liability coverage in ohio and general liability coverage provided to contractors in new york 
the unfavorable development was driven principally by accident years through the remaining development affecting years prior to was driven principally by construction defect claims as described below 
the commercial automobile liability analysis indicated increased ultimate claim and claim adjustment expense across several accident years due to higher paid and reported claim and claim adjustment expense resulting from several factors 
these factors include uninsured underinsured motorists coverage in ohio  a change in the rate at which the average claim size was increasing and a lack of improvement in the ratio of the number of claims per exposure unit  the frequency 
first  ohio courts had significantly broadened the population covered through the uninsured underinsured motorists coverage 
the broadening of the population covered by this portion of the policy  and the retrospective nature of this broadening of coverage  resulted in additional claims for older years 
second  in recent years  the average claim size had been increasing at less than a annual rate 
the available data indicated that the rate of increase was closer to with only a portion of this increase explainable by a change in mix of business 
finally  the review completed during the second quarter of indicated that the frequency for the accident year was higher than expectations were that the frequency would show an improvement from the level 
the analyses of general liability and the liability portion of commercial multiple peril coverages showed several factors affecting these lines 
construction defect claims in california and a limited number of other states have had a significant impact 
it was expected that the number of claims being reported and the average size of those claims would fall quickly due to the decrease in business exposed to those losses 
however  the number of claims reported during the first six months of increased from the number of claims reported during the last six months of in addition to the effects of construction defect claims  the average claim associated with new york labor law has risen to more than  from less than  which was significantly greater than previously expected 
an analysis of assumed reinsurance business written by cna re showed that the paid and reported losses for recent accident years were higher than expectations  which resulted in management recording net unfavorable development on prior year loss reserves of approximately million 
the gross and net claim and claim adjustment expense reserves at the beginning of for cna re was  and  million 
because of the long and variable reporting pattern associated with assumed reinsurance as well as uncertainty regarding possible changes in the reporting methods of the ceding companies  the carried reserves for assumed reinsurance was based mainly on the pricing assumptions until experience emerges to show that the pricing assumptions are no longer valid 
the reviews completed during the second quarter of  including analysis at the individual treaty level  showed that the pricing assumptions were no longer appropriate 
the classes of business with the most significant changes included excess of loss liability  professional liability and proportional and retrocessional property 
the unfavorable reserve development was driven principally by accident years through approximately million of adverse loss development was due to adverse experience in all other lines  primarily in coverages provided to healthcare related entities written by cna healthpro 
the gross and net claim and claim adjustment expense reserves at the beginning of for specialty lines was approximately  and  million 
the level of paid and reported losses associated with coverages provided to national long term care facilities were higher than expected 
the long term care facility business had traditionally been limited to local facilities 
in recent years  cna began to provide coverage to large chains of long term care facilities 
original assumptions were that these chains would exhibit loss ratios similar to the local facilities 
the most recent review of these large chains indicated an overall loss ratio in excess of versus approximately for the remaining business 
in addition  the average size of claims resulting from coverages provided to physicians and institutions providing healthcare related services increased more than expected 
the review indicated that the average loss had increased to over  prior to this review  the expectation for the average loss was approximately  unfavorable reserve development of million was recorded for accident years through the remaining unfavorable reserve development was attributable to accident years prior to concurrent with cna s review of loss reserves  cna completed comprehensive studies of estimated premium receivable accruals on retrospectively rated insurance policies and involuntary market facilities 
these studies included ground up reviews of retrospective premium accruals utilizing a more comprehensive database of retrospectively rated contracts 
this review included application of the policy retrospective rating parameters to the revised estimate of ultimate loss ratio and consideration of actual interim cash settlement 
this study resulted in a change in the estimated retrospective premiums receivable balances 
as a result of this review and changes in premiums associated with the change in estimates for loss reserves  cna recorded a pretax reduction in premium accruals of million 
the effect on net earned premiums was million offset by a reduction of accrued commissions of million 
the studies included the review of all such retrospectively rated insurance policies and the estimate of ultimate losses 
approximately million of this amount resulted from a change in estimate in premiums related to involuntary market facilities  which had an offsetting impact on net losses and therefore had no impact on the net operating results 
more than one half of the change in estimate in premiums was attributable to accident years through with the remainder attributable to years prior to accruals for ceded premiums related to other reinsurance treaties increased million due to the reserve strengthening 
this increase in accruals for ceded premiums were principally recorded in accident year the remainder of the decrease in premium accruals relates to the change in estimate of the amount of retrospective premium receivables as discussed above  which were principally recorded in accident years prior to reinsurance cna assumes and cedes reinsurance with other insurers  reinsurers and members of various reinsurance pools and associations 
cna utilizes reinsurance arrangements to limit its maximum loss  provide greater diversification of risk  minimize exposures on larger risks and to exit certain lines of business 
reinsurance coverages are tailored to the specific risk characteristics of each product line and cna s retained amount varies by type of coverage 
generally  property risks are reinsured on an excess of loss  per risk basis 
liability coverages are generally reinsured on a quota share basis in excess of cna s retained risk 
cna s ceded life reinsurance includes utilization of coinsurance  yearly renewable term and facultative programs 
a majority of the reinsurance utilized by cna s life insurance operations relates to term life insurance policies 
term life insurance policies issued from onward are generally ceded at of the face value 
universal life policies issued from onward are generally ceded at of the face value 
cna s overall reinsurance program includes certain property and casualty contracts  such as the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties discussed in more detail later in this section  that are entered into and accounted for on a funds withheld basis 
under the funds withheld basis  cna records the cash remitted to the reinsurer for the reinsurer s margin  or cost of the reinsurance contract  as ceded premiums 
the remainder of the premiums ceded under the reinsurance contract is recorded as funds withheld liabilities 
cna is required to increase the funds withheld balance at stated interest crediting rates applied to the funds withheld balance or as otherwise specified under the terms of the contract 
the funds withheld liability is reduced by any cumulative claim payments made by cna in excess of cna s retention under the reinsurance contract 
if the funds withheld liability is exhausted  interest crediting will cease and additional claim payments are recoverable from the reinsurer 
the funds withheld liability is recorded in reinsurance balances payable in the consolidated balance sheets 
interest cost on these contracts is credited during all periods in which a funds withheld liability exists 
interest cost  which is included in investment income  net was  and million in  and the amount subject to interest crediting rates on such contracts was  and  million at december  and the amount subject to interest crediting on these funds withheld contracts will vary over time based on a number of factors  including the timing of loss payments and ultimate gross losses incurred 
cna expects that it will continue to incur significant interest costs on these contracts for several years 
the ceding of insurance does not discharge the primary liability of cna 
therefore  a credit exposure exists with respect to property and casualty and life reinsurance ceded to the extent that any reinsurer is unable to meet the obligations assumed under reinsurance agreements 
amounts receivable from reinsurers were  and  million at december  and of these amounts  and million were billed to reinsurers as of december  and  as reinsurance contracts generally require payment of claims by the ceding company before the amount can be billed to the reinsurer 
the remaining receivable relates to the estimated case and incurred but not reported losses ibnr reserves and future policyholder benefits ceded under reinsurance contracts 
cna attempts to mitigate its credit risk related to reinsurance by entering into reinsurance arrangements only with reinsurers that have credit ratings above certain levels and by obtaining substantial amounts of collateral 
the primary methods of obtaining collateral are through reinsurance trusts  letters of credit and funds withheld balances 
such collateral was approximately  and  million at december  and cna s largest recoverables from a single reinsurer at december   including prepaid reinsurance premiums  were approximately      and million from subsidiaries of allstate  subsidiaries of hannover reinsurance ireland ltd  american reinsurance company  european reinsurance company of zurich  subsidiaries of gerling global reinsurance corporation  and lloyd s underwriters 
cna has reinsurance receivables from several reinsurers who have recently experienced multiple downgrades of their financial strength ratings  have announced that they will no longer accept new business and are placing their books of business into run off 
cna s principal credit exposures from these recent events arise from reinsurance receivables from gerling global gerling  trenwick and commercial risk insurance groups 
at december   cna had approximately million of reinsurance receivables from these reinsurers  of which million was not supported by collateral 
the majority of the uncollateralized receivables were due from us domiciled insurers 
of the million of reinsurance recoverables unsupported by collateral  million relates to gerling 
gerling has stated that cna transfer approximately million of funds withheld balances on three treaties relating to cna healthpro to a trust established by gerling for the benefit of cna  or in the absence of such transfer  that these treaties be commuted 
cna has taken gerling s statement under advisement 
in certain circumstances  including significant deterioration of a reinsurer s financial strength ratings  cna may engage in commutation discussions with an individual reinsurer 
the outcome of such discussions may result in a lump sum settlement that is less than the recorded receivable  net of any applicable allowance for doubtful accounts 
losses arising from commutations  including any related to gerling  could have an adverse material impact on the company s results of operations or equity 
cna has established an allowance for doubtful accounts to provide for estimated uncollectible reinsurance receivables 
the allowance for doubtful accounts was and million at december  and while cna believes the allowance for doubtful accounts is adequate based on current collateral and information currently available  failure of reinsurers to meet their obligations could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or equity 
for  cna entered into a corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty covering substantially all of cna s property and casualty lines of business the cover 
ceded premium related to the reinsurer s margin of million was recorded in no losses were ceded during under this contract  and the cover was commuted as of december  in  cna entered into an aggregate reinsurance treaty related to the through accident years covering substantially all of cna s property and casualty lines of business the aggregate cover 
cna has two sections of coverage under the terms of the aggregate cover 
these coverages attach at defined loss ratios for each accident year 
coverage under the first section of the aggregate cover  which is available for all accident years covered by the contract  has annual limits of million of ceded losses with an aggregate limit of billion of ceded losses for the three year period 
the ceded premiums are a percentage of ceded losses and for each million of limit the ceded premium is million 
the second section of the aggregate cover  which was only utilized for accident year  provides additional coverage of up to million of ceded losses for a maximum ceded premium of million 
under the aggregate cover  interest charges on the funds withheld liability accrue at per annum 
if the aggregate loss ratio for the three year period exceeds certain thresholds  additional premiums may be payable and the rate at which interest charges are accrued would increase to per annum commencing in the coverage under the second section of the aggregate cover was triggered for the accident year 
as a result of losses related to the wtc event  the limit under this section was exhausted 
additionally  as a result of the significant reserve additions recorded in the second quarter of  the million limit on the accident year under the first section was also fully utilized 
no losses have been ceded to the remaining million of aggregate limit on accident years and under the first section of the aggregate cover 
the impact of the aggregate cover on pretax operating results was as follows year ended december in millions ceded earned premium ceded claim and claim adjustment expenses  interest charges pretax expense benefit on operating results in  cna entered into a one year aggregate reinsurance treaty related to the accident year covering substantially all property and casualty lines of business in the continental casualty company pool the ccc cover 
the loss protection provided by the ccc cover has an aggregate limit of approximately million of ceded losses 
the ceded premiums are a percentage of ceded losses 
the ceded premium related to full utilization of the million of limit is million 
the ccc cover provides continuous coverage in excess of the second section of the aggregate cover discussed above 
under the ccc cover  interest charges on the funds withheld generally accrue at per annum 
the interest rate increases to per annum if the aggregate loss ratio exceeds certain thresholds

the first plan related to cna s information technology operations the it plan 
the second plan related to restructuring the property and casualty segments and life operations  discontinuation of the variable life and annuity business and consolidation of real estate locations the plan 
it plan the overall goal of the it plan was to improve technology for the underwriting function and throughout cna and to eliminate inefficiencies in the deployment of it resources 
the changes facilitated a strong focus on enterprise wide system initiatives 
the it plan had two main components  which included the reorganization of it resources into the technology and operations group with a structure based on centralized  functional roles and the implementation of an integrated technology roadmap that included common architecture and platform standards that directly support cna s strategies

the major components of the plan included a reduction in the number of strategic business units sbus in the property and casualty operations  changes in the strategic focus of the life operations and group operations and consolidation of real estate locations 
the reduction in the number of property and casualty sbus resulted in consolidation of sbu functions  including underwriting  claims  marketing and finance

reserves estimates and uncertainties cna maintains reserves to cover its estimated ultimate unpaid liability for claim and claim adjustment expenses and future policy benefits  including the estimated cost of the claims adjudication process  for claims that have been reported but not yet settled and claims that have been incurred but not reported 
claim and claim adjustment expense and future policy benefit reserves are reflected as liabilities on the consolidated balance sheets under the heading insurance reserves 
changes in estimates of insurance reserves are reflected in the company s consolidated statements of operations  in the period in which the change arises 
the level of insurance reserves maintained by cna represents management s best estimate  as of a particular point in time  of what the ultimate settlement and administration of claims will cost based on its assessment of facts and circumstances known at that time 
insurance reserves are not an exact calculation of liability but instead are estimates that are derived by cna  generally utilizing a variety of actuarial reserve estimation techniques  from numerous assumptions and expectations about future events  both internal and external  many of which are highly uncertain 
some of the many uncertain future events about which cna makes assumptions and estimates are claims severity  frequency of claims  mortality  morbidity  expected interest rates  economic inflation  the impact of underwriting policy and claims handling practices and the lag time between the occurrence of an insured event and the time it is ultimately settled referred to in the insurance industry as the tail 
cna s experience has been that the inherent uncertainties of estimating insurance reserves are generally greater for casualty coverages particularly long tail casualty risks such as apmt losses than for property coverages 
estimates of the cost of future apmt claims are highly complex and include an assessment of  among other things  whether certain costs are covered under the policies and whether recovery limits apply  allocation of liability among numerous parties  some of whom are in bankruptcy proceedings  inconsistent court decisions and developing legal theories and tactics of plaintiffs lawyers 
reserves for property related catastrophes  both natural disasters and man made catastrophes such as terrorist acts  are also difficult to estimate 
see the discussion of the second quarter prior year reserve strengthening  the wtc event  and environmental pollution and mass tort and asbestos reserves for further information 
in addition to the uncertainties inherent in estimating apmt and catastrophe losses  cna is subject to the uncertain effects of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues  which arise as industry practices and legal  judicial  social  and other environmental conditions change 
these issues can have a negative effect on cna s business by either extending coverage beyond the original underwriting intent or by increasing the number or size of claims 
either development could require material increases in claim and claim adjustment expense reserves 
examples of emerging or potential claims and coverage issues include i increases in the number and size of water damage claims related to expenses for testing and remediation of mold conditions  ii increases in the number and size of claims relating to injuries from medical products  and exposure to lead and radiation related to cellular phone usage  iii expected increases in the number and size of claims relating to accounting and financial reporting  including director and officer and errors and omissions insurance claims  in an environment of major corporate bankruptcies  and iv a growing trend of plaintiffs targeting insurers in class action litigation relating to claims handling and other practices 
the future impact of these and other unforeseen emerging or potential claims and coverage issues is extremely hard to predict and could materially adversely affect the adequacy of cna s claim and claim adjustment expense reserves and could lead to future reserve additions 
cna s current insurance reserve levels reflect management s best estimate of cna s ultimate claims and claim adjustment expenses and future policy benefits at december   based upon known facts and current law 
however  in light of the many uncertainties associated with making the estimates and assumptions necessary to establish reserve levels  cna reviews its reserve estimates on a regular and ongoing basis and makes changes as experience develops 
cna may in the future determine that its recorded insurance reserves are not sufficient and may increase its reserves by amounts that may be material  which could materially adversely affect the company s business and financial condition 
any such increase in reserves would be recorded as a charge against the company s earnings for the period in which the change in estimate arises 
the following table presents estimated volatility in carried claim and claim adjustment loss reserves for the property and casualty segments 
gross estimated carried loss volatility in december  reserves reserves in millions  except standard lines  specialty lines  cna re  other insurance  the estimated volatility noted above does not represent a range around the actuarial point estimate of cna s gross loss reserves  and it does not represent the range of all possible outcomes 
the volatility represents an estimate of the inherent volatility associated with estimating loss reserves for the specific type of business written by each segment 
the primary characteristics influencing the estimated level of volatility are the length of the claim settlement period  changes in medical and other claim costs  changes in the level of litigation or other dispute resolution processes  changes in the legal environment and the potential for different types of injuries emerging 
ceded reinsurance arrangements may reduce the volatility 
since ceded reinsurance arrangements vary by year  volatility in gross reserves may not result in comparable impacts to underwriting income or equity 
cna s insurance loss reserves are recorded at management s best estimate which is based on the reviews and analyses performed by cna s actuaries and management s judgment as to the responsiveness of these reviews and analyses to the factors affecting cna s loss and loss adjustment expense loss reserves 
management considers factors such as changes in inflation  changes in claim handling and case reserving  changes in underwriting and pricing  and changes in the legal environment 
management considers different specific factors for each situation since the factors affect each type of business differently 
terrorism exposure cna and the insurance industry incurred substantial losses related to the wtc event 
for the most part  cna believes the industry was able to absorb the loss of capital from these losses  but the capacity to withstand the effect of any additional terrorism events was significantly diminished 
on november   the president of the united states of america signed into law the terrorism risk insurance act of the act  which establishes a program within the department of the treasury under which the federal government will share the risk of loss from future terrorist attacks with the insurance industry 
the act terminates on december  each participating insurance company must pay a deductible before federal government assistance becomes available 
this deductible is based on a percentage of direct earned premiums for commercial insurance lines from the previous calendar year  and rises from from date of enactment to december  the transition period to during the first subsequent calendar year  in year two and in year three 
for losses in excess of a company s deductible  the federal government will cover of the excess losses  while companies retain the remaining 
losses covered by the program will be capped annually at billion  above this amount  insurers are not liable for covered losses and congress is to determine the procedures for and the source of any payments 
amounts paid by the federal government under the program over certain phased limits are to be recouped by the department of the treasury through policy surcharges  which cannot exceed of annual premium 
insurance companies providing commercial property and casualty insurance are required to participate in the program  but it does not cover life or health insurance products 
state law limitations applying to premiums and policies for terrorism coverage are not generally affected under the program  but they are pre empted in relation to prior approval requirements for rates and forms 
the act has policyholder notice requirements in order for insurers to be reimbursed for terrorism related losses and  from the date of enactment until december   a mandatory offer requirement for terrorism coverage  although it may be rejected by insureds 
the secretary of the department of the treasury has discretion to extend this offer requirement until december while the act provides the property and casualty industry with an increased ability to withstand the effect of a terrorist event during the next three years  given the unpredictability of the nature  targets  severity or frequency of potential terrorist events  cna s results of operations or equity could nevertheless be materially adversely impacted by them 
cna is attempting to mitigate this exposure through its underwriting practices  policy terms and conditions where applicable and the use of reinsurance 
in addition  under state laws  cna is generally prohibited from excluding terrorism exposure from its primary workers compensation  individual life and group life and health policies  and is also prohibited from excluding coverage for fire losses following a terrorist event in a number of states 
reinsurers obligations for terrorism related losses under reinsurance agreements are not covered by the act 
cna s current reinsurance arrangements either exclude terrorism coverage or significantly limit the level of coverage 
property and casualty cna conducts its property and casualty operations through the following operating segments standard lines  specialty lines  and cna re 
the discussion of underwriting results and ratios reflect the underlying business results of cna s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries 
underwriting ratios are industry measures of property and casualty underwriting results 
the loss ratio is the percentage of net incurred claim and claim adjustment expenses to net earned premiums 
the expense ratio is the percentage of underwriting and acquisition expenses  including the amortization of deferred acquisition costs  to net earned premiums 
the dividend ratio is the ratio of dividends incurred to net earned premiums 
the following table summarizes key components of the property and casualty segment operating results for the years ended december   and year ended december in millions  except net written premiums    net earned premiums    underwriting loss  investment income  net  net operating income loss  ratios loss and loss adjustment expense expense dividend combined adjusted underwriting loss adjusted ratios loss and loss adjustment expense expense dividend combined the adjusted underwriting loss and adjusted ratios exclude the impact of the second quarter reserve strengthening  the wtc event  both net of the related benefit of corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties  and restructuring and other related charges 
compared with net operating income for the property and casualty segment was million in as compared with a net operating loss of  million in the operating results include prior year reserve strengthening of  million recorded in the second quarter of related to a change in estimate of prior year net loss reserves and retrospective premium accruals  net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty benefit  estimated losses related to the wtc event of million  net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties benefit  and restructuring and other related charges of million recorded in excluding these significant items  net operating results increased million 
this increase was due primarily to improved underwriting results and a reduction in the accrual for restructuring and other related charges of million after tax and minority interest 
the operating results include a million charge  after tax and minority interest  to strengthen prior underwriting year loss reserves for cna re uk  unfavorable underwriting results for the london based primary commercial and marine operations  million related to the bankruptcy filing by certain enron entities and million benefit related to core corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties 
partially offsetting these improvements was a decline in investment income  including a million decrease in limited partnership income 
the combined ratio decreased points in as compared with and the underwriting results for the property and casualty segment improved million 
this change was due to decreases in the loss expense and dividend ratios 
the loss ratio decreased points as a result of improved current accident year results related to rate increases and new business across property and casualty operations and favorable prior year reserve development in standard lines in partially offsetting these improvements was unfavorable prior year reserve development in specialty lines and cna re recorded in the property and casualty segment recorded million of unfavorable reserve development in as compared with million of unfavorable reserve development in the gross carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was  and  million for the years ended december  and the net carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was  and  million for the years ended december  and specialty lines recorded unfavorable prior year reserve development of approximately million for cna healthpro in  which was driven principally by medical malpractice excess products provided to hospitals and physicians and coverages provided to long term care facilities  principally national for profit nursing homes 
approximately million of the prior year unfavorable reserve development was related to assumed excess products and loss portfolio transfers  and was primarily driven by unexpected increases in the number of excess claims in accident years and the percentage of total claims greater than million has increased by  from less than of all claims to more than of all claims 
cna healthpro no longer writes assumed excess products and loss portfolio transfers 
approximately million of the prior year unfavorable reserve development was related to long term care facilities 
the development was principally recorded for accident years through the average value of claims closed during the first several months of increased by more than when compared to claims closed during in response to those trends  cna healthpro has reduced its writings of national for profit nursing home chains 
excess products provided to healthcare institutions and physician coverages in a limited number of states were responsible for the remaining development in cna healthpro 
the unfavorable reserve development on excess products provided to institutions for accident years through resulted from increases in the size of claims experienced by these institutions 
due to the increase in the size of claims  more claims were exceeding the point at which these excess products apply 
the unfavorable reserve development on physician coverages was recorded for accident years through in oregon  california  arizona and nevada 
the average claim size in these states has increased by  driving the change in losses 
the marine business recorded unfavorable reserve development of approximately million during approximately million of this unfavorable reserve development was due to participation in voluntary pools 
about half of the reserve development was recorded in accident years and with the remainder attributable to accident years prior to the reserves were based on recommendations provided by the pools 
participation in many of these pools has been discontinued 
the remaining reserve development for the marine business was due principally to unfavorable reserve development on hull and liability coverages from accident years and offset by favorable reserve development on cargo coverages recorded for accident year reviews completed during showed additional reported losses on individual large accounts and other bluewater business that drove the unfavorable hull and liability reserve development 
these additional losses during for accident years and were almost higher than the provision that had been established at the end of offsetting the unfavorable reserve development was favorable development in cna pro and for enron related exposures 
programs providing professional liability coverage to accountants  lawyers and realtors primarily drove favorable prior year reserve development of approximately million in cna pro 
reviews of this business completed during have shown little activity for older accident years principally prior to  which reduced the need for reserves on these years 
the reported losses on these programs for accident years prior to increased by approximately million during this increase compared to the total reserve at the beginning of of approximately million  net of reinsurance 
additionally  favorable reserve development of million was associated with the enron settlement 
cna had established a million reserve for accident year for an excess layer associated with enron related surety losses  however  the case has settled for less than the attachment point of this excess layer 
also recorded in was reserve strengthening for the london based commercial and marine operations and losses related to enron entities as discussed above 
cna re recorded prior year reserve strengthening as a result of an actuarial review completed during and was primarily recorded in the directors and officers  professional liability errors and omissions  and surety lines of business 
several large losses  as well as continued increases in the overall average size of claims for these lines  have resulted in higher than expected loss ratios 
standard lines recorded approximately million of favorable prior year reserve development attributable to participation in the workers compensation reinsurance bureau wcrb  a reinsurance pool  and residual market 
the favorable prior year reserve development for wcrb was the result of information received from the wcrb that reported the results of a recent actuarial review 
this information indicated that cna s net required reserves for accident years through were million less than the carried reserves 
in addition  during  cna commuted accident years through for a payment of approximately million to cover carried reserves of approximately million  resulting in further favorable reserve development of million 
the favorable residual market prior year reserve development was the result of lower than expected paid loss activity during recent periods for accident years dating back to the paid losses during on prior accident years were approximately of the previously expected amount 
in addition  standard lines had favorable prior year reserve development  primarily in the package liability and auto liability lines of business due to new claims initiatives 
these new claims initiatives  which included specialized training on specific areas of the claims adjudication process  enhanced claims litigation management  enhanced adjuster level metrics to monitor performance and more focused metric based claim file review and oversight  are expected to produce significant reductions in ultimate claim costs 
based on management s best estimate of the reduction in ultimate claim costs  approximately million of favorable prior year reserve development was recorded in approximately one half of this favorable reserve development was recorded in accident years prior to  with the remainder of the favorable reserve development recorded in accident years to additional favorable reserve development may be recorded in the future as management continues to monitor these estimates and as additional evidence becomes available to measure the effectiveness of the claim cost containment initiatives and management s corresponding estimate of such expected ultimate claim cost reductions 
while management believes that the estimate of ultimate claim cost reductions as a result of the claim cost containment initiatives is reasonable  there can be no assurance that the ultimate expected claim cost reductions will be achieved  or that any additional favorable development will be recorded as a result of the claim cost containment initiatives described above 
approximately million of favorable prior year reserve development during was recorded in commercial automobile liability 
most of the favorable development was from accident year the most recent actuarial review showed that underwriting actions have resulted in reducing the number of commercial automobile liability claims for recent accident years  especially the number of large losses 
approximately million of favorable reserve development was recorded in property lines during the favorable reserve development was principally from accident years through  and was the result of the low number of large losses in recent years 
although property claims are generally reported relatively quickly  determining the ultimate cost of the claim can involve a significant amount of time between the occurrence of the claim and settlement 
offsetting these favorable reserve developments were approximately million of unfavorable reserve development in middle market workers compensation  approximately million of unfavorable reserve development in programs written in cna e s  approximately million of unfavorable reserve development on a contractors account package policy program  and approximately million of unfavorable development on middle market general liability coverages 
the unfavorable reserve development on workers compensation was principally due to additional reinsurance premiums for accident years through a cna e s program covering facilities that provide services to developmentally disabled individuals  accounts for approximately million of the unfavorable reserve development 
the development is due to an increase in the size of known claims and increases in policyholder defense costs 
these increases became apparent as the result of a review completed during  with most of the development from accident years and the other program  which contributed to the cna e s development  covers tow truck and ambulance operators in the and accident years 
this program was started in cna expected that loss ratios for this business would be similar to its middle market commercial automobile liability business 
reviews completed during the year resulted in estimated loss ratios on the tow truck and ambulance business that are points higher than the middle market commercial automobile liability loss ratios 
the unfavorable reserve development on contractors account package policies was the result of an actuarial review completed during since this program is no longer being written  cna expected that the change in reported losses would decrease each quarterly period 
however  in recent quarterly periods  the change in reported losses has been higher than prior quarters  resulting in the unfavorable reserve development 
the expense ratio decreased points primarily as a result of reduced underwriting expenses resulting from decreased head count as a result of the plan and other expense reduction initiatives and an increase in the net earned premium base 
the dividend ratio decreased points due primarily to favorable current accident year dividends in standard lines 
net written premiums for the property and casualty segment increased  million for compared with included in net written premium was million of ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties  additional ceded premiums arising from both the reserve strengthening and wtc event  and a change in estimate for involuntary market premium accruals 
excluding these significant items  net written premium increased million primarily as a result of strong rate increases  increased new business and lower ceded premiums across the property and casualty segment 
net earned premiums for the property and casualty segment increased  million for compared with included in net earned premium was  million of ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties  additional ceded premiums arising from both the reserve strengthening and wtc event  and a change in estimate for involuntary market premium accruals 
excluding these significant items  net earned premium increased million due primarily to the increases in net written premiums noted above 
specialty lines achieved average rate increases of  and in  and for the contracts that renewed during these years and had retention rates of  and for those contracts that were up for renewal 
the retention rates above apply to specialty lines excluding the cna guaranty and credit  surety and warranty businesses 
standard lines achieved average rate increases of  and in  and for the contracts that renewed during these years and had retention rates of  and for those contracts that were up for renewal 
compared with the net operating loss for the property and casualty segment was  million in as compared with net operating income of million in the operating results include prior year reserve strengthening of  million recorded in the second quarter of related to a change in estimate of prior year net loss reserves and retrospective premium accruals  net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaty benefit  estimated losses related to the wtc event of million  net of the related corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties benefit  and restructuring and other related charges of million recorded in excluding these significant items  net operating results declined million 
net operating results for declined due to a million decline in limited partnership income  unfavorable underwriting results for the london based primary commercial and marine operations and million related to the bankruptcy filing by certain enron entities 
these declines were partially offset by lower prior year adverse loss reserve development excluding the second quarter reserve development and a million benefit related to corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties for core operations 
net operating results in benefited from a change in estimate for certain insurance related assessments of million in the combined ratio increased points in as compared with and the underwriting results for the property and casualty segment declined million 
this change was due to a decrease in the loss ratio  more than offset by increases in the expense and dividend ratios 
the loss ratio decreased points as a result of the improved underwriting results across most standard lines  particularly the automobile and package lines  due to earned rate achievement and re underwriting efforts undertaken last year  and lower prior year adverse loss development excluding the second quarter reserve strengthening 
these improvements were partially offset by reduced net earned premium base  losses related to enron  favorable loss development recorded in for the architects and engineers business not present in  declined underwriting results in global and marine lines related to current accident year reserve strengthening as discussed above  and the prior underwriting year reserve strengthening of cna re uk the expense ratio increased points primarily due to the decrease in the net earned premium base  the write off of unrecoverable deferred acquisition costs in the vehicle warranty line of business  an increase in the accrual for guaranty fund assessments related to the reliance insolvency  and the decreased impact of the change in estimate for certain insurance related assessments 
the dividend ratio increased points primarily due to adverse development in dividend reserves in standard lines in compared with favorable development taken in net written premiums for the property and casualty segment decreased  million for compared with included in net written premium was million of ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties  additional ceded premiums arising from both the reserve strengthening and wtc event  and a change in estimate for involuntary market premium accruals 
excluding these significant items  net written premium decreased million primarily as a result of a change in the timing of recording written premiums for policies with future effective dates in standard lines of million and in specialty lines of million and additional ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties of million in specialty lines and million in cna re 
partially offsetting these decreases was million of reinstatement and additional premiums related to the wtc event recorded in cna re 
net earned premiums for the property and casualty segment decreased  million for compared with included in net earned premium was  million of ceded premiums related to the corporate aggregate reinsurance treaties  additional ceded premiums arising from both the reserve strengthening and wtc event  and a change in estimate for involuntary market premium accruals 
excluding these significant items  net earned premium decreased million due primarily to the decreases in net written premium noted above 
group group operations provides group life and group health insurance and investment products and services to employers  affinity groups and other entities that purchase insurance as a group 
group operations includes three principal business units group benefits  federal markets and institutional markets and other  which also includes results from businesses that cna has exited  retail variable life and annuities  and life reinsurance 
compared with net operating income increased by million in as compared with included in the results were million related to the wtc event and million related to restructuring and other related charges 
excluding these significant items  net operating results improved million due primarily to growth in the disability and long term care products  increased investment income and diminished losses due to the exit of unprofitable variable life and annuity lines of business 
net operating results also improved due to favorable reserve development relating to the wtc event of million after tax and minority interest recorded in partially offsetting these improvements was net unfavorable reserve strengthening in group benefits due to unfavorable mortality trends 
net earned premiums for group operations decreased  million for as compared with this decline was due primarily to the transfer of the mail handlers plan partially offset by an increase in premiums in the disability and long term care products within group benefits 
net earned premiums for the mail handlers plan was  million as compared with  million in deposits for group operations decreased million for as compared with primarily due to reduced sales of s p contracts in institutional markets 
group operations achieved rate increases that averaged approximately  and in  and for the disability  accident and life lines of business within group benefits 
premium persistency rates were approximately  and in  and compared with net operating income decreased by million in as compared with included in the results were million related to the wtc event and million related to restructuring and other related charges 
included in the restructuring and other related charges was a million write off of deferred acquisition costs on in force variable life and annuity contracts as cna believes that its decision to discontinue these products would negatively impact the persistency of the business 
excluding these significant items  net operating results decreased million primarily as a result of the sale of life reinsurance and a decrease in limited partnership income of million 
life reinsurance contributed net operating income of million in partially offsetting these declines were improvements realized by exiting unprofitable lines of approximately million and increased income in other product lines  primarily the single premium guaranteed annuity  gic and disability and group long term care lines  of million 
net earned premiums for group operations decreased million for as compared with net earned premiums declined million as a result of the sale of life reinsurance 
this decline was partially offset by increases in federal markets of million due to increased medical cost trends and growth in group benefits of million  particularly in the disability and group long term care lines of business 
deposits for group operations decreased million in as compared to due to reduced sales of gic and s p contracts in institutional markets 
life life operations provides financial protection to individuals through term life insurance  universal life insurance  individual long term care insurance  annuities and other products 
life operations has several distribution relationships and partnerships including managing general agencies  other independent agencies working with cna life sales offices  a network of brokers and dealers  and other independent insurance consultants 
compared with net operating income increased by million in as compared with included in the results were million related to restructuring and other related charges and million related to the wtc event 
excluding these significant items  net operating results decreased million due primarily to net reserve strengthening for individual long term care  unfavorable individual long term care morbidity and increased costs related to the life settlement business in these decreases were partially offset by higher investment income  a decrease in reinsurance charges  favorable reserve development relating to the wtc event of million after tax and minority interest recorded in as compared with  and a million after tax and minority interest reduction of the accrual for restructuring and other related charges recorded in sales volume for life operations decreased by million in as compared with this decrease was attributable primarily to lower sales of structured settlement annuities  partially offset by increased sales in the individual long term care product 
net earned premiums increased million in as compared with attributable primarily to growth in the individual long term care product partially offset by sales declines in structured settlement annuities 
as a result of recent experience and the fourth quarter reserve strengthening of million pretax for individual long term care  cna is undertaking a full review of its product offerings in this line 
the focus is to determine whether the current products provide adequate pricing flexibility under the range of reasonably possible claims experience levels 
until this review is completed  cna intends to significantly reduce new sales of this product 
premium will continue to be received on in force business  but the actions to reduce new business will lower the rate of overall premium growth for this line 
the outcome of cna s review and potential actions could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
compared with net operating income decreased by million in as compared with included in the results were million related to restructuring and other related charges and million related to the wtc event 
excluding these significant items  net operating results decreased million due primarily to decreased investment income from limited partnerships of million 
sales volume for life operations increased by million in as compared with this increase was driven primarily by improved sales in structured settlements and increased renewals and new sales in individual long term care products 
net earned premiums increased million in as compared with this improvement is attributable primarily to improved sales of structured settlement annuities due to favorable pricing conditions and individual long term care products  partially offset by a decrease in new individual life business

compared with net operating results increased by million in as compared with the impact of the second quarter reserve strengthening on the other insurance segment was million after tax and minority interest  including million for apmt 
see the environmental pollution and mass tort and asbestos reserves section following for a discussion of this charge 
net operating income in also decreased by million of restructuring and other related charges and million related to the wtc event for group reinsurance 
excluding these significant items  net operating results improved million in as compared with reduced expenses for e business initiatives and improved results for group reinsurance were offset by lower investment income  principally resulting from a million decline in limited partnership income  higher losses related to the run off of cna unisource and severance and other costs related to changes in senior management in also contributing to the improvement was a million reduction  after tax and minority interest  in the accrual for restructuring and other related charges recorded in during  favorable net reserve development  including premium development  of million was recorded in the other insurance segment as compared with unfavorable net reserve development of million recorded in  excluding the second quarter reserve strengthening 
the gross carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was  and  million at december  and the net carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserve was  and  million at december  and personal insurance recorded unfavorable reserve development of million on accident years through these losses were subject to retroactive reinsurance agreements with allstate that cover losses occurring prior to october  these reinsurance agreements were entered into as part of the sale of cna s personal insurance business to allstate 
cna shares in indemnity and claim and allocated claim adjustment expenses if payments related to losses incurred prior to october  on the cna policies transferred to allstate exceed the claim and allocated claim adjustment expense reserves of approximately billion at the date of sale 
cna must begin to reimburse allstate for claim and allocated claim adjustment expense payments when cumulative claim payments after october  on losses occurring prior to that date exceed the billion 
cna s remaining obligation valued under this loss sharing provision as of october   will be settled by agreement of the parties or by an independent actuarial review of the unpaid claim liabilities as of that date 
cumulative payments of indemnity and allocated loss adjustment expenses on such policies are expected to exceed billion during cna has established reserves for its estimated liability under this loss sharing arrangement 
the unfavorable reserve development was principally due to continuing policyholder defense costs associated with remaining open claims 
at the end of  approximately  claims remain open 
it was anticipated these claims would be closed more quickly  eliminating further defense coverage costs 
the unfavorable reserve development on personal insurance was offset by favorable reserve development on other run off business  driven principally by financial and mortgage guarantee coverages from accident years and prior 
the favorable reserve development on financial and mortgage guarantee coverages resulted from a review of the underlying exposures and the outstanding losses 
this review showed that salvage and subrogation continues to be collected on these types of claims  thereby reducing estimated future losses net of anticipated reinsurance recoveries 
total operating revenues decreased million in as compared with this decrease was due primarily to reduced revenues for cna unisource  due to the exit of this business  and reduced investment income partially offset by increased net earned premiums in group reinsurance 
compared with net operating results declined million in as compared with the impact of the second quarter reserve strengthening on the other insurance segment was million after tax and minority interest  including million for apmt 
see the environmental pollution and mass tort and asbestos reserves section following for a discussion of this charge 
net operating income for also decreased by million for restructuring and other related charges and million related to the wtc event for group reinsurance 
excluding these significant items  net operating results increased million primarily as a result of lower interest expense on corporate borrowings in as compared with and a non recurring favorable adjustment of expense recoveries under a service contract related to personal insurance 
these increases were partially offset by million for non recurring ceding commissions included in results related to the transfer of the personal insurance line of business to allstate in  million related to increased ebusiness initiatives in and million due to decreased limited partnership income 
total operating revenues decreased million in as compared with this decline was due to a decrease in investment income and net earned premiums from run off insurance operations  particularly the entertainment and agriculture insurance lines 
environmental pollution and mass tort and asbestos apmt reserves cna s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries have actual and potential exposures related to environmental pollution and mass tort and asbestos claims 
the following table provides data related to cna s environmental pollution and mass tort and asbestos claim and claim adjustment expense reserves 
december  december  environmental environmental pollution and pollution and mass tort asbestos mass tort asbestos in millions gross reserves   ceded reserves net reserves   there was no asbestos or environmental pollution and mass tort related net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the year ended december  as a result of a change in estimate resulting from cna s semi annual ground up review of apmt accounts gross and ceded apmt reserves were increased 
the settlement scenarios that supported higher estimated gross and higher estimated ceded reserves were judged to be the most appropriate 
however  net reserves remained unchanged 
the estimation of reinsurance recoverables on accounts is highly dependent on the allocation of each account s estimated ultimate losses to their available historical insurance coverage 
this allocation becomes more refined as accounts and their insurers enter more serious settlement negotiations 
during  net reserves were identified relating to apmt related claim and claim adjustment expense reserves for assumed reinsurance pools  which reflects improvements in the identification of apmt activity from assumed reinsurance and pools 
the inclusion of these additional apmt reserves increased the apmt reserves and decreased other reserves  resulting in no net change in cna s overall carried claim and claim adjustment expense reserves 
environmental pollution and mass tort environmental pollution cleanup is the subject of both federal and state regulation 
by some estimates  there are thousands of potential waste sites subject to cleanup 
the insurance industry is involved in extensive litigation regarding coverage issues 
judicial interpretations in many cases have expanded the scope of coverage and liability beyond the original intent of the policies 
the comprehensive environmental response compensation and liability act of superfund and comparable state statutes mini superfunds govern the cleanup and restoration of toxic waste sites and formalize the concept of legal liability for cleanup and restoration by potentially responsible parties prps 
superfund and the mini superfunds establish mechanisms to pay for cleanup of waste sites if prps fail to do so  and to assign liability to prps 
the extent of liability to be allocated to a prp is dependent upon a variety of factors 
further  the number of waste sites subject to cleanup is unknown 
to date  approximately  cleanup sites have been identified by the environmental protection agency epa and included on its national priorities list npl 
state authorities have designated many cleanup sites as well 
many policyholders have made claims against various cna insurance subsidiaries for defense costs and indemnification in connection with environmental pollution matters 
the vast majority of these claims relate to accident years and prior  which coincides with cna s adoption of the simplified commercial general liability coverage form  which includes what is referred to in the industry as an absolute pollution exclusion 
cna and the insurance industry are disputing coverage for many such claims 
key coverage issues include whether cleanup costs are considered damages under the policies  trigger of coverage  allocation of liability among triggered policies  applicability of pollution exclusions and owned property exclusions  the potential for joint and several liability and the definition of an occurrence 
to date  courts have been inconsistent in their rulings on these issues 
a number of proposals to reform superfund have been made by various parties 
in  no reforms were enacted by congress 
if there is legislation  and in some circumstances even if there is no legislation  the federal role in environmental cleanup may be significantly reduced in favor of state action 
substantial changes in the federal statute or the activity of the epa may cause states to reconsider their environmental cleanup statutes and regulations 
there can be no meaningful prediction of the pattern of regulation that would result or the possible impact upon the company s results of operations or equity 
cna s ultimate liability for its environmental pollution and mass tort claims is impacted by several factors including ongoing disputes with policyholders over scope and meaning of coverage terms and in the area of environmental  court decisions that continue to restrict the scope and applicability of the absolute pollution exclusion contained in policies issued by cna post due to the inherent uncertainties described above  including the inconsistency of court decisions  the number of waste sites subject to cleanup  and in the area of environmental  the standards for cleanup and liability  the ultimate liability of cna for environmental pollution and mass tort claims may vary substantially from the amount currently recorded 
as of december  and  cna carried approximately and million of claim and claim adjustment expense reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  for reported and unreported environmental pollution and mass tort claims 
there was no environmental and mass tort net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the year ended december  unfavorable environmental pollution and mass tort net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the years ended december  and amounted to and million  respectively 
cna paid environmental pollution related claims and mass tort related claims  net of reinsurance recoveries  of  and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
asbestos cna s property and casualty insurance subsidiaries also have exposure to asbestos related claims 
estimation of asbestos related claim and claim adjustment expense reserves involves many of the same limitations discussed above for environmental pollution claims  such as inconsistency of court decisions  specific policy provisions  allocation of liability among insurers and insureds  and additional factors such as missing policies and proof of coverage 
furthermore  estimation of asbestos related claims is difficult due to  among other reasons  the proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings and attendant uncertainties  the targeting of a broader range of businesses and entities as defendants  the uncertainty as to which other insureds may be targeted in the future and the uncertainties inherent in predicting the number of future claims 
in the past several years  cna has experienced significant increases in claim counts for asbestos related claims 
the factors that led to these increases included  among other things  intensive advertising campaigns by lawyers for asbestos claimants  mass medical screening programs sponsored by plaintiff lawyers  and the addition of new defendants such as the distributors and installers of products containing asbestos 
currently  the majority of asbestos bodily injury claims are filed by persons exhibiting few  if any  disease symptoms 
it is estimated that approximately of the current non malignant asbestos claimants do not meet the american medical association s definition of impairment 
some courts  including the federal district court responsible for pre trial proceedings in all federal asbestos bodily injury actions  have ordered that so called unimpaired claimants may not recover unless at some point the claimant s condition worsens to the point of impairment 
as of december  and  cna carried approximately  and  million of net claim and claim adjustment expense reserves  net of reinsurance recoverables  for reported and unreported asbestos related claims 
there was no asbestos related net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the year ended december  unfavorable asbestos related net claim and claim adjustment expense reserve development for the years ended december  and amounted to and million 
cna paid asbestos related claims  net of reinsurance  of  and million during the years ended december   and  excluding payments made in connection with the settlement of litigation related to fibreboard corporation 
cna has structured settlement agreements with four of its policyholders for which it has future payment obligations 
structured settlement agreements provide for payments of sums certain over multiple years as set forth in each individual agreement 
as to the four structured settlement agreements existing at december   payment obligations under those settlement agreements are projected to terminate in for these four structured settlement agreements  cna has reserved million  net of reinsurance 
cna  through its acquisition of cic in  acquired obligations under the wellington agreement 
in  asbestos producers and their insurers  including cic  executed the wellington agreement 
the agreement intended to resolve all issues and litigation related to coverage for asbestos exposures 
under this agreement  signatory insurers committed scheduled policy limits and made the limits available to pay asbestos claims based upon coverage blocks designated by the policyholders in  subject to extension by policyholders 
cic was a signatory insurer to the wellington agreement 
at december   cna had fulfilled its wellington agreement obligations as to all but five accounts 
with respect to the five remaining unpaid wellington obligations  cna has evaluated its exposure under these agreements and has established a million reserve  net of reinsurance  for wellington obligations 
cna has also used coverage in place agreements to resolve large asbestos exposures 
coverage in place agreements are typically agreements between cna and its policyholders identifying the policies and the terms for payment of asbestos related liabilities 
claims payments are contingent on presentation of adequate documentation showing exposure during the policy periods and other documentation supporting the demand for claims payment 
coverage in place agreements may have annual payment caps 
at december   cna had negotiated such agreements in which cna committed coverage for payment of claims and claim related adjustment expenses subject to documentation requirements as set forth in the terms of each specific agreement 
cna has evaluated these commitments and has established a million reserve  net of reinsurance  to fund coverage in place agreements based on current projections of claims volumes and severities 
at december   cna s total ibnr reserve for asbestos was million  net of reinsurance 
for asbestos exposures  cna classifies its ibnr reserve as assigned or unassigned 
in circumstances where cna has executed a settlement agreement with its policyholder  cna assigns ibnr reserve to that account to cover the projected value of the settlement 
at december   the assigned ibnr reserve was million  net of reinsurance 
the unassigned ibnr reserve relates to potential development on accounts that have not settled and potential future claims for unidentified policyholders 
at december   cna s unassigned ibnr reserve was million  net of reinsurance 
at december   cna categorized active accounts as large or small accounts 
cna defined a large account as an active account with more than  cumulative paid losses through december  cna had large accounts with a collective reserve of million  net of reinsurance 
cna made closing large accounts a significant management priority 
small accounts were defined as active accounts with  or less cumulative paid losses through december  cna had small accounts with a collective reserve of million  net of reinsurance 
the chart below depicts cna s overall pending asbestos accounts and associated reserves asbestos reserves net percent net paid net of number of losses asbestos asbestos december  policyholders recoveries reserves reserves in millions of dollars policyholders with settlement agreements structured settlements wellington coverage in place fibreboard total with settlement agreements other policyholders with active accounts large asbestos accounts small asbestos accounts total other policyholders  assumed reinsurance and pools unassigned ibnr total   in  at least fifteen companies filed for bankruptcy protection citing costs associated with asbestos claims litigation as a basis for filing 
since  at least sixty seven companies  including the fifteen companies that filed in  that mined asbestos  or manufactured or used asbestos containing products  have filed for bankruptcy 
this phenomenon has prompted plaintiff attorneys to file claims against companies that had only peripheral involvement with asbestos 
many of these defendants were users or distributors of asbestos containing products  or manufacturers of products in which asbestos was encapsulated 
these defendants include equipment manufacturers  brake  gasket  and sealant manufacturers  and general construction contractors 
according to a comprehensive report on asbestos litigation recently released by the rand corporation  over  companies have been named as defendants in asbestos lawsuits  with out of different types of industries in the united states impacted by asbestos litigation 
the study found that a typical claimant names to defendants  up from an average of in the early years of asbestos litigation 
some asbestos related defendants have asserted that their claims for insurance are not subject to aggregate limits on coverage 
cna has such claims from a number of insureds 
some of these claims involve insureds facing exhaustion of products liability aggregate limits in their policies  who have asserted that their asbestos related claims fall within so called non products liability coverage contained within their policies rather than products liability coverage  and that the claimed non products coverage is not subject to any aggregate limit 
it is difficult to predict the ultimate size of any of the claims for coverage purportedly not subject to aggregate limits or predict to what extent  if any  the attempts to assert non products claims outside the products liability aggregate will succeed 
cna has attempted to manage such exposures by aggressive settlement strategies 
nevertheless  there can be no assurance any of these settlement efforts will be successful  or that any such claims can be settled on terms acceptable to cna 
adverse developments with respect to such matters discussed in this paragraph could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or equity 
on february   cna announced it had resolved asbestos related coverage litigation and claims involving ap green industries  ap green services and bigelow liptak corporation 
under the agreement  cna will be required to pay million  net of reinsurance recoveries  over a ten year period 
the settlement resolves cna s liabilities for all pending and future asbestos claims involving ap green industries  bigelow liptak corporation and related subsidiaries  including alleged non products exposure 
the settlement is subject to bankruptcy court approval and confirmation of a bankruptcy plan containing a channeling injunction to protect cna from any future claims 
cna s recorded reserves as of december   included reserves for this exposure 
cna is engaged in insurance coverage litigation with robert a 
keasbey company keasbey and associated claimants in new york state court 
continental casualty company v 
robert a 
keasbey company et al  supreme court state of new york county of new york  no 

keasbey was a seller and installer of asbestos products in the new york and new jersey area 
cna paid its full product liability limits to keasbey in prior years 
claimants against keasbey now claim cna owes additional coverage under the operations section of policies issued to it by cna 
cna is also a party to insurance coverage litigation between burns roe enterprises  inc burns roe and its insurance carriers related to asbestos bodily injury and wrongful death claims 
in re burns roe enterprises  inc  pending in the us bankruptcy court for the district of new jersey  no 

burns roe provided various engineering and related services in connection with construction projects 
burns roe is currently in bankruptcy 
there are numerous factual and legal issues to be resolved in connection with these cases and it is difficult to predict the outcome or financial exposure represented by these matters in light of the novel theories asserted by policyholders and their counsel 
policyholders have also initiated litigation directly against cna and other insurers 
cna has been named in adams v 
aetna  inc  et al 
circuit court of kanhwha county  west virginia  a purported class action against cna and other insurers  alleging that the defendants violated west virginia s unfair trade practices act in handling and resolving asbestos claims against their policyholders 
in addition  lawsuits have been filed in texas against cna  and other insurers and non insurer corporate defendants asserting liability for failing to warn of the dangers of asbestos 
boson v 
union carbide corp  et al 
district court of nueces county  texas 
it is difficult to predict the outcome or financial exposure represented by this type of litigation in light of the broad nature of the relief requested and the novel theories asserted 
cna reviews each active asbestos account every six months to determine whether changes in reserve estimates may be necessary 
cna considers input from its analyst professionals with direct responsibility for the claims  inside and outside counsel with responsibility for representation of cna  and its actuarial staff 
these professionals review  among many factors  the policyholder s present and future exposures including such factors as claims volume  disease mix  trial conditions  settlement demands and defense costs  the policies issued by cna including such factors as aggregate or per occurrence limits  whether the policy is primary  umbrella or excess  and the existence of policyholder retentions and or deductibles  the existence of other insurance  and reinsurance arrangements 
due to the uncertainties created by volatility in claim numbers and settlement demands  the effect of bankruptcies  the extent to which non impaired claimants can be precluded from making claims and the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage not subject to aggregate limits  the ultimate liability of cna for asbestos related claims may vary substantially from the amount currently recorded 
other variables that will influence cna s ultimate exposure to asbestos related claims will be medical inflation trends  jury attitudes  the strategies of plaintiff attorneys to broaden the scope of defendants  the mix of asbestos related diseases presented  cna s abilities to recover reinsurance  future court decisions and the possibility of legislative reform 
adverse developments with respect to such matters discussed in this paragraph could have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or equity 
with respect to environmental and mass tort reserves  commencing in and continuing into the first and second quarters of  cna received a number of new reported claims  some of which involved declaratory judgment actions premised on court decisions purporting to expand insurance coverage for pollution claims 
in these decisions  several courts adopted rules of insurance policy interpretation which established joint and several liability for insurers consecutively on a risk during a period of alleged property damage  and in other instances adopted interpretations of the absolute pollution exclusion  which weakened its effectiveness in most circumstances 
in addition to receiving new claims and declaratory judgment actions premised upon these unfavorable legal precedents  these court decisions also impacted cna s pending pollution and mass tort claims and coverage litigation 
during the spring of  cna reviewed specific claims and litigation  as well as general trends  and concluded reserve strengthening in this area was necessary 
in the area of mass torts  several well publicized verdicts arising out of bodily injury cases related to allegedly toxic mold led to a significant increase in mold related claims in and the first half of cna s reserve increase in the second quarter of was caused in part by this increased area of exposure 
with respect to other court cases and how they might affect cna s reserves and reasonable possible losses  the following should be noted 
state and federal courts issue numerous decisions each year  which potentially impact losses and reserves in both a favorable and unfavorable manner 
examples of favorable developments include decisions to allocate defense and indemnity payments in a manner so as to limit carriers obligations to damages taking place during the effective dates of their policies  decisions holding that injuries occurring after asbestos operations are completed are subject to the completed operations aggregate limits of the policies  and decisions ruling that carriers loss control inspections of their insured s premises do not give rise to a duty to warn third parties to the dangers of asbestos 
examples of unfavorable developments include decisions limiting the application of the absolute pollution exclusion  and decisions holding carriers liable for defense and indemnity of asbestos and pollution claims on a joint and several basis 
throughout  and into  cna experienced significant increases in new asbestos bodily injury claims 
in light of this development  cna formed the view that payments for asbestos claims could be higher in future years than previously estimated 
moreover  in late through mid  industry sources such as rating agencies and actuarial firms released analyses and studies commenting on the increase in claim volumes and other asbestos liability developments 
for example  am best released a study in may of increasing its ultimate asbestos reserve estimate from to billion  citing an unfunded insurance industry reserve shortfall of billion 
in june of  tillinghast raised its asbestos ultimate exposure from to billion for the insurance industry and its estimate of the ultimate remaining asbestos liability for all industries was raised to billion 
also in the to time period  a number of significant asbestos defendants filed for bankruptcy  increasing the likelihood that excess layers of insurance coverage could be called upon to indemnify policyholders and creating the potential that novel legal doctrines could be employed which could accelerate the time when such indemnification payments could be due 
these developments led cna to the conclusion that its asbestos reserves required strengthening 
the results of operations or equity of the company in future years may be adversely impacted by environmental pollution and mass tort and asbestos claim and claim adjustment expenses 
management will continue to review and monitor these liabilities and make further adjustments  including the potential for further reserve strengthening  as necessary 
lorillard lorillard  inc and subsidiaries lorillard 
lorillard  inc 
is a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the tobacco industry in the united states  including lorillard  continues to be faced with a number of issues that have or may adversely impact the business  results of operations and financial condition of lorillard and the company  including the following 
a substantial volume of litigation seeking compensatory and punitive damages ranging into the billions of dollars  as well as equitable and injunctive relief  arising out of allegations of cancer and other health effects resulting from the use of cigarettes  addiction to smoking or exposure to environmental tobacco smoke  including claims for reimbursement of health care costs allegedly incurred as a result of smoking  as well as other alleged damages 

a billion punitive damage judgment against lorillard in engle v 
rj reynolds tobacco company  et al  a class action case in state court in florida in which the jury awarded a total of billion in punitive damages against all the defendants and which is currently on appeal 

substantial annual payments by lorillard  continuing in perpetuity  and restrictions on marketing and advertising agreed to under the terms of the settlement agreements entered into between the major cigarette manufacturers  including lorillard  and each of the states  the district of columbia  the commonwealth of puerto rico and certain other us territories together  the state settlement agreements 

a continuing decline in the volume of wholesale cigarette sales in the united states  including volume declines of for the domestic us cigarette industry and for lorillard  according to information provided by management science associates 

increases in industry wide promotional expenses and sales incentives implemented in reaction to the volume declines and impact of the price increases  and continuing intense competition among the four largest cigarette manufacturers  including lorillard  and many smaller participants who have gained market share in recent years  principally in the discount and deep discount cigarette segment 
market share for the deep discount brands increased by an estimated share points from to in 
continuing and substantial increases in state excise taxes on cigarette sales in ranging from per pack to per pack in states  as well as excise tax increases by several municipalities such as new york city where the local tax increased from to in  and proposals for additional increases in federal  state and local excise taxes 
lorillard believes that increases in excise and similar taxes have had an adverse impact on sales of cigarettes and that any future increases  the extent of which cannot be predicted  could result in further volume declines for the cigarette industry  including lorillard  and an increased sales shift toward lower priced discount cigarettes rather than premium brands 

increasing sales of counterfeit cigarettes in the united states which adversely impact sales by the manufacturer of the counterfeited brands and potentially damage the value and reputation of those brands 

increases in actual and proposed federal  state and local regulation of the tobacco industry and governmental restrictions on smoking

revenues decreased due to lower net sales and reduced investment income 
net sales decreased by million in as compared to  due to lower unit sales volume of approximately million  or  assuming prices were unchanged from the prior year

federal excise taxes are included in the price of cigarettes and on january   the federal excise tax on cigarettes increased by per thousand cigarettes per pack of cigarettes to per thousand cigarettes

increased promotional expenses in  as compared to  partially offset the higher average unit prices in lorillard s overall unit sales volume decreased in as compared to newport s unit sales volume decreased by in continued decreases in unit volume for old gold and maverick in the discount segment were also contributing factors 
old gold and maverick declines were due to severe competitive price pressure from deep discount brands produced by manufacturers who do not have the same financial payment obligations related to the state settlement agreements as does lorillard and other major tobacco companies 
additionally  volume in was affected by generally weak economic conditions and ongoing limitations imposed by philip morris retail merchandising arrangements 
deep discount price brands produced by manufacturers who are not obligated by the same payment terms of the state settlement agreements have continued to increase their market share by approximately one share point during to of the us domestic market 
as a result of lower payments  these companies can price their brands at a significant advantage  by as much as  as compared with offerings from the major cigarette manufacturers

lorillard s portion of ongoing adjusted settlement payments and related legal fees are based on its share of domestic cigarette shipments in the year preceding that in which the payment is due 
accordingly  lorillard records its portions of ongoing settlement payments as part of cost of manufactured products sold as the related sales occur 
the state settlement agreements impose a stream of future payment obligations on lorillard and the other major us cigarette manufacturers and place significant restrictions on their ability to market and sell cigarettes 
the company believes that the implementation of the state settlement agreements will materially adversely affect its consolidated results of operations and cash flows in future periods 
the degree of the adverse impact will depend  among other things  on the rates of decline in us cigarette sales in the premium and discount segments  lorillard s share of the domestic premium and discount segments  and the effect of any resulting cost advantage of manufacturers not subject to all of the payments of the state settlement agreements

diamond offshore diamond offshore drilling  inc and subsidiaries diamond offshore 
diamond offshore drilling  inc is a owned subsidiary of the company 
diamond offshore s revenues vary based upon demand  which affects the number of days the fleet is utilized and the dayrates earned 
when a rig is idle  generally no dayrate is earned and revenues will decrease 
revenues can also increase or decrease as a result of the acquisition or disposal of rigs 
in order to improve utilization or realize higher dayrates  diamond offshore may mobilize its rigs from one market to another 
during periods of mobilization  however  revenues may be adversely affected 
in response to changes in demand  diamond offshore may withdraw a rig from the market by stacking it or may reactivate a rig stacked previously  which may decrease or increase revenues  respectively 
revenues from offshore turnkey drilling contracts are accrued to the extent of costs until the specified turnkey depth and other contract requirements are met 
income is recognized on the completed contract method 
provisions for future losses on turnkey contracts are recognized when it becomes apparent that expenses to be incurred on a specific contract will exceed the revenue from that contract 
operating income is primarily affected by revenue factors  but is also a function of varying levels of operating expenses 
operating expenses generally are not affected by changes in dayrates and may not be significantly affected by fluctuations in utilization 
for instance  if a rig is to be idle for a short period of time  diamond offshore may realize few decreases in operating expenses since the rig is typically maintained in a prepared state with a full crew 
in addition  when a rig is idle  diamond offshore is responsible for certain operating expenses such as rig fuel and supply boat costs  which are typically a cost of the operator under drilling contracts 
however  if the rig is to be idle for an extended period of time  diamond offshore may reduce the size of a rig s crew and take steps to cold stack the rig  which lowers expenses and partially offsets the impact on operating income 
compared with revenues decreased by million  or and net income decreased by million  or  respectively  in as compared to revenues decreased due primarily to lower contract drilling revenue of million  reduced investment income of million  and lower revenues from reimbursable expenses

any losses arising from bonds issued or assumed by the insurance subsidiaries of cna surety to the contractor are excluded from cna surety s million excess of million per principal reinsurance program with unaffiliated reinsurers in place in as a result  cna surety retains the first million of losses on bonds written with an effective date of september  and prior  and ccc will incur of losses above that retention level on bonds with effective dates prior to september  through facultative reinsurance contracts with ccc  cna surety s exposure on bonds written from october  through december  has been limited to million per bond 
indemnification and subrogation rights  including rights to contract proceeds on construction projects in the event of default  exist that reduce cna surety s and ultimately cna s exposure to loss 
while cna believes that the contractor s restructuring efforts may be successful and provide sufficient cash flow for its operations and repayment of its borrowings  the contractor s failure to achieve its restructuring plan could have a material adverse effect on cna s future results of operations

cna s insurance company subsidiaries are rated by major rating agencies  and these ratings reflect the rating agency s opinion of the insurance company s financial strength  operating performance  strategic position and ability to meet its obligations to policyholders 
agency ratings are not a recommendation to buy  sell or hold any security  and may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the issuing organization 
each agency s rating should be evaluated independently of any other agency s rating 
one or more of these agencies could take action in the future to change the ratings of cna s insurance subsidiaries 
if those ratings were downgraded as a result  the company s results of operations and or equity could be materially adversely impacted 
the table below reflects ratings issued by am best  s p  moody s and fitch as of february  for the ccc pool  cic pool  cac pool and cnagla

during the fourth quarter of  am best and fitch affirmed the existing financial strength ratings of each of the insurance pools and the debt ratings of cna as noted in the above table 
in february of  s p affirmed the ratings of the property and casualty pools  ccc and cic  and downgraded the life pool  cac  by one notch from a to a 
s p cited that the downgrade of the life operations was primarily because s p wanted to bring the ratings on all the companies in the group closer together and because the companies business profile has changed over the past two years 
corporate bonds comprise a significant portion of cna s investment portfolio 
cna regularly reviews the market value of these securities  and challenges whether an other than temporary decline in value has occurred for securities that are trading below cost see investments section  below 
in light of the current volatility in the financial markets and the dramatic impact that several recent accounting scandals have had on specific issuers  cna may be subject to future impairment losses that could materially adversely impact the company s results of operations 
any future impairment losses would not have a material impact on the company s equity 
see the discussion of cna s impairment committee in the investment section that follows 
cna s ability to pay dividends and other credit obligations is significantly dependent on receipt of dividends from its subsidiaries 
the payment of dividends to cna by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval of the insurance department of each subsidiary s domiciliary jurisdiction is limited by formula 
dividends in excess of these amounts are subject to prior approval by the respective state insurance departments 
dividends from ccc are subject to the insurance holding company laws of the state of illinois  the domiciliary state of ccc 
under these laws  ordinary dividends  or dividends that do not require prior approval of the department  may be paid only from earned surplus  which is calculated by removing unrealized gains from unassigned surplus 
as of december   ccc s earned surplus is in a positive position  thereby enabling ccc to pay approximately  million of dividend payments during that would not be subject to the department s prior approval 
the actual level of dividends paid in any year is determined after an assessment of available dividend capacity  holding company liquidity and cash needs as well as the impact the dividends will have on the statutory surplus of the applicable insurance company 
ccc s positive earned surplus at december  is contrasted to its negative earned surplus position at december  prompted  in part  by the negative earned surplus position at december   cna embarked on a capital realignment initiative within the ccc intercompany reinsurance pool pool during  the benefits of which included the restoration of ccc s earned surplus to a positive position 
this initiative involved the payment of dividends to ccc from its insurance subsidiaries during the fourth quarter of as a result of this distribution of the cumulative earnings of ccc s insurance subsidiaries  ccc s earned surplus was restored to a positive level at december   approximating  million 
this initiative involved a change to the underwriting structure of ccc and eight of its subsidiaries from the pool structure to a structure in which ccc assumes of the net underwriting risks of the group of companies formerly comprising the pool 
this is cna s first step in a multi year project to reduce duplicative legal entities  thereby facilitating more efficient operations and cost savings 
in addition  by agreement with the new hampshire insurance department  as well as certain other state insurance departments  dividend payments for the cic pool are restricted to internal and external debt service requirements through september up to a maximum of million annually  without the prior approval of the new hampshire insurance department 
cna s domestic insurance subsidiaries are subject to risk based capital requirements 
risk based capital is a method developed by the naic to determine the minimum amount of statutory capital appropriate for an insurance company to support its overall business operations in consideration of its size and risk profile 
the formula for determining the amount of risk based capital specifies various factors  weighted based on the perceived degree of risk  which are applied to certain financial balances and financial activity 
the adequacy of a company s actual capital is evaluated by a comparison to the risk based capital results  as determined by the formula 
companies below minimum risk based capital requirements are classified within certain levels  each of which requires specified corrective action 
as of december  and  all of cna s domestic insurance subsidiaries exceeded the minimum risk based capital requirements 
lorillard lorillard and other cigarette manufacturers continue to be confronted with substantial litigation and regulatory issues 
approximately  product liability cases are pending against cigarette manufacturers in the united states 
of these  approximately  cases are pending in a west virginia court  and approximately  cases have been brought by flight attendants alleging injury from exposure to environmental tobacco smoke in the cabins of aircraft 
lorillard is a defendant in all of the flight attendant suits served to date and is a defendant in most of the cases pending in west virginia 
the terms of the state settlement agreements require significant payments to be made to the settling states which began in and continue in perpetuity

lorillard s marketable securities totaled  and  million at december  and at december   fixed maturity securities represented of the total investment in marketable securities including invested in treasury bills with an average duration of days and invested in money market accounts 
the principal source of liquidity for lorillard s business and operating needs is internally generated funds from its operations 
lorillard generated net cash flow from operations of approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million for the prior year 
the increased cash flow in reflects the absence of cash payments made in related to the engle agreement and reduced inventory purchases 
lorillard believes based on current conditions  that cash flows from operating activities will be sufficient to enable it to meet its obligations under the state settlement agreements and to fund its capital expenditures 
lorillard cannot predict the impact on its cash flows of cash requirements related to any future settlements or judgments  including cash required to bond any appeals  if necessary  or the impact of subsequent legislative actions  and thus can give no assurance that it will be able to meet all of those requirements

a significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination of when an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
cna follows a consistent and systematic process for impairing securities that sustain other than temporary declines in value 
cna has established a committee responsible for the impairment process 
this committee  referred to as the impairment committee  is made up of three officers appointed by cna s chief financial officer 
the impairment committee is responsible for analyzing watch list securities on at least a quarterly basis 
the watch list includes individual securities that fall below certain thresholds or that exhibit evidence of impairment indicators including  but not limited to  a significant adverse change in the financial condition and near term prospects of the investment or a significant adverse change in legal factors  the business climate or credit ratings 
when a security is placed on the watch list  it is monitored for further market value changes and additional news related to the issuer s financial condition 
the focus is on objective evidence that may influence the evaluation of impairment factors 
the decision to impair a security incorporates both quantitative criteria and qualitative information 
the impairment committee considers a number of factors including  but not limited to a the length of time and the extent to which the market value has been less than book value  b the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  c the intent and ability of cna to retain its investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery in value  d whether the debtor is current on interest and principal payments and e general market conditions and industry or sector specific factors 
the impairment committee s decision to impair a security is primarily based on whether the security s fair value is likely to remain significantly below its book value in light of all of the factors considered 
for securities that are impaired  the security is written down to fair value and the resulting losses are recognized as investment losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
realized investment losses included  and million of pretax impairment losses for the years ended december   and the impairments recorded in were primarily the result of the continued credit deterioration on specific issuers in the bond and equity markets and the effects on such markets due to the overall slowing of the economy 
for the year ended december   the impairment losses recorded related primarily to corporate bonds in the communications industry sectors including million related to worldcom inc  million related to adelphia communication corporation  million for charter communications  million for at t canada  and million for telewest plc 
for the year ended december  the impairment losses recorded related primarily to corporate bonds and equities in the communications industry sector including million for medicalogic medscape  inc and million for at home corporation 
for the year ended december  the impairment losses recorded related primarily to corporate bonds and equities and were largely spread amongst the consumer  financial  and communications industry sectors including million for specialty foods corporation 
if the deterioration in these industry sectors continues in future periods and cna continues to hold these securities  cna is likely to have additional impairments in the future 
during the second quarter of  cna announced its intention to sell certain businesses 
the assets being held for disposition included cna re uk and certain other businesses 
based upon the impairment analyses performed at that time  cna anticipated that it would realize losses in connection with those planned sales 
in determining the anticipated loss from these sales  cna estimated the net realizable value of each business being held for sale 
an estimated loss of million after tax and minority interest was initially recorded in the second quarter of this loss was reported in other realized investment losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
in the fourth quarter of  cna sold certain businesses as planned 
the realized after tax loss applicable to these businesses recognized in the second quarter of was million after tax and minority interest 
revenues of these businesses included in the years ended december  and totaled approximately and million 
these businesses contributed approximately and million after tax and minority interest of net losses in the years ended december  and cna regularly updates its impairment analyses and adjusts its loss as necessary 
based on these updated analyses the impairment loss was reduced by approximately million after tax and minority interest in the fourth quarter of  primarily because the net assets of the businesses had been significantly diminished by their operating losses  including adverse loss reserve development recognized by cna re uk in the fourth quarter of the reduction of the impairment was included in investment gains in the consolidated statements of operations 
the statutory surplus of cna re uk was below the required regulatory minimum surplus level at december  ccc contributed million of capital on march  bringing the capital above the regulatory minimum 
on october   cna completed the sale of cna re uk to tawa 
the sale includes business underwritten since inception by cna re uk  except for certain risks retained by ccc as discussed below 
in october  the sale was approved in the united kingdom by the financial services authority fsa and by the illinois insurance department 
this sale does not impact cna re s on going us based operations 
the purchase price was  subject to adjustments based primarily upon the results of operations and realized foreign currency losses of cna re uk the final purchase price adjustments were prepared by tawa and have been agreed to by cna 
under the terms of the purchase price adjustment  ccc is entitled to receive million from tawa after tawa is able to legally withdraw funds from the former cna re uk entities 
ccc has also committed to contribute up to million to the former cna re uk entities over a four year period beginning in should the fsa deem those entities to be undercapitalized 
the purchase price adjustment related to foreign currency losses resulted in cna contributing additional capital to cna re uk of million 
as the sale and related agreements have now been completed  cna has finalized its impairment analysis based upon the terms of the completed transactions 
as such  in the fourth quarter of  the impairment loss was reduced by approximately million after tax and minority interest 
the reduction of the impairment was included in net realized investment gains 
concurrent with the sale  several reinsurance agreements under which ccc had provided retrocessional protection to cna re uk were terminated

as discussed previously  a significant judgment in the valuation of investments is the determination of when an other than temporary impairment has occurred 
cna s impairment committee analyzes securities placed on the watch list on at least a quarterly basis 
part of this analysis is to monitor the length of time and severity of the decline below book value of the watch list securities 
the following table summarizes the fair value and gross unrealized loss of non investment grade securities categorized by the length of time those securities have been in a continuous unrealized loss position and further categorized by the severity of the unrealized loss position in increments as of december  fair value as a percentage of book value estimated unrealized december  fair value loss in millions fixed maturity securities non investment grade months months months greater than months total non investment grade  the non investment grade securities that were in an unrealized loss severity of less than for longer than six months as of december  primarily consisted of securities in the utilities  communication and transportation sectors representing  and respectively of the gross unrealized loss 
the non investment grade securities that were in an unrealized loss severity of less than for greater than months as of december  primarily consisted of securities in the communications and transportation sector representing and  of the gross unrealized loss 
unrealized losses in the communication sector are predominately attributable to a european leader in telecommunication services 
the unrealized losses on securities held in the transportation sector are primarily comprised of debt issued from a major domestic airline 
as part of the ongoing impairment monitoring process  the impairment committee has evaluated the facts and circumstances based on available information for each of these non investment grade securities and determined that no further impairments were necessary at december  this determination was based on a number of factors that the committee regularly considers including  but not limited to the issuers ability to meet current and future interest and principal payments  an evaluation of the issuers financial condition and near term prospects  cna s sector outlook and estimates of the fair value of any underlying collateral 
in all cases where a decline in value is judged to be temporary  cna had the intent and ability to hold these securities for a period of time sufficient to recover the book value of its investment through a recovery in the market value of such securities or by holding the securities to maturity 
in many cases  the securities held are matched to liabilities as part of ongoing asset liability duration management 
as such the impairment committee continually assesses its ability to hold securities for a time sufficient to recover any temporary loss in value or until maturity 
cna maintains sufficient levels of liquidity so as to not impact the asset liability management process 
cna s equity securities held as of december  that were in an unrealized loss position had a fair value of million 
cna s impairment committee  under the same process as fixed maturity securities  monitors the equity securities for other than temporary declines in value

high yield securities generally involve a greater degree of risk than investment grade securities 
however  expected returns should compensate for the added risk 
this risk is also considered in the interest rate assumptions for the underlying insurance products

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is a large diversified financial services company 
as such  it and its subsidiaries have significant amounts of financial instruments that involve market risk 
the company s measure of market risk exposure represents an estimate of the change in fair value of its financial instruments 
changes in the trading portfolio would be recognized as investment gains losses in the consolidated statements of operations 
market risk exposure is presented for each class of financial instrument held by the company at december  assuming immediate adverse market movements of the magnitude described below 
the company believes that the various rates of adverse market movements represent a measure of exposure to loss under hypothetically assumed adverse conditions 
the estimated market risk exposure represents the hypothetical loss to future earnings and does not represent the maximum possible loss nor any expected actual loss  even under adverse conditions  because actual adverse fluctuations would likely differ 
in addition  since the company s investment portfolio is subject to change based on its portfolio management strategy as well as in response to changes in the market  these estimates are not necessarily indicative of the actual results which may occur 
exposure to market risk is managed and monitored by senior management 
senior management approves the overall investment strategy employed by the company and has responsibility to ensure that the investment positions are consistent with that strategy and the level of risk acceptable to it 
the company may manage risk by buying or selling instruments or entering into offsetting positions 
equity price risk the company has exposure to equity price risk as a result of its investment in equity securities and equity derivatives 
equity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of equity prices which affect the value of equity securities or instruments that derive their value from such securities or indexes 
equity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous change in the underlying reference price or index from its level at december  and  with all other variables held constant 
interest rate risk the company has exposure to interest rate risk arising from changes in the level or volatility of interest rates 
the company attempts to mitigate its exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing instruments such as interest rate swaps  interest rate caps  commitments to purchase securities  options  futures and forwards 
the company monitors its sensitivity to interest rate risk by evaluating the change in the value of its financial assets and liabilities due to fluctuations in interest rates 
the evaluation is performed by applying an instantaneous change in interest rates by varying magnitudes on a static balance sheet to determine the effect such a change in rates would have on the recorded market value of the company s investments and the resulting effect on shareholders equity 
the analysis presents the sensitivity of the market value of the company s financial instruments to selected changes in market rates and prices which the company believes are reasonably possible over a one year period 
the sensitivity analysis estimates the change in the market value of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities that were held on december  and due to instantaneous parallel shifts in the yield curve of basis points  with all other variables held constant 
the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market rates 
accordingly the analysis may not be indicative of  is not intended to provide  and does not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes of market interest rates on the company s earnings or shareholders equity 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the company could undertake in response to changes in interest rates 
the company s long term debt  as of december  and is denominated in us dollars 
the company s debt has been primarily issued at fixed rates  and as such  interest expense would not be impacted by interest rate shifts 
the impact of a basis point increase in interest rates on fixed rate debt would result in a decrease in market value of and million  respectively 
a basis point decrease would result in an increase in market value of and million  respectively 
foreign exchange rate risk foreign exchange rate risk arises from the possibility that changes in foreign currency exchange rates will impact the value of financial instruments 
the company has foreign exchange rate exposure when it buys or sells foreign currencies or financial instruments denominated in a foreign currency 
this exposure is mitigated by the company s asset liability matching strategy and through the use of futures for those instruments which are not matched 
the company s foreign transactions are primarily denominated in canadian dollars  british pounds and the european monetary unit 
the sensitivity analysis also assumes an instantaneous change in the foreign currency exchange rates versus the us dollar from their levels at december  and  with all other variables held constant 
commodity price risk the company has exposure to commodity price risk as a result of its investments in gold options 
commodity price risk results from changes in the level or volatility of commodity prices that impact instruments which derive their value from such commodities 
commodity price risk was measured assuming an instantaneous change of from their levels at december  and the following tables present the company s market risk by category equity markets  interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices on the basis of those entered into for trading purposes and other than trading purposes 
trading portfolio category of risk exposure fair value asset liability market risk december amounts in millions equity markets equity securities options purchased written index futures long short sales separate accounts equity securities a other invested assets interest rate options on government securities short interest rate swaps separate accounts fixed maturities short term investments gold options purchased written note the calculation of estimated market risk exposure is based on assumed adverse changes in the underlying reference price or index of a decrease in equity prices of  a decrease in interest rates of basis points at december  and an increase in interest rates of basis points at december  and a decrease in gold prices of at december  and an increase in gold prices of at december  adverse changes on options which differ from those presented above would not necessarily result in a proportionate change to the estimated market risk exposure 
a in addition  the separate accounts carry positions in equity index futures 
a decrease in equity prices of would result in market risk amounting to and million at december  and  respectively 
this market risk would be offset by decreases in liabilities to customers under variable insurance contracts

an assumed decline in the underlying exchange rates would result in an aggregate foreign currency exchange rate risk of  and million at december  and  respectively 
b certain fixed maturities positions include options embedded in convertible debt securities 
a decrease in underlying equity prices of would result in market risk amounting to and million at december  and  respectively
