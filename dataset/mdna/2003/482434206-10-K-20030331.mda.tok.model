item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is a discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements including the notes thereto included elsewhere in this form k 
forward looking statements the information discussed in this annual report on form k includes forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act  and section e of the exchange act 
all statements  other than statements of historical facts  included herein concerning  among other things  planned capital expenditures  increases in oil and gas production  the number of anticipated wells to be drilled after the date hereof  the company s financial position  business strategy and other plans and objectives for future operations  are forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are identified by their use of terms and phrases such as expect  estimate  project  plan  believe  achievable  anticipate and similar terms and phrases 
although the company believes that the expectations reflected in such forward looking statements are reasonable  they do involve certain assumptions  risks and uncertainties  and the company can give no assurance that such expectations will prove to be correct 
the company s actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including the timing and success of the company s drilling activities  the volatility of prices and supply and demand for oil and gas  the numerous uncertainties inherent in estimating quantities of oil and gas reserves and actual future production rates and associated costs  the usual hazards associated with the oil and gas industry including blowouts  cratering  pipe failure  spills  explosions and other unforeseen hazards  changes in regulatory requirements  or if underlying assumptions prove incorrect 
these and other risks are described in greater detail in oil and gas risk factors included elsewhere in this form k 
all forward looking statements attributable to the company or persons acting on its behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors 
other than required under the securities laws  the company does not assume a duty to update these forward looking statements 
general our main objective in was to position the company to meet our senior note obligations due january  in order to meet this objective  we curtailed our drilling and overall capital expenditure programs and sold certain non core assets 
these actions positioned us to reduce debt and negotiate the financing necessary to pay off the remaining portion of the maturing senior notes during a difficult period in the capital markets 
although the asset sales and curtailed drilling and capital expenditure programs resulted in lower production and reserves in  we exited the year in a stronger financial position  with increased financial flexibility  a focused asset base in our core areas  and a quality multi year drilling prospect inventory 
on january   we completed the arrangements necessary to amend and restate our existing credit agreement with a group of institutional lenders 
the amended facility provides million of borrowing capacity  million in the form of a term loan and million in revolving facilities  and matures on october  initial proceeds of million were used primarily to pay off the balance of the maturing senior note obligations  leaving million of available borrowing capacity under the facility 
prices for oil and natural gas are subject to wide fluctuations in response to relatively minor changes in the supply of and demand for oil and natural gas  market uncertainty and a variety of additional factors that are beyond our control 
these factors include political conditions in the middle east and elsewhere  domestic and foreign supply of oil and natural gas  the level of industrial and consumer demand  weather conditions and overall economic conditions 
application of critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect our financial position and results of operations 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
certain of these accounting policies involve judgments and uncertainties to such an extent that there is a reasonable likelihood that materially different amounts could have been reported under different conditions  or if different assumptions had been used 
we discussed the development  selection  and disclosure of each of these critical accounting estimates with our audit committee 
the following discussion details the more significant accounting policies  estimates and judgments 
full cost method of accounting for oil and gas operations the accounting for our business is subject to accounting rules that are unique to the oil and gas industry 
there are two allowable methods of accounting for oil and gas business activities  the successful efforts method and the full cost method 
we have elected to use the full cost method to account for our investment in oil and gas properties 
under this method  the company capitalizes all acquisition  exploration and development costs into one cost center 
such costs include lease acquisitions  geological and geophysical services  drilling  equipment  and salaries  benefits and other internal costs directly attributable to these activities 
these costs are then amortized over the remaining life of the aggregate oil and gas reserves using the unit of production method of calculating depletion expense discussed below under amortization of oil and gas properties 
the full cost method embraces the concept that dry holes and other expenditures that fail to add reserves are intrinsic to the oil and gas exploration business  and are therefore capitalized 
although some of these costs will ultimately result in no additional reserves  they are part of a program from which we expect the benefits of successful wells to more than offset the costs of any unsuccessful ones 
as a result  we believe that the full cost method of accounting to be appropriate and reflective of the economics of our programs for the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
under the successful efforts method  costs of exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs that would be capitalized under the full cost method would be charged against earnings during the periods in which the occur 
accordingly  our financial position and results of operations may have been significantly different had we used the successful efforts method of accounting for our oil and gas investments 
oil and gas reserve estimates estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves are based on the quantities of oil and gas which geological and engineering data demonstrate  with reasonable certainty  to be recoverable in future years from known reservoirs under existing economic and operating conditions 
the accuracy of any oil and gas reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data  engineering and geological interpretation  and judgment 
for example  we must estimate the amount and timing of future operating costs  severance taxes  development costs  and workover costs  all of which may in fact vary considerably from actual results 
in addition  as prices and cost levels change from year to year  the estimate of proved reserves also change 
any significant variance in these assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantity and value of our reserves 
despite the inherent imprecision in these engineering estimates  estimates of our oil and gas reserves are used throughout our financial statements 
for example  since we use the unit of production method  the amortization rate of our capitalized oil and gas properties incorporates the estimated units of production attributable to the estimates of proved reserves 
our oil and gas properties are also subject to a ceiling limitation based in part on the quantity of our proved reserves 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
finally  these reserves are the basis for our supplemental oil and gas disclosures 
the estimates of our proved oil and gas reserves have been prepared or audited by nsa  independent petroleum engineers 
amortization of oil and gas properties effective january   kcs began amortizing the capitalized costs related to oil and gas properties under the unit of production basis uop method using proved oil and gas reserves 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
under the uop method  the amortization rate is computed based on the portion of our reserves produced  including reserves and production associated with the production payment 
this rate is applied to the amortizable base of our oil and gas properties the net book value of oil and gas properties less the costs of unevaluated oil and gas properties plus estimated future costs to develop the oil and gas properties 
the calculation of dd a requires the use of significant estimates pertaining to oil and gas reserves and future development costs 
bad debt expense we routinely assess the recoverability of all material trade and other receivables to determine their collectibility 
many of our receivables are from joint interest owners on properties we operate 
thus  we may have the ability to withhold future revenue disbursements to recover any non payment of joint interest billings 
the company markets the majority of its production and these receivables are generally collected within a month 
the receivables for the remaining production is typically collected within two months 
we accrue a reserve for a receivable when  based on the judgment of management  it is probable that such receivable will not be collected in full and the amount of any reserve required can be reasonably estimated 
revenue recognition gas imbalances can arise on properties for which two or more owners have the right to take production in kind 
in a typical gas balancing arrangement  each owner is entitled to an agreed upon percentage of the property s total production 
however  at any given time  the amount of gas sold by each owner may differ from its allowable percentage 
two principal accounting practices have evolved to account for gas imbalances 
these methods differ as to whether revenue is recognized based on the actual sale of gas sales method or an owner s entitled share of the current period s production entitlement method 
we have elected to use the sales method 
under this method  a liability is recognized for an imbalance only when the estimated remaining reserves will not be sufficient to enable the under produced owner to recoup its entitled share through future production 
had we used the entitlement method  our reported revenues could have been materially different 
income taxes we record deferred tax assets and liabilities to account for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements and our tax returns 
we routinely assess the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
numerous judgments and assumptions are inherent in the estimation of future taxable income  including assumptions with respect to our future operating results particularly as related to volatile oil and gas prices 
such judgments and assumptions are inherently imprecise and may prove to be materially incorrect in the future 
asset retirement obligations we have significant obligations to remove equipment and restore land at the end of oil and gas production operations 
our removal and restoration obligations are primarily associated with plugging and abandoning wells 
the estimated undiscounted costs  net of equipment salvage value  of dismantling and removing these facilities are accrued over the production life of the oil and gas property as additional dd a 
estimating the future asset removal costs is difficult and requires management to make estimates and judgments because most of the removal obligations are many years in the future and because contracts and regulations often have vague descriptions of what constitutes removal 
asset removal technologies and costs are constantly changing  as are political  environmental  safety and public relations considerations 
in addition  the financial accounting standards board fasb has recently issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  sfas no 
 which significantly changes the method of accruing for costs  associated with the retirement of fixed assets  that an entity is legally obligated to incur 
sfas no 
requires us to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets in the periods in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  we increase the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to the fair value at the time of settlement over the useful life of the asset  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
we adopted sfas no 
effective on january  as a result  net property  plant and equipment was increased by million  an asset retirement obligation of million was recorded and a million charge against net income will be reported in the first quarter of as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
derivatives we use commodity derivative contracts on a limited basis to manage our exposure to oil and gas price volatility 
kcs accounts for its commodity derivative contracts in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

realized gains and losses from our cash flow hedges  including terminated contracts  are generally recognized in oil and gas production revenue when the hedged volumes are produced and sold 
we do not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
results of operations for the years ended december   and results of operations income before income taxes for was million compared to million in dramatically lower natural gas prices  lower non oil and gas revenue and lower production were partially offset by significantly lower operating  reorganization and interest expenses 
income tax expense for was million compared to an income tax benefit of million in as a result of the non cash income tax expense in see note to consolidated financial statements  we reported a net loss before cumulative effect of accounting change of million  or per basic and diluted share 
the cumulative effect of accounting change related to the amortization method for oil and gas properties was a million loss  or per basic and diluted share 
net loss in was million  or per basic and diluted share compared to net income of million  or per basic share per diluted share in net income for was million  or per basic share per diluted share  compared to million  or per basic and diluted share in this increase was attributable to higher average realized natural gas prices  increased working interest production  higher other revenue and lower interest expense partially offset by lower production from the vpp program  lower oil prices and higher operating expenses 
reorganization items in were million compared to million in revenue production a gas mmcf    oil mbbl    liquids mbbl summary mmcfe working interest    purchased vpp    total    average price b gas per mcf oil per bbl liquids per bbl total per mcfe revenue gas    oil    liquids    total    a production includes  mmcfe and  mmcfe in and  respectively  dedicated to the production payment sold in february see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
b includes the effects of hedging and  in and  amortization of deferred revenue attributed to deliveries under the production payment sold in february see note to consolidated financial statements 
gas revenue 
in  gas revenue was million compared to million in as a result of a decrease in realized natural gas prices and a decline in production 
the production decline was primarily due to the sale of oil and gas properties  expiration of certain vpp s and no additional investment in the vpp program in or due to limited capital availability 
furthermore  the natural decline of producing properties was not fully offset by new production largely due to the reduction in the capital investment program 
see liquidity and capital resources 
in  gas revenue was million compared to million in higher natural gas prices during the first half of the year and a increase in working interest production were offset by a bcf decrease in scheduled production from the vpp program and the dramatic decline in natural gas prices during the second half of average realized gas prices during the first half of were per mcf compared to during the second half of the year 
the decrease in vpp production reflects the expiration of certain vpps  limited investment in the program since and no investment in oil and liquids revenue 
in  oil and liquids revenue decreased million to million primarily due to a decrease in production 
the decrease in production in was attributable to the sale of oil and gas properties and the natural declines of producing properties 
in  oil and liquids revenue decreased million to million primarily due to a decrease in average realized oil prices 
other revenue  net 
other revenue  net decreased from million in to a net cost of million in of the million in  million was from the sale of emission reduction credits and million was from non cash gains on derivative instruments that were not designated as oil and gas hedges when we adopted sfas no 
see note to consolidated financial statements  and the remainder was primarily attributable to marketing and transportation revenue incidental to our oil and gas operations 
in  the net cost of million was primarily attributable to gas marketing and transportation activities 
in  other revenue  net included million from the settlement of certain claims related to a acquisition and million from the sale of emission reduction credits 
lease operating expenses for the year ended december   lease operating expenses decreased to million  compared to million in increased focus on cost reductions and operating efficiency along with the sale of certain properties contributed to the reductions 
for the year ended december   lease operating expenses increased to million  compared to million in the increased costs in reflect start up costs associated with our hartland gas processing plant in michigan incurred during the first quarter of the year  higher ad valorem taxes  higher working interest production  and increased costs of workovers on oil and gas wells in order to maximize production during the first half of when natural gas prices were high 
production taxes production taxes  which are generally based on a percentage of revenue excluding revenue from the vpp program  decreased million to million in compared to million in due to lower oil and gas revenue associated with the decrease in working interest production and lower average realized prices 
production taxes increased million to million in  compared to million in due to higher average natural gas prices and the increase in working interest production 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased million to million in  compared to million in as a result of lower labor cost associated with a reduced work force  partially offset by an increase in insurance premiums and employment severance payments 
general and administrative expenses were million in  which included approximately million of costs associated with the retention bonus program for employees other than senior management that was put in place in october in order for us to retain our employees during the reorganization process 
excluding the effect of the retention bonus program  g a in decreased compared to as a result of lower salaries and wages due to a reduced workforce 
stock compensation stock compensation was million in compared to million in these amounts reflect the non cash amortization of restricted stock grants issued to our employees under the stock plan 
the expense includes incremental costs associated with initial grants made upon our emergence from chapter to compensate for a portion of stock options previously issued but cancelled in connection with the plan of reorganization 
bad debt expense we routinely assess the collectibility of our trade and other receivables 
bad debt expense was million in  which represents an allowance against certain joint interest receivables  the collection of which has been determined to be doubtful 
bad debt expense was million in  primarily with respect to an allowance against receivables due from enron entities  which are now in bankruptcy  for oil and gas sales and derivative instruments 
we ceased all sales to enron entities after november see note to consolidated financial statements for information with respect to derivative contracts that we had with enron entities 
depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a effective january   we began amortizing our oil and gas properties using the uop method based on proved reserves 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
this change resulted in additional amortization of million through december   which is classified as a cumulative effect of accounting change  net of tax  in for the year ended december   dd a decreased million to million 
the decrease reflects reduced production and a lower depletable base 
for the year ended december   dd a increased million to million  reflecting an increase in the dd a rate largely due to the dramatic decline in natural gas prices during the second half of and a higher depletable base 
interest and other income interest and other income was million in compared to million in and million in these amounts primarily represent interest income earned on accumulated cash and cash equivalents 
in  we also reported million of interest income associated with accumulated cash and cash equivalents as a component of reorganization items pursuant to sop interest expense interest expense was million in compared to million in and million in the lower interest expense in reflects the trend of lowering outstanding debt and  to a lesser extent  lower interest rates on our credit facility  partially offset by a million write off of deferred financing costs in december see note to consolidated financial statements 
interest expense in includes million of interest on past due interest with respect to our senior notes and senior subordinated notes in accordance with our plan of reorganization 
reorganization items we completed our reorganization in and consequently there were no reorganization items in for the year ended december   we recorded million of reorganization items  primarily for legal and financial advisory services in connection with the completed chapter proceedings 
during  we recorded million of net reorganization items  million of which was a non cash write off of deferred debt issuance costs associated with the senior notes and senior subordinated notes in accordance with statement of position the balance reflects restructuring costs of million  primarily for legal and financial advisory services 
during  we earned interest income of million on cash accumulated during the chapter proceedings  which partially offset the foregoing charges 
income taxes income tax expense in was million resulting from a million non cash increase in our valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets at june   partially offset by a million non cash tax benefit decrease in the valuation allowance primarily associated with certain derivative instruments initially accounted for as a component of the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle upon adoption of sfas no 
as discussed in note to consolidated financial statements  we routinely assess the valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets 
during the second quarter of  we concluded that the million increase in the valuation allowance  which reduced the carrying value of net deferred assets to zero  was appropriate 
in making that assessment  we considered several factors  including future projections of taxable income  which reflected relatively low natural gas and oil prices at that time  and the january maturity of our senior note obligations that required refinancing 
while the senior note obligations have now been refinanced and natural gas and oil prices have improved significantly in recent months  we continue maintain the valuation allowance against of our net deferred tax assets 
we made this determination since  at this time  it is difficult to project the necessary levels of future taxable income with sufficient certainty  considering the significant volatility in natural gas and oil prices and that the current higher price environment has existed for only a short period 
we will continue to assess the necessity for the valuation allowance  and to the extent it is determined that such allowance is no longer required  the tax benefit of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be recognized in the future 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
on january   we recorded a liability of million representing the fair market value of our derivative instruments upon adoption and an after tax charge to other comprehensive income of million from the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
during  we reclassified million of the liability as a non cash reduction to oil and gas revenues and reduced the valuation allowance related primarily to net operating losses  for a related tax benefit of million 
no income taxes were recorded in related to pre tax book income as a portion of the valuation allowance account established in was reversed due to our assessment of our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our main objective in was to position the company to meet our senior note obligations due january  in order to meet this objective  we curtailed our drilling and overall capital expenditure programs and sold certain non core assets 
these actions positioned us to reduce debt and negotiate the financing necessary to pay off the remaining portion of the maturing senior notes during a difficult period in the capital markets 
although the asset sales and curtailed drilling and capital expenditure programs resulted in lower production and reserves in  we exited the year in a stronger financial position  with increased financial flexibility  a focused asset base in our core areas  and a quality multi year drilling prospect inventory 
on january   we completed the arrangements necessary to amend and restate our existing credit agreement credit agreement with a group of institutional lenders 
initial proceeds of million were used primarily to pay off the balance of the maturing senior note obligations  leaving million of available borrowing capacity under the facility 
we reduced lifting costs lease operating expenses and production taxes by and general and administrative expenses by in and expect further reductions in with the completion of the financing and the implementation of this cost reduction program  we believe that we are well positioned to capitalize on the strong natural gas price environment and to focus on developing our prospect inventory to grow reserves and production in our core areas 
we have reduced debt from a peak of million in early to million on january  and are committed to further debt reduction 
cash flow from operating activities net cash provided by operating activities for was million compared to million in the cash provided by operating activities was significantly impacted by the execution of the plan of reorganization which included net proceeds of million from the production payment sold in february see notes and to consolidated financial statements  the payment of million of interest expense million of which pertained to prior years and the million cost of terminating certain derivative instruments in connection with the emergence from chapter the cash provided by operating activities was negatively impacted by lower realized natural gas prices and lower production as discussed above 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in compared to million in in addition to the impact of the execution of the plan of reorganization  was favorably impacted by higher natural gas prices and higher other revenue 
in  the net increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities  inclusive of accrued interest was primarily due to the suspension of interest payments on the senior notes and senior subordinated notes during the period of reorganization and to accrued restructuring costs 
investing activities capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  of which  million was for development activities  million for the acquisition of proved reserves and million for lease acquisitions  seismic surveys and exploratory drilling 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million  of which million was for development activities  million for the acquisition of proved reserves  million for lease acquisitions  seismic surveys and exploratory drilling and million for other assets 
capital expenditures for the year ended december  were million of which million was for development activities  million for the acquisition of proved reserves and million for lease acquisitions  seismic surveys and exploratory drilling 
other capital expenditures were million  of which million was for the construction of a gas processing facility 
capital spending for has initially been budgeted at million 
the capital program is expected to be funded with internally generated cash 
credit facilities the credit agreement  which matures on october   provides up to million of borrowing capacity  million in the form of a term loan  a million revolving a facility and a million revolving b facility 
borrowing capacity is subject to monthly borrowing base calculations with respect to the value of certain of the company s oil and gas assets 
initial proceeds of million were used primarily to pay off the company s maturing senior note obligations 
the term loan and the revolving b facility  which may be prepaid at any time without penalty  bear interest based on the prime rate  initially equating to  and increasing annually 
the revolving a facility bears  at the company s option  an interest rate of libor plus to or prime plus to  depending on utilization 
the revolving a facility requires a commitment fee of per annum on the unused availability and carries an early termination penalty of in the first year and in the second year 
financing fees associated with the amended and restated agreement have been recorded as deferred charges and are being amortized as interest expense over the life of the credit agreement 
the remaining deferred financing fees associated with the original agreement were written off to interest expense in december certain other fees are also payable under the credit facility based on services provided 
substantially all of the company s assets are pledged to secure the credit agreement 
the credit agreement contains various restrictive covenants including ratios of debt to ebitda  interest coverage  fixed charge coverage and liquidity 
the credit agreement also contains provisions that require the hedging of a portion of the company s oil and gas production  payment upon a change of control  restrictions on the payment of dividends and certain other restricted payments and places limitations on the incurrence of additional debt  capital expenditures  the sale of assets  and the repurchase of senior subordinated notes 
any repayment made on the term loan portion of the facility will permanently reduce the funds available under the credit agreement 
contractual cash obligations the following table quantifies our future contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years in thousands of dollars long term debt    redeemable convertible preferred stock a   operating leases    unconditional purchase obligations    a subsequent to december    of convertible preferred stock was exchanged for our common stock 
the preferred stock is redeemable at our option if the closing price of the common stock exceeds per share for out of consecutive trading days or at the election of holders of a majority of the outstanding shares of the preferred stock on or after january  see notes  and to consolidated financial statements 
other commercial commitments in connection with the production payment discussed in notes and to the consolidated financial statement  we have obligations to deliver bcfe in  bcfe in  bcfe in and bcfe in at december   we had million of surety bonds that remain outstanding until specific events or projects are completed and claims are settled 
in february  a one year million standby letter of credit was issued under the credit agreement in support of our hedging program 
new accounting principles in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for legal obligations associated with the retirement obligations of tangible long lived assets in the periods in which it is incurred 
when the liability is initially recorded  the entity increases the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
the liability is accreted to the fair value at the time of settlement over the useful life of the asset  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset 
the company adopted sfas no 
effective on january  as a result  property  plant and equipment was increased by million  an additional asset retirement obligation of million was recorded and a million charge against net income will be reported in the first quarter of as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas no 

sfas no 
addresses the financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supersedes sfas no 
but retains its fundamental provisions for the a recognition measurement of impairment of long lived assets to be held and used and b measurement of long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas no 
also supersedes the accounting reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
for segments of a business to be disposed of but retains the requirement to report discontinued operations separately from continuing operations and extends that reporting to a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
effective january   with no significant impact 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative instruments 
the company s major market risk exposure is to oil and gas prices  which have historically been volatile 
realized prices are primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and regional spot prices for natural gas production 
the company has utilized  and may continue to utilize  derivative contracts  including swaps  futures contracts  options and collars to manage this price risk 
the company does not enter into derivative or other financial instruments for speculative purposes 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
while these derivative contracts are structured to reduce the company s exposure to decreases in the price associated with the underlying commodity  they also limit the benefit the company might otherwise receive from any price increases 
at december   the company had no outstanding derivative financial instruments 
during february  the company invested million in a series of derivative transactions covering million mmbtu of gas production for april through november these instruments establish an average floor price of and enable the company to receive market prices up to an average cap of  approximately of any price realized between and and of any price realized above

for  the company delivered approximately of its production under the production payment sold in february at an average realized price of per mcfe and also entered into derivative arrangements designed to reduce price downside risk for approximately of the balance of its production 
for the year  the company delivered approximately of its production under the production payment and also entered into derivative contracts which covered approximately of the balance of its production 
interest rate risk 
the company uses fixed and variable rate long term debt to finance its capital spending program and for general corporate purposes 
these variable rate debt instruments expose the company to market risk related to changes in interest rates 
the company s fixed rate debt and the associated weighted average interest rate was million at on december  and million at on december  the company s variable rate debt and weighted average interest rate was million at on december  the company had no variable rate debt on december  the table below presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by expected maturity dates for the company s debt obligations at december  the fixed rate debt due in was replaced with variable rate debt on january  see note to consolidated financial statements
