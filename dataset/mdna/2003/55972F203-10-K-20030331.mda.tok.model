our results of operations are significantly affected by our ability to maintain or increase oil and natural gas production through exploration and exploitation activities 
fluctuations in oil and gas prices also significantly affect our results of operations 
successful merger and acquisition activities also have a large impact on our results of operations by increasing proved reserves in our core areas which allow us greater exploration and production potential paired with existing operation and production expertise in these areas

the transaction had an effective date of july  on march   we completed our merger with prize energy corp 
prize  a publicly traded oil and gas production company engaged primarily in the acquisition  enhancement  and exploitation of producing oil and gas properties

our cash provided by operations was lower than the prior year due to higher receivables balances at year end  large margins posted on our hedged positions  and payments to reduce the balances of the liabilities acquired in the prize merger 
these increases were partially offset by increased cash flows from tax refunds and closed positions on hedging assets acquired in the prize merger

in the period compared to the period  a reduction in trade accounts receivable and an increase in trade accounts payable balances also contributed to increased operating cash flows 
our net working capital position at december  was a deficit of million 
at this date  we had million available under our senior bank facility 
a large factor in our negative working capital position was the million current derivative liability we recorded at december  on our hedged positions due to continued increases in commodities prices over our hedged prices during the second  third and fourth quarters of this liability was partially offset by approximately million of current deferred tax assets which will be released as our hedges are settled 
if actual commodities prices realized remain higher than our hedged prices during  our resulting higher cash proceeds received on our production will offset any actual amounts paid out related to this liability 
we announced a redemption of million in principal on our senior notes in december the redemption occurred january   and the net redemption was million due to million of redeemed bonds already owned by a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
because we funded the redemption through our senior credit facility  there was no negative impact on our working capital position at december  due to the redemption 
our net working capital position at december  was a deficit of million 
on that date  we had available million under our senior bank credit facility 
several items contributed to the deficit in working capital  including a delay in obtaining million of sale and leaseback financing of offshore production platforms until january  the million loss we sustained as a result of the enron bankruptcy  and the postponement of negotiations for the expected million sale of certain assets  also a result of uncertainty in the marketplace caused by enron

magnum hunter s liquidity and capital resources 
the following discussion of magnum hunter s capital resources refers to the company and its affiliates other than bluebird and canvasback  whose capital resources were discussed separately above 
internally generated cash flow and the borrowing capacity under its senior bank credit line are our major sources of liquidity 
from time to time  we may also sell oil and gas properties in order to increase liquidity 
in addition  we may use other sources of capital  including the issuance of additional debt securities or equity securities  as sources to fund acquisitions or other specific needs 
in the past  we have accessed both public and private capital markets to provide liquidity for specific activities and general corporate purposes 
in december  magnum hunter used million in cash to purchase of its series a convertible preferred stock outstanding from bluebird 
this preferred stock was held by another owned affiliate for possible re issue at a later date 
also in december  we spent million including a million redemption premium to redeem of its outstanding series a convertible preferred stock 
in january  the remaining of this preferred stock was converted by the holder to our common stock at the conversion price of per share 
as a result of the redemption of its series a convertible preferred stock  we saved million in annual dividend payments 
in may  we reissued the million of its series a convertible preferred stock to bluebird in connection with the acquisition of bluebird s oil and gas properties 
we will make dividend payments of thousand annually to bluebird  however  such payments are eliminated under consolidated financial reporting 
on may   we closed on a new million senior bank credit facility  of which million was available under the borrowing base at december  the credit agreement provides for both libor and base rate prime interest rate options 
this new credit facility consolidated and replaced both magnum hunter s and bluebird s previous credit facilities 
at december   borrowings under this line were million  leaving availability of million on that date versus a deficit in working capital of million excluding bluebird 
as described below  we entered into several courses of action to remedy this working capital shortfall 
on a semiannual basis  the borrowing base is redetermined by the banks based on their review of our oil and gas reserves 
if the outstanding senior bank debt exceeds the redetermined borrowing base  we must repay the excess 
on december   we announced that a distribution of one warrant for every five shares of common stock owned on january  these warrants were distributed on march  each new warrant will entitle the holder to purchase one share of common stock at the warrants will expire three years from the date of distribution unless extended by the board of directors 
on january   we entered into a sale leaseback transaction on three newly constructed offshore production platforms and associated pipelines that were recently placed into service 
we received a total of million in new funding which was used for general corporate purposes including a voluntary reduction under our corporate bank revolving credit facility 
the production platforms are being leased from a syndicate group of lenders over a term of three years and at a cost of funds of approximately per annum  based on current interest rates 
this transaction is accounted for as a capital lease 
on march   we amended and restated our senior bank credit facility the facility in conjunction with the merger with prize 
the amended facility provided for total borrowings of million  up from million  and raised the borrowing base limit from million to million 
our facility includes covenants  the most restrictive of which requires maintenance a minimum funded debt to ebitda ratio  interest coverage ratio  and tangible net worth  as specified in the loan agreement 
we were not in compliance with the funded debt to ebitda ratio required under the covenants at march  the lender provided us with a waiver as of this date  and we negotiated a less restrictive funded debt to ebitda ratio for the next four successive quarters until march  we were in compliance with the covenants for the remainder of the year and expect to be able to comply with the revised covenants in the future

on january   magnum hunter used million in cash to redeem million in aggregate principal amount of our outstanding senior notes due at a redemption price of of par 
after the partial redemption  we have million of these notes outstanding 
we funded the redemption by borrowing from our facility 
our internally generated cash flow  results of operations  and financing for our operations are dependent on oil and gas prices 
to the extent that oil and gas prices decline  our earnings and cash flows may be adversely affected 
capital expenditures 
for the year ended december   our total capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment  exclusive of the prize merger  were million 
the following summarizes our capital expenditures by cost component in millions oil gas properties other unproved proved property total acquisition costs exploration costs development costs total for the year  we have budgeted approximately million for exploration and development activities 
we anticipate that the capital expenditure budget will be funded by cash flow from operations and credit facility utilization 
we are not contractually obligated to proceed with any of our material budgeted capital expenditures 
the amount and allocation of future capital expenditures will depend on a number of factors that are not entirely within our control or ability to forecast  including drilling results  oilfield costs  and changes in oil and gas prices 
as a result  actual capital expenditures may vary significantly from current expectations 
in the normal course of business  we review opportunities for the possible acquisition of oil and gas reserves and activities related thereto 
when potential acquisition opportunities are deemed consistent with our growth strategy  bids or offers in amounts and with terms acceptable to the company may be submitted 
it is uncertain whether any such bids or offers which we may submit from time to time will be acceptable to the sellers 
in the event of a future significant acquisition  we may require additional financing in connection therewith 
we do not budget for acquisition expenditures 
the following summarizes the oil and gas properties acquired in the prize merger in millions oil and gas properties other unproved proved property total acquisition costs     contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
we have the following contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years long term debt    capital leases     operating leases     total contractual obligations

the last of these guarantees expires in may  and we do not intend to issue any additional guarantees on behalf of ngts 
we have no other guarantees on behalf of any entities and do not intend to issue any at this time

all significant intercompany transactions and balances have been eliminated in consolidation

magnum hunter is a holding company with no significant assets or operations other than our investments in our subsidiaries 
our wholly owned subsidiaries  except for canvasback energy  inc canvasback  are direct guarantors of our senior notes and senior notes  and have fully and unconditionally guaranteed the notes on a joint and several basis 
the guarantors comprise all of the direct and indirect subsidiaries of the company other than canvasback  and we have presented separate condensed consolidating financial statements and other disclosures concerning each guarantor and canvasback see note to the consolidated financial statements 
there is no restriction on the ability of consolidated or unconsolidated subsidiaries  except for canvasback  to transfer funds to magnum hunter in the form of cash dividends and loans or advances 
oil and gas properties we use the full cost method of accounting for our investment in oil and gas properties 
under the full cost method of accounting  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of oil and gas proved reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool on a country by country basis as incurred  and properties in the pool are depleted and charged to operations using the unit of production method based on the ratio of current production to total proved oil and gas reserves  as determined by independent petroleum engineers 
to the extent that such capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization less deferred taxes exceed the pv of estimated future net cash flow from proved reserves of oil and gas  and the lower of unamortized cost or fair value of unproved properties after income tax effects  such excess costs are charged to operations 
once incurred  a write down of oil and gas properties is not reversible at a later date even if oil or gas prices subsequently increase 
our capitalized costs did not exceed the pv limitation using prices in effect at december  significant downward revisions of quantity estimates  declines in oil and gas prices  higher operating costs or additional capital costs which are not offset by incremental increases in oil and gas reserves or other factors could possibly result in write down for impairment of oil and gas properties in the future 
reserve engineering is a subjective process that is dependent on the quality of available data and on engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
reserve estimates are subject to change over time as additional information becomes available 
revenue recognition revenues are recognized when title to the product transfers to purchasers 
we follow the sales method of accounting for revenue for oil and natural gas production  so that we recognize sales revenue on all production sold to purchasers  regardless of whether the sales are proportionate to our ownership in the property 
a receivable or liability is recognized only to the extent that we have an imbalance on a specific property greater than the expected remaining proved reserves 
ultimate revenues from the sales of oil and gas production is not known with certainty until up to three months after production and title transfer occur 
current revenues are accrued based on our expectation of actual deliveries and actual prices received 
inflation and changes in prices our results of operations and cash flow have been  and will continue to be  affected by the volatility in oil and gas prices 
should we experience a significant increase in oil and gas prices that is sustained over a prolonged period  we would expect that there would also be a corresponding increase in oil and gas finding costs  lease acquisition costs  and operating expenses 
we market oil and gas for our own account  which exposes us to the attendant commodities risk 
a significant portion of our gas production is currently sold to a owned affiliate  ngts  llc  or end users either i on the spot market on a month to month basis at prevailing spot market prices or ii under long term contracts based on current spot market prices 
we normally sell our oil under month to month contracts to a variety of purchasers 
derivative instruments our product price and interest hedging activities are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
periodically we enter into derivative instruments such as futures  swaps and options contracts to reduce the adverse effects of fluctuations in natural gas and crude oil prices 
under our risk management policy  at inception  commodity hedge positions may not exceed of natural gas and of crude oil current forecasted months commodity production 
for non current greater than months commodity production  at inception  commodity hedge positions for natural gas and crude oil may not exceed 
we also utilize financial derivative instruments to hedge the risk associated with interest on our outstanding debt 
generally  the cash settlement of all derivative instruments is recognized as income or expense in the period in which the hedged transaction is recognized 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as extended by sfas no 
june and amended by sfas no 
june  beginning january  sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
it requires the recognition of derivatives in the balance sheet and the measurement of those instruments at fair value 
derivative instruments that are not hedges must be adjusted to the fair value through net income loss 
under the provisions of sfas  changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are fair value hedges are offset against changes in the fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments  through net income loss 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that are cash flow hedges are recognized in other comprehensive income loss until such time as the hedged items are recognized in net income loss 
ineffective portions of a derivative instrument s change in fair value are immediately recognized in net income loss 
goodwill as a result of our merger with prize  we currently have million of goodwill recorded on our books 
under sfas no 
 we will not amortize any of the goodwill acquired in the merger 
we will evaluate our goodwill for impairment on an annual basis or whenever indicators or impairment exist 
we have completed the first of these impairment tests and determined that no impairment exists 
the annual impairment test requires management to make significant estimates and judgments 
recently issued statements sfas no 
we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  beginning january  sfas no 
requires  among other things  the discontinuance of goodwill amortization 
any goodwill resulting from acquisitions completed after june  will not be amortized 
in addition  sfas no 
requires that we use a new method of testing goodwill that could reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we completed an impairment test at december  and determined that no adjustments for impairment were necessary 
any goodwill impairment loss will be recorded in operations 
we currently have goodwill of million as a result of our merger with prize energy corp 
on march  the adoption of sfas did not have an impact on our consolidated financial statements during sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  will be effective for us beginning january  sfas no 
requires the recognition of a fair value liability for any retirement obligation associated with long lived assets 
the offset to any liability recorded is added to the recorded asset where the additional amount is depreciated over the same period as the long lived asset for which the retirement obligation is established 
we have evaluated the impact of sfas and expect to record an after tax earnings effect between a thousand loss and a million gain as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
additionally  we expect to record an asset retirement obligation liability between million and million and to provide an increase to net properties and equipment between million and million 
the application of sfas in and future years will result in the recognition of an accretion expense related to the discounted liability for the asset retirement obligation and should not have a material impact on our dd a rate 
there will be no impact on our cash flow as a result of adopting sfas sfas no 
sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  was effective for us beginning january  sfas no

will require the reclassification of extraordinary items for debt extinguishment costs which do not meet the criteria described in apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  as to interest expense 
we adopted this statement beginning january  sfas in july  the fasb issued sfas accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas supercedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring

guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  was issued in november this interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees 
it also clarifies the requirements related to the recognition of a liability by a guarantor at the inception of a guarantee for the obligations the guarantor has undertaken in issuing that guarantee 
we adopted this statement in january we have provided additional disclosures on our existing guarantees 
the adoption had no impact on our financials at january  off balance sheet arrangements we have provided trade guarantees on behalf of our owned affiliate  ngts  llc 
in the amount of million 
in the event that ngts  llc is unable to fulfill its obligations with certain vendors  we would be obligated for cash payments of million to these vendors 
we have not recorded this as a liability on our books at december  because we do not expect to have to perform under these guarantees 
the last of these guarantees expires in may  and we do not intend to issue any additional guarantees on behalf of ngts 
we have no other guarantees on behalf of any entities and do not intend to issue any at this time 
we had equity and debt investments in a privately held entity which declared bankruptcy on march   and for which we recorded an impairment charge against earnings of million at december  we are not responsible for any debts of this entity 
we had an investment in available for sale securities of another entity of million at december  because of the deteriorating financial condition of this entity  we recorded an other than temporary impairment of million as a charge against earnings at december   and we recorded an additional impairment for the remaining carrying value of this asset at june  we are not responsible for any debts of this entity 
other at march   magnum hunter had of our natural gas production and of our crude oil production hedged through december   and of our natural gas production and of our crude oil production hedged for the calendar year unless we enter into additional hedging transactions  the remainder of our hydrocarbon volumes will be sold at market prices 
future commodity price declines will negatively impact future income and cash flow to the extent of any production sold at market prices 
these declines could ultimately affect the quantity of proved oil and gas reserves and cost center ceiling values 
these results  individually or collectively  could result in bank debt default and or debt acceleration  restrict our ability to attract qualified personnel or cause further industry consolidation 
there is no requirement from any of our lenders to hedge our products 
our domestic operations are concentrated in the southwestern and midcontinent regions of the united states and shallow water region of the gulf of mexico offshore texas and louisiana 
we currently have no operations outside of the united states of america 
we currently have nineteen wells which individually produce mmcfe per day or greater  but these are not concentrated in any one field 
we have no individual fields in which disruptions could materially reduce our financial results

energy swap agreements 
we produce  purchase  and sell crude oil  natural gas  condensate  and natural gas liquids 
as a result  our financial results can be significantly impacted as these commodity prices fluctuate widely in response to changing market forces 
we have previously engaged in oil and gas hedging activities and intend to continue to consider various hedging arrangements to realize commodity prices which we consider favorable and to reduce volatility 
we engage in futures contracts with certain of our oil and gas production through various contracts swap agreements 
the primary objective of these activities is to protect against significant decreases in price during the term of the hedge 
the swap agreements provide for separate contracts tied to the new york mercantile exchange nymex light sweet crude oil futures and henry hub natural gas futures  and to the inside ferc natural gas index price postings index 
we have contracts which contain specific contracted prices swaps that are settled monthly based on the differences between the contract prices and the specified index prices for each month applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent the index exceeds the contract price  we pay the spread  and to the extent the contract price exceeds the index price  we receive the spread 
in addition  we have combined contracts which have agreed upon price floors and ceilings costless collars 
when the index price exceeds the contract ceiling  we pay the spread between the ceiling and the index price applied to the related contract volumes 
when the contract floor exceeds the index  we receive the spread between the contract floor and the index price applied to the related contract volumes 
to the extent we receive the spread between the contract floor and the index price applied to related contract volumes  we have a credit risk in the event of nonperformance of the counterparty to the agreement 
we do not anticipate any material impact to our results of operations as a result of nonperformance by these counterparties 
due to hedge contracts acquired in the prize merger  the company is contractually obligated to a counter party to provide a margin deposit in the form of cash or bank letter of credit should the aggregate fair value of hedge contracts held with the counter party exceed a predetermined value 
margins posted at december  totaled million 
the company has not and does not intend to enter into any new hedging contracts with institutions that require margin deposits

the following table reflects the terms of these swaps 
type notional amount termination date pay rate receive rate pay fixed receive  fixed month variable libor rate currently the rate we receive will be reset every three months to exactly match the rate we will pay on million of our outstanding libor based bank debt 
based on future market prices at december   the fair value of our open interest rate swap contracts was a liability of million 
if future market rates were to increase or decrease from those in effect at december   the fair value of our open contracts would have an immaterial change and remain as a liability of million 
fixed and variable debt 
we use fixed and variable debt to partially finance budgeted expenditures 
these agreements expose us to market risk related to changes in interest rates
