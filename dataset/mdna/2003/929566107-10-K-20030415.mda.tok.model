risk factors investing in our securities involves a high degree of risk 
in addition to the other information contained in this form k  including the reports incorporated by reference  you should consider the following factors before investing in our securities we have limited capital resources 
our ability to access the capital markets is dependent on perceived current and future business prospects  as well as the company s current financial condition 
the company has experienced liquidity problems in the past and was in technical violation of its financial covenants with its lenders on february  for the reporting period ended january  the company received a waiver of the violation from its lenders and subsequently amended certain of its debt agreements in april this amendment changed debt maturities and principal payment schedules  increased the cost of funds  required the company to meet certain financial conditions and contains a subjective acceleration clause  which provides for an event of default upon the occurrence of a material adverse change  as defined in the agreements 
in addition  there can be no assurance that the company will have sufficient resources to meet its debt service requirements  working capital needs and capital resource requirements 
this amendment also contained provisions requiring the company to have a commitment letter to refinance  amend or restructure its debt and capital lease obligations prior to january  in order to avoid an event of default 
additionally  million of debt and capital lease obligations are scheduled to be due and payable during the first quarter of based upon the company s forecasted operating results for  it is unlikely that the company will be able to repay all of the debt and capital lease obligations due in from operations 
if the company is unable to comply with the terms of its new debt agreements or refinance existing obligations  it could be forced to further modify its operations or it may be unable to continue as a going concern  as the company s lenders could foreclose on its assets 
the ability to continue as a going concern is also dependent on the company s ability to manage the business to meet lender s financial requirements 
accordingly  the company has limited the availability and access to capital to fund future operations and expansions which could adversely affect the continuing operations of the company 
we face intense competition 
the truck trailer manufacturing industry is highly competitive 
we compete with other truck trailer manufacturers of varying sizes  some of which may have greater financial resources than we do 
barriers to entry in the truck trailer manufacturing industry are low  and therefore  it is possible that additional competitors could enter the market at any time 
certain participants in the industry in which we compete may have manufacturing over capacity and high leverage  and the industry has experienced a number of bankruptcies and financial stresses  all of which have resulted in significant pricing pressures 
our inability to compete effectively with existing or potential competitors would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our business is cyclical and has been adversely affected by an economic downturn 
the truck trailer manufacturing industry historically has been and is expected to continue to be cyclical as well as affected by overall economic conditions 
new trailer production for the trailer industry as a whole decreased to  in as compared to  units in and  units in and the current forecast for industry shipments in is approximately  units 
customers have historically replaced trailers in cycles that run from five to twelve years depending on service and trailer type 
poor economic conditions can adversely affect demand for new trailers and in the past have led to an overall aging of trailer fleets beyond this typical replacement cycle 
our business is likely to continue to be adversely affected unless economic conditions improve 
our technology and products may not achieve market acceptance 
we continue to introduce new products such as the duraplate r hd  and the freight pro commodity trailer 
there can be no assurance that these or other new products or technologies will achieve sustained market acceptance 
there can also be no assurance that new technologies or products introduced by competitors will not render our products obsolete or uncompetitive 
we have taken steps to protect our proprietary rights in these new products 
however  the steps we have taken to protect them may not be sufficient or may not be enforced by a court of law 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  other parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
if competitors are able to use our technology  our ability to compete effectively could be harmed 
we rely on the strength of our corporate partnerships and the success of our customers 
we have corporate partnering relationships with a number of customers where we supply the requirements of these customers 
to a significant extent  our success is dependent upon the continued strength of their relationships with us and the growth of our corporate partners 
our customers are often adversely affected by the same economic conditions that adversely affect us 
further  we often are unable to predict the level of demand for our products from these partners  or their timing of orders 
the loss of a significant customer or unexpected delays in product purchases could have a significant impact effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
some of our customers may be financially unstable 
some of our customers are highly leveraged and have limited access to capital 
therefore  their continued existence may be uncertain 
our financial condition may be affected by the financial stability of these customers 
we have a limited number of suppliers of raw materials and no guarantee of continued availability of raw materials 
we currently rely on a limited number of suppliers for certain key components in the manufacturing of truck trailers 
the loss of our suppliers or the inability of the suppliers to meet our price  quality  quantity and delivery requirements could have a significant impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we have a single manufacturing location 
our primary manufacturing operations are located in lafayette  indiana 
if the production in these facilities were unexpectedly disrupted for any length of time  it would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
used trailer values may decline 
used trailer values at any point in time are influenced by economic and industry conditions  as well as supply 
the company maintains inventories of used trailers  equipment held for lease  finance contracts secured by used trailers and has entered into residual guarantees and purchase commitments for used trailers as part of its normal business practices 
declines in the market value for used trailers or the need to dispose of excess inventories has had  and could in the future have  a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are subject to government regulations that may adversely affect our profitability 
the length  height  width  maximum weight capacity and other specifications of truck trailers are regulated by individual states 
the federal government also regulates certain safety features incorporated in the design of truck trailers 
changes or anticipation of changes in these regulations can have a material impact on our customers  may defer customer purchasing decisions  may result in reengineering and may affect our financial results 
in addition  we are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the transportation  storage  presence  use  disposal and handling of hazardous materials  discharge of stormwater and underground fuel storage tanks and may be subject to liability associated with operations of prior owners of acquired property 
if we are found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be successful in integrating businesses that we acquire into our business 
we have made and expect to make acquisitions of technology  businesses and product lines in the future 
our ability to expand successfully through acquisitions depends on many factors  including the successful identification and acquisition of products  technologies or businesses and management s ability to effectively integrate and operate the acquired products  technologies or businesses 
we may compete for acquisition opportunities with other companies that have significantly greater financial and management resources 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in acquiring or integrating any such products  technologies or businesses 
overview after a decline in demand during and a further decline of during  the trailer industry in the united states saw a third consecutive year of declines in demand during with overall new production of  units down slightly from  units in during this three year industry retrenchment  the company s market share of new trailers declined from in and in to during as a result of these conditions  the company implemented a comprehensive plan to scale its operations to meet demand and to survive  including o hiring of new management  o rationalizing manufacturing capacity  o reducing its cost structure through continuous improvement initiatives  o reducing used trailer inventories  o divesting international operations  o rationalizing retail and distribution capacity  and o improving working capital management

while the company believes that industry conditions are likely to rebound  the company believes it has significantly restructured its operations and  based on its projections  the company anticipates generating positive earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda in although the company believes that the assumptions underlying the projections are reasonable  there are risks related to market demand and sales in the us and canada  adverse interest rate or currency movements  realization of anticipated cost reductions and levels of used trailer trade ins that could cause actual results to differ from the projections 
should results continue to decline  the company is prepared to take additional cost cutting actions 
while there can be no assurance that the company will achieve these results  the company believes it has adequately modified its operations to be in compliance with its financial covenants throughout and believes that its existing sources of liquidity combined with its operating results will generate sufficient liquidity such that the company has the ability to meet its obligations as they become due throughout however  based upon debt maturities and the company s forecasted operating results for  it is unlikely that the company will be able to repay debt and capital lease obligations due in from operations

critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that directly affect the amounts reported in its consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and other assumptions that it believes to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
management continually evaluates the information used to make such estimates as its business and economic environment changes and has discussed these estimates with the audit committee of the board of directors 
the use of estimates is pervasive throughout the company s financial statements  but the accounting polices and estimates management considers most critical are as follows a 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue from the sale of trailers and aftermarket parts when the customer has made a fixed commitment to purchase the trailers for a fixed or determinable sales price  collection is reasonably assured under the company s normal billing and credit terms and ownership and all risks of loss have been transferred to the buyer  which is normally upon shipment or pick up by the customer 
b 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company records and maintains a provision for doubtful accounts for customers based upon a variety of factors including the company s historical experience  the length of time the receivable has been outstanding and the financial condition of the customer 
if the circumstances related to specific customers were to change  the company s estimates with respect to the collectibility of the related receivables could be further adjusted 
a change in the allowance for doubtful accounts would lead to an approximate million effect on our net loss before income taxes 
c 
inventories inventories are primarily stated at the lower of cost  determined on the first in  first out fifo method  or market 
the cost of manufactured inventory includes raw material  labor and overhead 
as used trailers approximate market value  a change in the market values of used trailer inventory would lead to an approximate million effect on our net loss before income taxes 
d 
asset impairment including long lived assets  goodwill and other intangible assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever facts and circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
specifically  this process involves comparing an asset s carrying value to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows the asset is expected to generate over its remaining life 
if this process were to result in the conclusion that the carrying value of a long lived asset would not be recoverable  a write down of the asset to fair value would be recorded through a charge to operations 
fair value is determined based upon discounted cash flows or appraisals as appropriate 
goodwill and other intangible assets are subject to periodic evaluations when circumstances warrant  or at least once a year  in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this evaluation involves the comparing of the carrying value of the goodwill or intangible assets to its fair value 
the fair value is estimated based upon the present value of future cash flows 
in estimating the future cash flows  the company takes into consideration the overall and industry economic conditions and trends  market risk of the company and historical information 
all of the factors involve a high degree of judgment and complexity and any changes in these factors could affect the carrying value of the assets in the future 
e 
accrued and contingent liabilities the company s warranty policy generally provides coverage for components of the trailers the company produces or assembles 
typically  the coverage period is five years 
the company s policy is to accrue the estimated cost of warranty coverage at the time of the sale 
a increase in warranty accruals would have increased total warranty provision by million in the company also has reserves for environmental and legal exposures 
the company s environmental reserves represent the estimated cost to remediate any known contamination at any of its current or formerly owned manufacturing or retail branch locations 
the reserve is evaluated quarterly to assess the range of potential clean up cost on a site by site basis based upon testing performed once an environmental issue has been identified 
the evaluation also takes into consideration any state or federal assistance with the remediation costs 
the company determines its necessary legal reserves based upon a probability of potential outcome 
a increase in these reserves would not have a significant impact on the total provision in f 
income taxes the company currently has a full valuation allowance equal to its net deferred tax assets based upon the realizability of those values 
the level of the company s net operating losses over the past three years  industry economic conditions and the financial struggles of the company have all affected the assessment of the company s ability to realize the assets in the future 
the company believes that its estimates for the valuation allowance reserved against deferred tax assets are appropriate based on current facts and circumstances 
a increase in the valuation allowance would result in a tax benefit of approximately million 
other inflation the company has generally been able to offset the impact of rising costs through productivity improvements as well as selective price increases 
as a result  inflation has not had  and is not expected to have a significant impact on the company s business

equipment off balance sheet and related customer credit risk the company subleased certain highly specialized roadrailer r equipment to amtrak  who is experiencing financial difficulties 
due to the highly specialized nature of the equipment  the recovery value of the equipment is considered to be minimal 
the unamortized lease value of this arrangement is approximately million as of december  the company also has finance contracts related to this customer recorded on its december  balance sheet of approximately million 
as of december   the customer was current in its obligations to the company 
as a result  the company has not recorded any provision for a loss on this equipment 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in addition to the risks inherent in its operations  the company has exposure to financial and market risk resulting from volatility in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
the following discussion provides additional detail regarding the company s exposure to these risks 
a 
commodity price risks the company is exposed to fluctuation in commodity prices through the purchase of raw materials that are processed from commodities such as aluminum  steel  wood and virgin plastic pellets 
given the historical volatility of certain commodity prices  this exposure can significantly impact product costs 
the company may manage aluminum price changes by entering into fixed price contracts with its suppliers upon a customer sales order being finalized 
because the company typically does not set prices for its products in advance of its commodity purchases  it can take into account the cost of the commodity in setting its prices for each order 
to the extent that the company is unable to offset the increased commodity costs in its product prices  the company s results would be materially and adversely affected 
b 
interest rates as of december   the company had approximately million of floating rate debt outstanding under its various financing agreements 
a hypothetical basis point increase in the floating interest rate from the current level would correspond to approximately a million increase in interest expense over a one year period 
this sensitivity analysis does not account for the change in the company s competitive environment indirectly related to the change in interest rates and the potential managerial action taken in response to these changes 
c 
foreign exchange rates the company is subject to fluctuations in the canadian dollar exchange rate and that impact on intercompany transactions between the company and its canadian subsidiary  as well as us denominated transactions between the canadian subsidiaries and unrelated parties 
since acquiring its canadian subsidiary  the company has not undertaken any activities  such as hedging activities  to mitigate this exposure 
therefore  exchange rate fluctuations could have a material impact on the results of operations 
the company also has historically entered into foreign currency forward contracts principally against the german deutschemark and french franc to hedge the net receivable payable position arising from trade sales including lease revenues and purchases with regard to the company s international activities 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes 
as of december   the company had no foreign currency forward contracts outstanding
