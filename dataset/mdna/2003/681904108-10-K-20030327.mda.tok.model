for the years ended december  total net sales    net income    earnings per share basic diluted ebitda a    a see five year summary of selected financial data for a reconciliation of ebitda to net cash flows from operating activities 
the company believes that certain investors find ebitda to be a useful tool for measuring a company s ability to service its debt  however  ebitda does not represent net cash flows from operating activities  as defined by us gaap  and should not be considered as a substitute for net earnings as an indicator of the company s operating performance or operating cash flows as a measure of liquidity 
the company s calculation of ebitda may differ from the calculation of ebitda by others 
the company adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred eitf no

consolidated total net sales for increased to  million from  million in diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december  versus in net income for was million versus million in ebitda for totaled million in comparison with million for included in and were aggregate charges of million and million pretax  respectively million and million aftertax  or and per diluted share  respectively  relating to the phase ii productivity and consolidation program described hereafter under restructuring and other related charges 
the charges were primarily comprised of employee severance pay  employment agreement buy out costs  lease termination costs  the write off of leasehold improvements and other assets  and professional fees and other facility exit costs 
included in the results are other expense items totaling million pretax million aftertax  or per diluted share 
specifically  in early  omnicare recorded a million pretax special charge representing a repayment to the medicare program of overpayments made to one of the company s pharmacy units during the period from january through april as part of its corporate compliance program  the company learned of the overpayments  which related to medicare part b claims that contained documentation errors  and notified the health care financing administration now known as the centers for medicare medicaid services for review and determination of the amount of overpayment 
further  the company recorded a million pretax special charge in mid  representing a settlement in june of certain contractual issues with a customer  which issues and amount relate to prior year periods 
pharmacy services segment omnicare s pharmacy services segment recorded sales of  million for the year ended december   exceeding the amount of  million by million  or 
at december   omnicare served long term care facilities comprising approximately  beds as compared with approximately  beds served at december  the increase in beds served was a result of the acquisition of american pharmaceutical services  inc and other related entities collectively  aps  as discussed below  and the efforts of the company s national sales marketing group and pharmacy staff to develop new contracts with long term care facilities 
the increase in sales relating to the aps acquisition approximated million 
additionally  pharmacy services sales increased due to the continued implementation and expansion of the company s clinical and other service programs  drug price inflation  and the increased market penetration of newer drugs  which often carry higher prices but are significantly more effective in reducing overall healthcare costs than those they replace 
lower government reimbursement formulas in some states partially offset the increase in pharmacy sales 
the company estimates that drug price inflation for its highest dollar volume products in was approximately 
operating profit of the pharmacy services segment was million in  an million improvement as compared with the million earned in as a percentage of the segment s sales  operating profit was in  compared with in the improved operating profit was primarily the result of increased sales  as discussed above  a lower operating cost structure reflecting principally the impact of the productivity and consolidation initiative started in the third quarter of the phase ii program  the overall synergies realized from the aps integration although margins were initially unfavorably impacted early in by the addition of the lower margin aps business  the exclusion of goodwill amortization in as previously discussed an expense that totaled million pretax in  the year to year million favorable impact of restructuring charges which totaled million pretax in compared with million pretax in  and other expense items in totaling million pretax 
improvement in operating performance in was also attributable to a more stable and gradually improving operating environment in the skilled nursing facility snf market  a result of enactment of the medicare  medicaid and schip balanced budget refinement act of bbra and the medicare  medicaid and schip benefits improvement and protection act of bipa 
however  certain payment increases provided under these acts expired on october  with no further action taken by congress to date 
the impact of these expirations on the company s customers did not result in a significant impact to omnicare in congress may consider these funding issues in  however  if no additional legislation is enacted  the loss of revenues associated with this occurrence could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the company s snf clients which could  in turn  adversely affect the timing or level of their payments to omnicare 
other healthcare funding issues remain  including pressures on federal and state medicaid budgets due to the economic downturn which has led to decreasing reimbursement rates in certain states 
while the company has managed to adjust to these pricing pressures to date  such pressures are likely to continue or escalate if economic recovery does not emerge and there can be no assurance that such occurrence will not have an adverse impact on the company s business 
in january  omnicare completed the acquisition of the assets comprising the pharmaceutical business of aps 
the acquisition  accounted for as a purchase business combination  included cash consideration and transaction costs which aggregated approximately million including an adjustment based on the closing balance sheet review 
up to an additional million in total deferred payments may become payable in annual increments of up to million each  contingent upon future performance  as evaluated in the first quarter of each of the next three years 
at the time of the acquisition  aps provided professional pharmacy and related consulting services to approximately  residents of skilled nursing and assisted living facilities through its network of pharmacies in states  as well as respiratory and medicare part b services for residents of long term care facilities 
the net assets and operating results of aps have been included in the company s financial statements beginning in the first quarter of on january   omnicare closed its per share cash tender offer for all of the issued and outstanding shares of class a common stock and class b common stock of ncs healthcare  inc ncs 
omnicare accepted  on january   all validly tendered shares for payment totaling  shares of class a common stock  representing approximately of the then outstanding class a common stock  and  shares of class b common stock  representing of the then outstanding class b common stock 
omincare subsequently acquired the remaining shares of class a common stock of ncs 
the acquisition of ncs  to be accounted for as a purchase business combination  included cash consideration and transaction costs of approximately million 
the cash consideration included the payoff of certain ncs debt totaling approximately million  which was retired by omnicare immediately following the acquisition 
the company financed the acquisition with available cash  working capital and borrowings under its three year  million revolving credit facility 
at the time of the acquisition  ncs provided professional pharmacy and related services to long term care facilities  including skilled nursing centers and assisted living facilities comprising approximately  beds in states and managed hospital pharmacies in states 
omnicare expects to achieve certain economies of scale and operational efficiencies from the acquisition  while broadening omnicare s geographical reach 
the net assets and operating results of ncs will be included from the date of acquisition in the company s financial statements beginning in the first quarter of cro services segment omnicare s cro services segment recorded revenues of million for the year ended december   which were million  or  greater than the million recorded in in accordance with eitf no 
 the company included million and million of reimbursable out of pockets in its cro services segment reported revenue and direct cost amounts for the years ended december  and  respectively 
despite volatility in revenues in the latter half of related to client driven delays or cancellations of certain projects  the increase in cro services revenue was achieved due to solid business gains arising from the efforts of the company s integrated global selling efforts and relative stability in the overall drug research market 
higher levels of demand were recognized from both major pharmaceutical manufacturers and biotechnology companies  and the company s expanding presence throughout the world 
operating income in the cro services segment was million in compared with million in as a percentage of the segment s revenue  operating profit was in compared with in the improvement in operating performance was attributable to the favorable impact of the aforementioned increase in revenues  the realization of benefits from the company s initiatives to integrate and streamline the organization  and the exclusion of goodwill amortization in which totaled million pretax in 
offsetting the improvement in operating performance was the million year to year impact of restructuring charges associated with the phase ii productivity and consolidation program  which totaled million pretax in compared with million in backlog at december  was million  representing a decrease of million from december  backlog of million due to projects moving out of backlog  as well as the cancellation of certain projects in consolidated the company s consolidated gross profit of million increased million in from the prior year amount of million 
gross profit as a percentage of total net sales of in the year ended december   was slightly lower than the experienced during positively impacting overall gross profit was the company s purchasing leverage associated with the procurement of pharmaceuticals  due in part to efforts in integrating the aps business and benefits realized from the company s formulary compliance program  as well as the leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs at the company s pharmacies through the reduced cost structure brought about by the phase ii program 
these favorable factors were offset primarily by the initial impact of the lower margin aps business and  to a lesser extent  the previously mentioned shift in mix towards newer  branded drugs which typically produce higher gross profit  but lower gross profit margins  and the effects of lower government reimbursement formulas in some states 
sales mix for the company also impacts gross profit and includes primarily sales of pharmaceuticals and  to a lesser extent  contract research services  infusion therapy products and services  medical supplies  and other miscellaneous products and services 
sales of pharmaceuticals account for the majority of the company s sales and gross profit 
contract research services and infusion therapy gross profits are typically higher than gross profits associated with sales of pharmaceuticals 
increased leverage in purchasing favorably impacts gross profit and is primarily derived through discounts from suppliers 
leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs primarily relates to generating higher sales volumes from pharmacy facilities with no increase in fixed costs eg  rent and minimal increases in variable costs eg  utilities  as well as the elimination of pharmacies through the company s productivity and consolidation initiatives  further discussed below 
the company believes it will be able to continue to leverage fixed and variable overhead costs through internal and acquired growth 
the company is generally able to obtain price increases to cover drug price inflation 
in order to enhance its gross profit margins  the company strategically allocates its resources to those activities that will increase internal sales growth and favorably impact sales mix  or will lower costs 
in addition  through the ongoing development of its pharmaceutical purchasing programs  the company is able to obtain discounts and thereby manage its pharmaceutical costs 
omnicare s selling  general and administrative operating expenses for the year ended december  of million were higher than the amount of million  by million  due to the overall growth of the business  including the acquisition of aps 
operating expenses as a percentage of total net sales  however  totaled in  representing a decline from the experienced in this decline is due to the year over year favorable impact of the phase ii program and the leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs over a larger sales base in than that which existed in investment income for the year ended december  was million  an improvement of million over the year 
larger average invested cash balances during as compared with  partially offset by the impact of lower interest rates in versus  was the primary driver of the slight increase in investment income 
interest expense during of million was relatively consistent with the comparable prior year amount of million 
the effective income tax rate was in  consistent with the prior year 
the effective tax rates in and are higher than the federal statutory rate largely as a result of the combined impact of state and local income taxes  various nondeductible expenses and tax accrual adjustments 
vs 
consolidated total net sales for increased to  million from  million in diluted earnings per share were for the year ended december  versus in net income for was million versus million in ebitda for was million in comparison to million for included in and were aggregate charges of million and million pretax million and million aftertax  or and per diluted share  respectively relating to certain productivity and consolidation programs described hereafter under restructuring and other related charges 
additionally  included in the period were other expense items totaling million pretax million aftertax  described in detail above 
pharmacy services segment omnicare s pharmacy services segment recorded sales of  million for the year ended december   exceeding the amount of  million by million  or 
the increase represents the continued internal growth of the pharmacy services business  due primarily to net growth in the number of nursing facility residents serviced  the expansion of clinical programs  and a favorable shift in the mix toward new  higher priced branded pharmaceuticals 
the growth in the number of residents serviced was generated through the efforts of the company s national sales marketing group and pharmacy staff in developing new pharmacy contracts with long term care facilities  net of the elimination of certain high credit risk or uneconomic accounts 
at december   omnicare served long term care facilities comprising approximately  beds as compared with approximately  beds served at december   a net increase during of  beds  which was nearly five times greater than the net increase experienced during the increasing market penetration of newer drugs  which often carry higher prices but are more effective in reducing overall healthcare costs than those they replace  also served to increase pharmacy services sales 
the company estimates that drug price inflation for its highest dollar volume products in was 
the factors favorably impacting sales growth in were offset in part by a decrease of million in infusion therapy sales as compared with  a result of the decrease in the number of higher acuity patients serviced 
operating profit of the pharmacy services segment was million in  a million improvement as compared with the million in as a percentage of the segment s sales  operating profit was in  compared to in the improved operating profit was primarily the result of increased sales  as discussed above  the million year to year favorable impact of restructuring charges associated with the productivity and consolidation programs  which totaled million pretax in the year compared with million pretax in  and a lower operating cost structure reflecting principally the full period impact of the productivity and consolidation initiative completed in the phase i program 
improvement in operating performance in was also attributable to a more stable and gradually improving operating environment in the skilled nursing facility market  a result of enactment of the bbra and the bipa 
during  many of the customers of the company s pharmacy services segment realized the benefits of higher statutory reimbursement rates in conjunction with the implementation of the bbra and bipa 
offsetting the improvement in operating profit were the million other expense items  discussed above 
cro services segment omnicare s cro services segment recorded revenues of million for the year ended december   which were million  or  greater than the million recorded in in accordance with eitf no 
 the company included million and million of reimbursable out of pockets in its cro services segment reported revenue and direct costs amounts for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase in cro services revenue was due to a recovery of the drug research market  as well as the efforts of the company s integrated global selling efforts 
higher levels of demand were recognized from both major pharmaceutical manufacturers and biotechnology companies  and the company s growing presence in the pacific rim countries contributed to the revenue increase 
operating profit of the cro services segment was million in compared with million in as a percentage of the segment s revenue  operating profit was in compared with in the improvement in operating performance was attributable to the favorable impact of the aforementioned increase in revenues  the overall stabilization of the drug research market following several large pharmaceutical company mergers in  as well as the realization of benefits from the company s initiatives to integrate and streamline the organization 
offsetting the improvement in operating performance was the million impact of restructuring charges associated with the phase i productivity and consolidation program  which totaled million pretax in the year compared with million pretax in consolidated the company s consolidated gross profit as a percentage of total net sales of in the year ended december  improved from the rate of experienced during  and represented a year over year increase in gross profit of approximately million to million 
positively impacting overall gross profit were the company s purchasing leverage associated with the procurement of pharmaceuticals and benefits realized from the company s formulary compliance program  as well as the leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs at the company s pharmacies and the full period impact of the reduced cost structure brought about by the phase i program completed in these favorable factors were offset in part by the previously mentioned shift in mix towards newer  branded drugs which typically produce higher gross profit  but lower gross profit margins 
omnicare s operating expenses for the year ended december  of million were higher than the amount of million  by million  due to the overall growth of the business 
operating expenses as a percentage of total net sales  however  totaled in  representing a decline from the experienced in this decline is primarily due to the full period favorable impact of the phase i program  which was successfully completed in late  the leveraging of fixed and variable overhead costs over a larger sales base in than that which existed in  and the integration and streamlining of the cro business 
investment income for the year ended december  was million  an improvement of million over the same period of larger average invested cash balances during as compared to was the primary driver of the increase in investment income 
interest expense during was million  an increase of million versus the comparable prior year period 
this increase was largely due to the impact of an increase in amortization of debt issuance costs classified as interest expense  relating to the first quarter debt transactions  partially offset by the reduction in outstanding debt  as discussed at the financial condition  liquidity and capital resources section below 
also unfavorably impacting interest expense was a marginal increase in the weighted average interest rates paid on outstanding debt brought about by the aforementioned debt transactions 
these transactions converted a substantial portion of the company s outstanding debt under revolving credit facilities  which are subject to variable rates of interest  to senior subordinated notes  which are subject to a higher  fixed rate of interest  but which also have a longer term 
the increase in the effective income tax rate to in from in the prior year is primarily attributable to the full utilization in of certain benefits derived from the company s state tax planning program 
while other state tax planning benefits will continue  they will be realized at a different magnitude than was the case in the effective tax rates in and are higher than the federal statutory rate largely as a result of the combined impact of various nondeductible expenses primarily intangible asset amortization and acquisition costs  state and local income taxes and tax accrual adjustments

however  the substantial portion of the company s operations and revenues and the substantial portion of the company s cash settlements are exchanged in us dollars 
therefore  changes in foreign currency exchange rates do not represent a substantial market risk exposure to the company 
the company does not have any financial instruments held for trading purposes  and does not hedge any of its market risks with derivative instruments 
critical accounting policies the preparation of the company s financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingencies 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates the estimates used  including those related to bad debts  contractual allowances  inventory valuation  impairment of goodwill  restructuring accruals  income taxes  pension obligations and other operating allowances and accruals 
management bases its estimates on historical experience  current conditions and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies involve more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition pharmacy services revenue is recognized when products or services are delivered or provided to the customer 
a significant portion of the company s revenues from sales of pharmaceutical and medical products is reimbursable from state medicaid and  to a lesser extent  the federal medicare programs 
the company monitors its revenues and receivables from these reimbursement sources  as well as other third party insurance payors  and records an estimated contractual allowance for certain sales and receivable balances 
accordingly  the total net sales and receivables reported in the company s financial statements are recorded at the amount ultimately expected to be received from these payors 
contractual allowances are adjusted to actual as cash is received and claims are settled 
the company evaluates several criteria in developing the estimated contractual allowances on a monthly basis  including historical trends based on actual claims paid  current contract and reimbursement terms and changes in customer base and payor product mix 
contract research services a portion of the company s revenues are earned by performing services under contracts with various pharmaceutical  biotechnology  medical device and diagnostics companies  based on contract terms 
most of the contracts provide for services to be performed on a units of service basis 
these contracts specifically identify the units of service and unit pricing 
under these contracts  revenue is generally recognized upon completion of the units of service  unless the units of service are performed over an extended period of time 
for extended units of service  revenue is recognized based on labor hours expended as a percentage of total labor hours expected to be expended 
for time and materials contracts  revenue is recognized at contractual hourly rates  and for fixed price contracts revenue is recognized using a method similar to that used for extended units of service 
the company s contracts provide for price renegotiations upon scope of work changes 
the company recognizes revenue related to these scope changes when underlying services are performed and realization is assured 
in a number of cases  clients are required to make termination payments in addition to payments for services already rendered 
any anticipated losses resulting from contract performance are charged to earnings in the period identified 
billings and payments are specified in each contract 
revenue recognized in excess of billings is classified as unbilled receivables  while billings in excess of revenue are classified as deferred revenue on the accompanying balance sheets 
in accordance with eitf no 
 the company has recorded reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses on a grossed up basis in the income statement as revenues and expenses  and has adjusted the prior year income statements to reflect the impact of eitf no 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company establishes the allowance for doubtful accounts based on historical credit losses and specifically identified credit risks 
management reviews this allowance on an ongoing basis for appropriateness 
factors considered in determining the adequacy of the allowance include current and expected economic conditions and each customer s payment history and creditworthiness 
judgment is used to assess the collectibility of account balances  and the creditworthiness of a customer 
given the company s experience  management believes that the reserves for potential losses are adequate  but if one or more of the company s larger customers were to default on its obligations  the company could be exposed to losses in excess of the provisions established 
if economic conditions worsen  impacting the company s customers ability to pay  management may adjust the allowance for doubtful accounts 
inventories the company maintains inventory at lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the basis of the first in  first out method 
there are no significant obsolescence reserves recorded since the company has not historically experienced nor does it expect to experience significant levels of inventory write offs 
omnicare uses a periodic inventory system 
physical inventories are typically performed on a monthly basis at all pharmacy sites  and in all cases at least once a quarter 
cost of goods sold is recorded based on the actual results of the physical inventory counts  and is estimated during those circumstances when a physical inventory is not performed in a particular month 
the company evaluates various criteria in developing estimated cost of goods sold during non inventory months  including the historical cost of goods sold trends based on prior physical inventory results  a review of cost of goods sold information reflecting current customer contract terms  and consideration and analysis of changes in customer base  product mix  payor mix  state medicaid and third party insurance reimbursement levels or other issues that may impact cost of goods sold 
actual cost of goods sold have not varied significantly from estimated amounts in non inventory months 
goodwill sfas requires that goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed for impairment using a fair value based approach upon adoption and at least annually thereafter 
sfas requires the company to assess whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired  and requires goodwill to be tested between annual tests if events occur or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
the company s assessments to date have indicated that goodwill has not been impaired 
events may occur in the future which could result in an impairment of the company s goodwill  and any resulting impairment charge could be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the assessment of goodwill impairment requires estimates of future cash flows 
to the extent the carrying value of the assets exceed their fair value  an impairment loss would be recorded 
changes in these estimates of future cash flows due to unforeseen events could affect the outcome of the company s impairment analysis 
restructuring programs the company has recorded accruals in connection with its restructuring programs  primarily for facility exit costs and involuntary termination benefits 
the accruals were established based on management s best estimate of the costs to be incurred  timing of payments and employee retention rates 
changes in these estimates or actual results could require the company to make adjustments to the recorded accruals 
management reviews these accruals on an on going basis for appropriateness 
employee benefit plans for certain of its employee benefit plans  the company estimates the expected return on plan assets  discount rate  rate of compensation increase and future healthcare costs  among other items  and relies on actuarial estimates  to assess the future potential liability and funding requirements 
these estimates  if assessed differently  could have an impact on the company s consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
however  a change in the discount rate used to calculate the company s pension obligations would not have a material impact to the company s operating results 
income taxes the company estimates its tax liabilities based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which it operates 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes  as well as about the realization of deferred tax assets 
if the provisions for current or deferred taxes are not adequate  if the company is unable to realize certain deferred tax assets or if the tax laws change unfavorably  the company could experience potential losses 
likewise  if provisions for current and deferred taxes are in excess of those eventually needed  if the company is able to realize additional deferred tax assets or if tax laws change favorably  the company could experience potential gains

outlook the company derives approximately one half of its revenues directly from government sources  principally state medicaid and to a lesser extent federal medicare programs  and one half from the private sector including individual residents  third party insurers and snfs 
in recent years  congress has passed a number of federal laws that have effected major changes in the healthcare system 
the balanced budget act of the bba sought to achieve a balanced federal budget by  among other things  changing the reimbursement policies applicable to various healthcare providers 
in a significant change for the snf industry  the bba provided for the introduction in of the prospective payment system pps for medicare eligible residents of snfs 
prior to pps  snfs under medicare received cost based reimbursement 
under pps  medicare pays snfs a fixed fee per patient per day based upon the acuity level of the resident  covering substantially all items and services furnished during a medicare covered stay  including pharmacy services 
pps resulted in a significant reduction of reimbursement to snfs 
admissions of medicare residents  particularly those requiring complex care  declined in many snfs due to concerns relating to the adequacy of reimbursement under pps 
this caused a weakness in medicare census leading to a significant reduction of overall occupancy in the snfs the company serves 
this decline in occupancy and acuity levels adversely impacted omnicare s results beginning in  as the company experienced lower utilization of omnicare services  coupled with pps related pricing pressure from omnicare s snf customers 
in and  congress sought to restore some of the reductions in reimbursement resulting from pps 
a bbra provision subsequently modified by bipa gave snfs a temporary rate increase for certain specific high acuity patients beginning april   and ending when the centers for medicare medicaid services cms implements a refined patient classification system under pps 
cms did not implement such refinements in fiscal year  and the bush administration has indicated that the refinements also will not be implemented in fiscal year  thus continuing the additional rate increases currently in place for certain high acuity patients 
bbra also included an overall across the board increase in payments otherwise determined under the bba for all patients for federal fiscal years and in  bipa further increased reimbursement by means of a temporary across the board increase in the nursing component of the federal rate for all patients for services furnished before october   and for fiscal year  a rate increase for all patients 
these provisions of the bbra and bipa helped to improve the financial condition of snfs  motivated them to increase admissions  particularly of higher acuity residents  and stabilized the unfavorable operating trends attributable to pps 
however  as noted  certain of the increases in medicare reimbursement for snfs provided for under the bbra and the bipa expired on october  with no further action taken by congress 
congress may consider these funding issues in if no legislation is enacted  the loss of revenues associated with this occurrence could have an adverse effect on the financial condition of the company s snf customers which  in turn  could adversely affect the timing or level of their payments to omnicare 
while it is hoped that congress will restore some or all of these reimbursement amounts  no assurances can be given as to whether congress will take such action in looking beyond the stabilization of medicare funding for skilled nursing facilities  other key healthcare funding issues remain  including the pressures on federal and state medicaid budgets arising from the economic downturn which has led to decreasing reimbursement rates in certain states 
while the company has managed to adjust to these pricing pressures to date  such pressures are likely to continue or escalate if economic recovery does not emerge and there can be no assurance that such occurrence will not have an adverse impact on the company s business 
longer term  funding for federal and state healthcare programs must consider the aging of the population and the growth in enrollees as eligibility is expanded  the escalation in drug costs owing to higher drug utilization among seniors and the introduction of new  more efficacious but also more expensive medications  the implementation of a medicare drug benefit for seniors  and the long term financing of the entire medicare program 
given competing national priorities  it remains difficult to predict the outcome and impact on the company of any changes in healthcare policy relating to the future funding of the medicare and medicaid programs 
demographic trends indicate that demand for long term care will increase well into the middle of this century as the elderly population grows significantly 
moreover  those over consume a disproportionately high level of healthcare services when compared with the under population 
there is widespread consensus that appropriate pharmaceutical care is generally considered the most cost effective form of treatment for the chronic ailments afflicting the elderly and also one which is able to improve the quality of life 
further  the pace and quality of new drug development is yielding many promising new drugs targeted at the diseases of the elderly 
these new drugs may be more expensive than older  less effective drug therapies due to rising research costs 
however  they are significantly more effective in curing or ameliorating illness and in lowering overall healthcare costs by reducing among other things  hospitalizations  physician visits  nursing time and lab tests 
these trends not only support long term growth for the geriatric pharmaceutical industry but also containment of healthcare costs and the well being of the nation s growing elderly population 
in order to fund this growing demand  the company anticipates that the government and the private sector will continue to review  assess and possibly alter healthcare delivery systems and payment methodologies 
while it is not possible to predict the effect of any further initiatives on omnicare s business  management believes that the company s expertise in geriatric pharmaceutical care and pharmaceutical cost management position omnicare to help meet the challenges of today s healthcare environment 
further  while volatility can occur from time to time in the contract research business owing to factors such as the success or failure of its clients compounds  the timing or budgeting constraints of its clients  or consolidation in the pharmaceutical industry  new drug discovery remains an important priority of pharmaceutical manufacturers that will be enhanced by the advances in science such as the mapping of the human genome 
pharmaceutical manufacturers  in order to optimize their research and development efforts  will continue to turn to contract research organizations to assist them in accelerating drug research development and commercialization
