overview backweb provides offline web infrastructure software and application specific software that enable companies to extend the reach of their web assets to the mobile community of their customers  partners and employees 
the company s products address the need of mobile users who are disconnected from a network to access and transact with critical enterprise web content and applications  such as sales tools  forecast management  contact lists  service repair guides  expense report updates  pricing data  time sheets  collaboration sessions  work orders and other essential documents and applications 
backweb proactiveportal tm is designed to extend the reach of corporate portals to mobile or disconnected users and users who need to be notified of critical new content  which helps increase usage of the portal and critical communications  which can increase companies return on investment from their enterprise portals 
our backweb e accelerator tm application allows an extended enterprise or geographically dispersed organization to manage and deliver pertinent information and alerts without the use of a portal 
this enables sales and service organizations  partners and resellers  and call centers using our products to collect and distribute up to date  key data to customers  partners  and employees  enabling users to interact with the data through alerts and notification features 
our core infrastructure software  backweb foundation tm  is a platform that allows organizations to efficiently target and deliver sizeable digital data of any format to users desktops throughout the extended enterprise 
since our inception  we have derived revenue primarily from licensing our products and  to a lesser extent  from maintenance  consulting and training services 
the rate of growth of our service revenue is not commensurate with the costs of service revenue such as salaries and related expenses of our customer support and consulting organizations and the cost of third party contractors to provide consulting services 
accordingly  our gross margins on service revenue are significantly lower than our gross margins on license revenue 
our products are marketed worldwide through a combination of the direct sales force  reseller channel and oems 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition  estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the trade receivable allowances for doubtful debts  reviewing goodwill  intellectual property and other intangible assets arising on capitalized purchased technology for impairment  review of equity investments for impairment  and forward exchange contracts revenue recognition we derive our revenue from licensing of our products  and by providing maintenance service  customer training and consulting services 
we generally sell our products through our direct sales force and  indirectly  
table of contents though resellers and oems 
as described below  management estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue we recognize in any accounting period 
we recognize software license revenue in accordance with statement of position software revenue recognition sop  as amended 
sop generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on the relative fair value of the elements 
we have also adopted sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions sop  for all transactions entered into after january  sop requires that revenue be recognized under the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements and no vsoe exists for the delivered elements 
we license our products on a perpetual and on a term basis 
we recognize license revenue arising from the sale of perpetual licenses and multi year term licenses in the accounting period that the official order form and sale occurs 
for term licenses with a contract period of less than one year  revenue arising is recognized on a monthly basis 
a license sale is deemed to have occurred when persuasive evidence exists of an agreement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable and the collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
delivery generally occurs when the product is delivered to a common carrier 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our license sale is fixed and determinable 
if the fee is not fixed or determinable  we recognize revenue as payments become due from the customer provided that all other revenue recognition criteria have been met 
we determine the fee associated with a license sale by reference to a price list  and if a discount from the price list is applicable  we assess whether the discount is in accordance with what management believes to be generally acceptable discount 
the principal factors we take into account when giving a discount are the volume of licenses in the transaction  the strategic nature of the deal and customer and the future likelihood of further transactions with the same customer 
in addition  we assess whether or not collection is reasonably assured 
our license agreements generally provide for payment within to days from the official order form date 
in cases where we do not establish reasonable assurance of collection  revenue is recognized only on the receipt of payment 
if we agree to payment terms that are outside of these parameters  we generally recognize revenue as the fees become due 
we assess the likelihood of collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history  the credit worthiness of the customer and  in some instances  a review of the customer s financial statements 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if credit worthiness cannot be established at the time the official order form is signed  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection is made  which is generally upon the receipt of cash 
for all sales made through our direct sales force  we use a software license service agreement slsa and an official order form 
for sales made through a reseller  we enter into a standard reseller agreement and evidence of orders from customers must be supplied before we recognize revenue 
we recognize maintenance revenue over the contractual period for the maintenance  which is generally one year 
we provide maintenance at multiple levels of support  and we price this service as a percentage of the related license revenue 
for those agreements where the maintenance and license is quoted as one fee  we value the maintenance as an undelivered element at standard rates and defer this revenue over the contractual maintenance period 
a customer may elect whether to buy a maintenance contract 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance 
however if such an acceptance provision exists  then we defer revenue recognition until we receive written acceptance of the product from the customer 
all agreements we enter into are non refundable and non cancelable 
we also recognize revenue from consulting activities  which is generally evidenced by a signed statement of work sow 
we generally charge for our consulting activities on a time and materials basis  and  in such cases  recognize revenue when we invoice the customer 
if an acceptance clause is contained in the sow  we defer revenue until we obtain written acceptance from the customer 
we also sometimes charge a 
table of contents fixed fee for our consulting activities 
management interprets fixed bids in a similar manner to a sow containing an acceptance clause and defers revenue recognition until the customer supplies a certificate of work completion  at which time we recognize the revenue 
we determine the appropriate revenue recognition for training to customers when we provide the customer with the training deferred revenue includes amounts billed to customers and cash received from customers for which revenue has not been recognized 
estimating valuation allowances and accrued liabilities  specifically the trade receivable allowance for doubtful debts management continually reviews the collectibility of trade accounts receivable and the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful debts against the trade accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes customer accounts  account receivable aging reports  history of bad debts and the business or industry sector to which they belong  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and any other pertinent factors 
generally  we make a provision for doubtful accounts when a trade receivable becomes days past due 
in exceptional cases  we will waive a provision after a trade receivable is days or more past due when in the judgment of management  after conducting due diligence with the management of the customer  the receivable is still collectible and the customer has demonstrated that payment is forthcoming 
during and  management provided for approximately  and million  respectively  of doubtful debts arising primarily from internet centric businesses in the business to consumer market that arose primarily as a result of certain customers no longer being able to continue business due to the prevailing economic conditions 
management is able to make reasonably objective judgments on the adequacy of other provisions relating to trade accruals 
we have not made any provision for contingent liabilities  which has involved significant management judgment that either we will prevail in the case of material litigation or that we have sufficient insurance to cover any adverse outcome 
in these cases management has accrued for the appropriate deductible in respect of the legal expenses in the financial statements 
a discussion of our outstanding material litigation is contained in part i  item legal proceedings of this form k 
reviewing goodwill  intellectual property and other intangible assets arising on capitalized purchased technology for impairment we assess the impairment of long lived assets and related goodwill  intellectual property and other intangibles whenever an event occurs that indicates that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
the factors we consider important in this assessment include  but are not limited to  the following significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our company  significant negative industry or economic trends 
the determination that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and goodwill arising on the purchase of intellectual property may not be recoverable is based upon the existence of one or more of the above factors 
we assess whether impairment exists by conducting an impairment review in which we compare the carrying value of the assets to their fair value in accordance with sfas as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  the company adopted sfas in january in conjunction with the restructuring we implemented during the third quarter of  which included a reduction in force of employees see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the company changed its internal allocation of resources 
the company now believes that it is unlikely that any future value will be realized from the wireless technology that was acquired from mobix 
as of june   the carrying value of the wireless technology  which was recorded as intangibles  was million 
based on sfas no 
 the company s intangible assets carrying value of million was in excess of its fair value of zero 
therefore  the company wrote off the million remaining carrying value of 
table of contents its intangible assets during the three months ended september  net intangible assets at december  were zero 
review of equity investments for impairment we have made equity investments in other companies that we believed were in the best interests of the company and its strategic objectives 
before an investment is executed  the company s executive management and board of directors approve them 
generally  management designates an executive staff member to either serve on the board of directors of the company in which we invested as a voting member or as an observer 
this process serves management to monitor the investment and to determine when an impairment review of the investment may be needed 
management performs a review of equity investments on a quarterly basis to determine if a provision for impairment is required 
this process  while based on reasonably objective evidence supplied by the company in which we invested  is combined with analysis of general economic trends and indicators 
during  management carried out such reviews and accounted for an impairment charge against one of its equity investments for the full million amount of the equity investment 
management reviews during demonstrated that no further impairment provisions were required against other equity investments 
significant management judgment is involved in conducting these reviews and future developments to this company may result in the impairment provision becoming a write off 
forward exchange contracts we participate in hedging certain forecasted committed expenses that are payable in new israeli shekels  or nis to minimize the company s exposure to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the nis and the us 
we compare budgeted nis exchange rates to the forward contract rates for the nis for various periods of time into the future where we are reasonable confident that we can forecast a stable stream of expenses payable in nis 
taking all industry specific and macro economic indicators into account  in order to protect ourselves from fluctuating exchange rates we enter into forward contacts 
the contracts are generally monthly and timed in the month to mature when we incur most of our expenses in nis  which are the payroll and related expenses 
we take out a number of forward contracts at a time for future months  depending on how confident we feel about both our forecasted nis expenses and our visibility into future exchange rate movement 
statement of financial accounting standard no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
requires that all derivatives be recorded on the balance sheet at fair value and such anticipated transactions are designated and documented at inception as cash flow hedges and are evaluated for effectiveness  at least quarterly 
if the derivative meets the definition of a hedge and is so designated  changes in the fair value of the derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
changes in the fair value of derivatives that are not designated  or are not effective as hedges  must be recognized in earnings 
all amounts accumulated in other comprehensive income at year end will be reclassified to earnings when the forecasted expense underlying the forward contract has been made 
results of operations revenue we derive revenue from license  maintenance  consulting and training services for backweb foundation  backweb e accelerator suite and backweb proactive portal 
total revenue for the twelve months ended december  was million  a decrease of approximately million  or  from million in the twelve months ended december  total revenue decreased approximately million  or  during as compared to the decrease in was due primarily to a million decrease in revenue from one oem customer  whose contract ended during we have negotiated a new reseller agreement with this customer and we are still in the business objective and strategy setting process 
we are not able to quantify the amount of revenue that may be generated in future periods from the new agreement 
the 
table of contents remaining million decrease was due to the decrease in the volume and average size of license and consulting service deals 
the decrease in was due to the decrease in the volume of both license and consulting services deals 
the company believes that these decreases in revenue during each of the last two years were due  in large part  to the continuing slowdown in companies information technology spending due to global economic conditions  and to a lesser extent the re positioning of the company to a new product offering of the backweb proactive portal 
we have limited visibility to forecast revenue for and therefore we are unable to quantify the future behavior of our revenue 
license revenue was million  or of total revenue  in the twelve months ended december  compared to million  or of total revenue  and million  or of total revenue  in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the million decrease in license revenue in as compared with was primarily due to the million decrease of license revenue from the oem customer whose contract terminated during  and the remaining million decrease was due to a decrease in the volume and average size of our license deals 
the million decrease in license revenue in as compared with was primarily due to a decrease in the volume and average size of our license deals 
during we have been transitioning to our new product  the backweb proactive portal 
our license revenue during has been largely dependent on our older products  especially the backweb foundation product 
during we expect the revenue from the backweb proactive portal to increase both in absolute terms and as a percentage of the overall product portfolio 
we expect too continue to generate license revenue from our older products  in particular the backweb foundation product but we expect this to decrease as a percentage of the overall product mix portfolio 
service revenue  which includes maintenance  consulting and training services  was million  or of total revenue  in the twelve months ended december  compared to million  or of total revenue  and million  or of total revenue  in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in service revenue was primarily related to the decrease in our maintenance revenue  which was directly attributable to the reduction in our license revenue  a decrease in professional consulting services revenue directly related to the volume reduction of license revenue deals and to a lesser extent a decrease in maintenance renewals due to global economic conditions 
in  and  one oem customer accounted for million  or of total revenue  million  or of total revenue  and million  or of total revenue  respectively 
in addition  two customers accounted for an aggregate of of total revenue in  and two customers accounted for an aggregate of of total revenue in we expect that a small number of customers will continue to account for a substantial portion of our total revenue for the foreseeable future and revenue from one or more of these customers may represent more than of our total revenue in future years 
customers outside of the united states accounted for  and of our total revenue in the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
the variations in the mix of revenue generated in the united states as compared to the revenue generated outside of the united states fluctuates significantly due to the reduced number of deals closed in these periods  as each individual deal had a greater impact on the composition of our revenue and the significant variability in the value of these deals 
to a lesser extent the overall increase from to and the decline from to of revenue generated outside of the united states was also attributable to the geographical distribution of revenue that was associated with the oem agreement that ended during cost of revenue cost of revenue was million  or of total revenue  for the twelve months ended december  compared to million  or of total revenue  and million  or of total revenue  for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
in and  the increase in cost of revenue was due to a shift in the revenue produced from the higher gross margin license deals to the lower gross margin service revenue deals 
the decrease in cost of revenue in absolute dollars was primarily due to the reduction in run rate expenses as a result of both the and restructuring that was undertaken 
the 
table of contents expenses affected by the restructuring were across the board  including  but not limited to payroll and related expenses and general overhead expenses of the company 
cost of license revenue consists primarily of expenses related to media duplication  packaging of products and royalty payables to oem vendors 
cost of license revenue was  or of license revenue  for the twelve months ended december  compared to  or of license revenue  for the twelve months ended december  and  or of license revenue  for the twelve months ended december  the cost of license revenue is higher in percentage terms in the twelve months ended december compared to the twelve months ended december  and due to the fixed cost elements of the royalty payables for embedded third party software 
cost of service revenue consists primarily of expenses related to salaries and the overhead of our customer support and professional service organizations  including related expenses of backweb consultants  third party consultants and contractors 
cost of service revenue was million  or of service revenue  in the twelve months ended december  compared to million  or of service revenue  in the twelve months ended december  and million  or of service revenue  in the twelve months ended december  the decrease in cost of service revenue in and was primarily due to the reduced level of payroll and related expenses together with overhead expenses that resulted from the reorganizations that occurred in both and we expect the cost of service revenue to increase marginally in line with service revenues  the increase is not directly variable due to the relative fixed cost of the customer technical support operation 
operating expenses research and development  net research and development expenses  net consist of personnel costs  equipment and supply costs for our development efforts 
we charge these expenses to operations as they are incurred 
we have research and development facilities in israel 
research and development expenses  net were million  million and million for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in research and development expenses  net during was primarily due to the reduction in our headcount from to full time employees that resulted from the reduction in force we implemented on october  our research and development expenses  net also decreased in due to more effective cost management and the restructuring of the underlying fixed cost element  principally the office lease costs in israel  following the reorganization 
other influential factors are the devaluation of the nis against the us dollar and the credit resulting from cash flow hedging under forward exchange contracts of approximately  the increase in research and development expenses  net during was partly due to a  research and development grant that we received in which was credited against operational expenses and substantial investment in research and development personnel and related costs towards the end of  which peaked during the first six months of we were not entitled to receive any research and development grant in this was partially offset by the reduction in research and development costs following the reduction in force we implemented on july   although there was some underlying investment and growth remaining after the reorganization 
research and development expenses  net were  and of total revenue in the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in research and development expenses  net as a percentage of revenue during each of the last two years was due to a larger percentage decrease in total revenue as compared with research and development  net expenses 
we expect our research and development  net expenses will decrease on an absolute basis in due to the restructuring that we carried out in and more effective cost management 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist of personnel and related costs for our direct sales force  product management  marketing  business development and operations management employees  together with the costs of marketing programs  including trade shows and other related direct expense and general overhead 
as of december   we had sales personnel in offices located in the united states and europe 
sales and 
table of contents marketing expenses were million  million and million for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing expenses during each of the last two years was due to numerous factors  one of which was the reduced level of headcount and related costs as a result of the reorganizations that occurred in both and we reduced the sales and marketing organization in the october reorganization from to full time employees 
other significant factors were lower commission earned which is directly related to the lower levels of revenue and reduced advertising and marketing program expense as well as underlying fixed overhead 
sales and marketing expenses were  and of total revenue for the twelve months ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenue during each of the last two years was due to a larger percentage decrease in total revenue as compared with sales and marketing expenses 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will decrease on an absolute basis during as a consequence of the reorganization that took place in this reduction may be partially offset by increased commissions earned to the extent revenue levels increase over those of general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs and outside services for general corporate functions  including finance  accounting  general management  human resources  information services  legal and the provision for bad and doubtful debts 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in the twelve months ended december    and  respectively 
excluding the provision for bad and doubtful debt of  million and  in the twelve months ended december   and  respectively  general and administrative expenses were million  million  and million 
the decrease in general and administrative expenses during  excluding the provision for bad and doubtful debts  was primarily decreased payroll and related expense as well as reductions in underlying fixed overhead following the reduction in our headcount from to full time employees  resulting from the reorganization in we expect general and administrative expenses  excluding the provision for bad and doubtful debts  will decrease on an absolute basis over the next year due to the reorganization and more effective cost management 
during and  our provision for bad and doubtful debts were primarily attributable to internet centric businesses in the business to consumer market  as worsening economic conditions caused certain customers to no longer be able to continue business 
we do not expect to have increased provisions for bad and doubtful debt during restructuring charge during the three months ended september   the company announced a restructuring plan  which it implemented in the three months ended december  the restructuring plan included reducing the workforce by employees  vacating some facilities  canceling office service leases and writing down fixed assets as a result of employee terminations and office consolidation 
during the three month period ended september   we recorded a restructuring charge of million  which included million of severance and benefit costs  million of facility costs   related to the write down of fixed assets and  related to other restructuring costs

table of contents write off of intellectual property and other intangible assets in conjunction with the company s restructuring that it implemented during  the company changed its internal allocation of resources 
as of june   the company believed that it was unlikely that any future value would be realized from the wireless technology that it acquired from mobix communications ltd 
this wireless technology was recorded as intangibles on june  and had a carrying value of million as of june  based on sfas in the critical accounting policies  the company s intangible assets carrying value of million was in excess of its fair value of zero 
therefore  the company wrote off the million remaining carrying value of these intangibles during the three months ended september  amortization of goodwill  intellectual property  other intangible assets and deferred stock compensation consists of amortization of goodwill and other intangibles associated with our acquisition of lanacom in august  deferred stock compensation in  the initial write off of the acquisition of intellectual property from mobix communications ltd 
in june and amortization of intellectual property and other intangibles associated with the acquisition of intellectual property from mobix 
deferred stock compensation represents the aggregate differences between the respective exercise price of options at their dates of grant and the deemed fair market value of our ordinary shares for accounting purposes 
goodwill  intellectual property and other intangibles are being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life  generally two to three years 
deferred stock compensation is presented as a reduction of shareholders equity and is amortized over the vesting period of the underlying options based on an accelerated vesting method 
the total amortization expense related to a one time write off of in process research and development in june was million 
amortization expense was million for the twelve months ended december  compared to million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
finance and other income  net finance and other income  net includes interest income earned on our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments offset by interest expense and the effects of exchange gains and losses arising from the re measurement of transactions in foreign currencies 
for the twelve months ended december   finance and other income and expenses  net was million compared to million and million in the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
the decrease in finance and other income  net during and was due to the decrease in our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments due to our operating losses and reduced interest rates 
the increase in finance and other income during was due to interest income generated from the proceeds of our initial public offering in july we expect finance and other income  net to continue to decrease during as the company forecasts that it will continue to use cash during and  as a result  the company expects to earn less investment and interest income 
write down of an equity investment in  the company invested an aggregate of million in certain development stage companies operating internet centric businesses in which the company believed it had a significant strategic interest 
however  due to the economic slowdown and the significant decline in capital available to  and in the valuations of  the privately funded internet centric businesses  the company determined that its investment in path  inc had become impaired 
accordingly  in the three months ended june   the company recorded a charge of million to reflect impairment of these assets below their recorded cost to represent what the company s management considered to be fair value 
no impairment charge was recorded during the year ended december  income taxes as of december   we had approximately million of israeli net operating loss carry forwards and million of us federal net operating losses carry forwards available to offset future taxable income 

table of contents the us net operating loss carry forwards expires in varying amounts between the years and the israeli net operating loss carry forwards have no expiration date 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   the company had million of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments as compared to million as of december  net cash used in operating activities was million and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   and primarily represents the net proceeds from the purchases and sales of short term investments 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the twelve months ended december   and primarily represents the net proceeds from the purchases and sales of short term investments  partially offset by the purchase of property and equipment 
cash provided by financing activities was  and million for the twelve months ended december  and  respectively  and consisted primarily of proceeds from the issuance of ordinary shares and proceeds from shareholders note receivables 
as of december   the company had no material commitments for capital expenditures 
our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing  marketing  selling and supporting our products and the timing and extent of establishing additional operations 
we believe that our current cash balances will be sufficient to fund our operations for at least the next months from the date of this report 
however  we might need to raise additional funds prior to the expiration of this period if we are not successful in generating significant revenue from our products  particularly from licensing the proactiveportal server  if we fail to develop key strategic relationships or if our operating expenses exceed our expectations 
if we were required to raise additional funds  it could be difficult to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  if at all 
we may try to obtain additional financing by issuing ordinary shares or debt securities  which could dilute our existing shareholders 
if we cannot raise needed funds on acceptable terms  or at all  we may not be able to develop or enhance our products  respond to competitive pressures or grow our business 
backweb leases its office facilities under cancelable and non cancelable operating leases 
future rental payments on a fiscal year basis under non cancelable operating leases with initial terms in excess of one year are as follows in thousands and after as part of the restructuring plan that began in the three months ended september   the company entered into negotiations with its various landlords to renegotiate its lease obligations 
the company has reached agreement in principle with its landlords in san jose  ca and ramat gan  israel whereby it may be able to mitigate its lease obligations by  among other things buying out certain of its obligations  subletting space or reducing rent or a combination of these 
the amounts reflected in the table above assume that the agreements in principle are reflective of the final executed agreements 
effective corporate tax rates our tax rate reflects a mix of the us statutory tax rate on our us income  versus european country tax rates on our individual european country income and the israeli tax rate discussed below 
we expect that most of our taxable income will be generated in israel 
israeli companies are generally subject to income tax at a rate of of taxable income 
the majority of our income  however  is derived from our capital investment 
table of contents program with approved enterprise status under the law for the encouragement of capital investments  and is eligible therefore for tax benefits 
as a result of these benefits  we expect to have a tax exemption on income derived during the first two years in which this investment program produces taxable income  provided that we do not distribute such income as a dividend  and a reduced tax rate of for the following to years  depending upon the proportion of foreign ownership of the company 
all of these tax benefits are subject to various conditions and restrictions 
see note income taxes israeli income taxes tax benefits under the law for the encouragement of capital investments  we cannot assure you that we will obtain approval for additional approved enterprise programs  or that the provisions of the law will not change 
since we have incurred tax losses through december   we have not yet used the tax benefits for which we are eligible 
see item  business risk factors 
impact of inflation and currency fluctuations most of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
however  we incur a large portion of our costs from our operations in israel 
a substantial portion of our operating expenses  primarily our research and development costs  are denominated in nis 
costs not denominated in us dollars are translated to us dollars  when recorded  at prevailing rates of exchange 
this is done for the purposes of our financial statements and reporting 
costs not denominated in us dollars will increase if the rate of inflation in israel exceeds the devaluation of the israeli currency as compared to the us dollar or if the timing of such devaluations lags considerably behind inflation 
consequently  we are  and will be  affected by changes in the prevailing nis us dollar exchange rate 
we might also be affected by the us dollar exchange rate to the major european currencies due to the fact that we do business in europe 
the annual rate of inflation in israel was  in  in and in the nis was devalued against the us dollar by approximately in  in and in the representative dollar exchange rate for converting the nis to us dollars  as reported by the bank of israel  was nis for one us dollar on december  recently issued accounting pronouncements the fasb recently issued sfas no

sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and replaces emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas improves financial reporting by requiring that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  adoption of sfas is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position or operating results 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transmission and disclosure  which amended fasb statement no 
sfas 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  sfas has been adopted and the additional disclosure requirements have been reflected in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in israel and sell them in us  canada  europe and israel 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
as most of our sales are currently made in us dollars  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
we regularly assess these risks and have established policies and business practices to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
as a result  the company does not anticipate material losses in these areas 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required
