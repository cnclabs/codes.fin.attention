critical accounting policies and significant estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
as such  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that they believe are reasonable based on the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management believes are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating the company s reported financial results include sales allowances  inventory valuation  recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  recoverability of royalty advances and commitments and pensions 
sales allowances for customer promotions  discounts and returns are recorded as a reduction of revenue from product sales when the related revenue is recognized 
revenue from product sales is recognized upon the passing of title to the customer  at the time of shipment 
revenue from product sales  less related sales allowances  is added to royalty revenue and reflected as net revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
the company routinely commits to promotional allowance programs with customers 
these allowances primarily relate to fixed programs  which the customer earns based on purchases of company products during the year 
discounts are recorded as a reduction of related revenue at the time of sale 
while many of the allowances are based on fixed amounts  certain of the allowances  such as the returns allowance  are based on market data  historical trends and information from customers and are therefore subject to estimation 
inventory is valued at the lower of cost or market 
based upon a consideration of quantities on hand  actual and projected sales volume  anticipated product selling price and product lines planned to be discontinued  slow moving and obsolete inventory is written down to its net realizable value 
failure to accurately predict and respond to consumer demand could result in the company underproducing popular items or overproducing less popular items 
management estimates are monitored on a quarterly basis and a further adjustment to reduce inventory to its net realizable value is recorded when deemed necessary under the lower of cost or market standard 
on december   the first day of fiscal  the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which eliminates the amortization of goodwill  as well as amortization of intangible assets deemed to have an indefinite life 
under this statement  goodwill and intangible assets are allocated to applicable reporting units 
goodwill and other intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are tested for impairment annually 
goodwill is tested using a two step process that begins with an estimation of the fair value of the reporting unit using an income approach  which looks to the present value of expected future cash flows 
the first step is a screen for potential impairment while the second step measures the amount of impairment if there is an indication from the first step that one exists 
intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested for impairment by comparing their carrying value to their estimated fair value also calculated using the income approach 
in connection with the adoption of sfas  the company recorded an impairment charge of  net of tax  primarily as the result of the change in goodwill impairment criteria from an undiscounted to a discounted cash flow method 
the company s annual impairment test was performed in the fourth quarter of and no impairment was indicated 
at december   the company has goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives of  recorded on the balance sheet 
intangible assets  other than those with indefinite lives  are reviewed for indications of impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
recoverability of these intangible assets is measured by a comparison of the assets carrying value to the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets were considered to be impaired  the impairment would be measured by the amount by which the carrying value of the asset exceeds its fair value based on estimated discounted cash flows 
the preparation of future cash flows requires significant judgments and estimates with respect to future revenues related to the respective asset and the future cash outlays related to those revenues 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in anticipated revenues and related cash flows could result in a change in this assessment and result in an impairment charge 
the preparation of discounted cash flows also requires the selection of an appropriate discount rate 
the use of different assumptions would increase or decrease estimated discounted cash flows and could increase or decrease the related impairment charge 
intangible assets covered under this policy were  at december  the recoverability of royalty advances and contractual obligations with respect to minimum guaranteed royalties is assessed by comparing the remaining minimum guaranty to the estimated future sales forecasts and related cash flow projections to be derived from the related product 
if sales forecasts and related cash flows from the particular product do not support the recoverability of the remaining minimum guaranty or  if the company decides to discontinue a product line with royalty advances or commitments  a charge to write off the remaining minimum guaranty is required 
the preparation of revenue forecasts and related cash flows for these products requires judgments and estimates 
actual revenues and related cash flows or changes in the assessment of anticipated revenues and cash flows related to these products could result in a change to the assessment of recoverability of remaining minimum guaranteed royalties 
at december   the company had  of prepaid royalties   of which are included in prepaid expenses and other current assets and  which are included in other assets 
the company  except for certain international subsidiaries  has pension plans covering substantially all of its full time employees 
pension expense is based on actuarial computations of current and future benefits using estimates for expected return on assets  expected salary increases  and applicable discount rates 
the company estimates expected return on assets using a weighted average rate based on historical market data for the investment classes of assets held by the plan  the allocation of plan assets among those investment classes  and the current economic environment 
based on this information and  in light of recent decreases in historical average market returns  the company reduced its expected return on plan assets in to versus used in and a decrease in the estimate used for expected return on plan assets would increase pension expense while an increase in this estimate would decrease pension expense 
expected salary increases are estimated using a combination of historical salary increases with expected salary increases in the company s long term business forecasts 
based on this analysis  the company reduced expected salary increases in to from used in and increases in estimated salary increases would increase pension expense while decreases would decrease pension expense 
discount rates are selected based upon rates of return on high quality fixed income investments currently available and expected to be available during the period to maturity of the pension benefits 
the company considers moody s long term aa corporate bond yield at the measurement date as an appropriate guide in setting this rate 
at september   the company s measurement date for its pension assets and liabilities  the moody s long term corporate bond yield was  and the company selected a discount rate of 
a decrease in the discount rate would result in greater pension expense while an increase in the discount rate would decrease pension expense 
primarily as the result of the changes in these assumptions  the company expects its pension expense in to increase by approximately  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of a certain corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
assets in the plan are valued on the basis of their fair market value on the measurement date 
in  the company recorded a minimum pension liability of  this amount represents the amount by which the accumulated benefit obligation exceeds the sum of the fair market value of plan assets and accrued amounts previously recorded 
the company does not expect the changes in assumptions to impact its funding requirements in contractual obligations and commercial commitments in the normal course of its business  the company enters into contracts related to obtaining rights to produce product under license  which may require the payment of minimum guarantees  as well as contracts related to the leasing of facilities and equipment 
in addition  the company has  of long term debt  including current installments and excluding fair value adjustments  outstanding at december  future payments required under these and other obligations are as follows payments due by fiscal year certain contractual obligations thereafter total long term debt  including current installments    operating lease commitments      future minimum guaranteed contractual royalty payments   purchase commitments   certain of the future minimum guaranteed contractual royalty payments are contingent upon theatrical release of the related entertainment property

results of operations may be affected primarily by changes in the value of the us dollar versus the hong kong dollar  euro  british pound  canadian dollar and mexican peso and  to a lesser extent  other currencies  including those in latin american countries 
to manage this exposure  the company has hedged a portion of its estimated upcoming fiscal year foreign currency transactions  first and foremost by using forward foreign exchange contracts and  to a lesser extent  zero cost option collars 
from time to time  the company may also hedge foreign currency exposure using purchased foreign currency options 
the company estimates that a hypothetical immediate unfavorable movement in the us dollar could result in an approximate million decrease in the fair value of these instruments 
the company is also exposed to foreign currency risk with respect to its net cash and cash equivalents or short term borrowing positions in other than the us dollar 
the company believes  however  that the on going risk on the net exposure should not be material to its financial condition 
in addition  the company s revenues and costs have been and will likely continue to be affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
the company does not speculate in  and  other than set forth above  the company does not hedge foreign currencies 
the company reflects all derivatives at their fair value as an asset or liability on the balance sheet 
at december   the company had fixed rate long term debt  including current installments  of  the company entered into several interest rate swap agreements in  with a total notional amount of  to adjust the amount of long term debt subject to fixed interest rates 
the interest rate swaps are matched with specific long term debt obligations 
these interest rate swaps are being accounted for as fair value hedges of the underlying debt 
changes in interest rates affect the fair value of fixed rate debt not hedged by interest rate swap agreements while affecting the earnings and cash flows of the long term debt hedged by the interest rate swaps 
the company estimates that a hypothetical one percentage point decrease or increase in interest rates would increase or decrease the fair value of this long term debt by approximately  or  respectively

in the past year certain customers in the retail sector have experienced economic difficulty 
the company monitors the creditworthiness of its customers and adjusts credit policies and limits as it deems appropriate 
the company s revenue pattern continues to show the second half of the year being more significant to its overall business 
the trend of retailers over the past few years has been to make a higher percentage of their purchases within or close to the fourth quarter holiday consumer selling season  which includes christmas 
to the extent that retailers do not sell as much of their year end inventory purchases during this holiday selling season as they had anticipated  their demand for additional product earlier in the following fiscal year may be curtailed  thus negatively impacting the company s revenues 
in addition  the bankruptcy or other lack of success of one of the company s significant retailers could negatively impact the company s future revenues 
the effect of inflation on the company s operations during was not significant and the company will continue its policy of monitoring costs and adjusting prices  accordingly
