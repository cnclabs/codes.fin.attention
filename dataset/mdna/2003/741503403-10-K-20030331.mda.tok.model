item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  including the notes to those statements  included elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and the lead in immediately preceding part i of this annual report on form k 
as discussed in more detail in the lead in immediately preceding part i of this annual report on form k  this discussion contains forward looking statements which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results may differ materially from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause those differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors that may affect future results 
overview we have pioneered a unique e commerce pricing system known as a demand collection system that enables consumers to use the internet to save money on products and services while enabling sellers to generate incremental revenue 
using a simple and compelling consumer proposition name your own price r we collect consumer demand  in the form of individual customer offers  for a particular product or service at a price set by the customer 
we then access databases or  in some instances  communicate that demand to participating sellers to determine whether we can fulfill the customer s offer 
for most of these transactions  we establish the price we will accept  have total discretion in supplier selection  purchase and take title to the particular product and are the merchant of record 
consumers agree to hold their offers open for a specified period of time and  once fulfilled  offers generally cannot be canceled 
we benefit consumers by enabling them to save money  while at the same time benefiting sellers by providing them with an effective revenue management tool capable of identifying and capturing incremental revenues 
by requiring consumers to be flexible with respect to brands  sellers and product features  we enable sellers to generate incremental revenue without disrupting their existing distribution channels or retail pricing structures 
our business model and brand are currently  through us or independent licensees  supporting several products and service offerings  including the following leisure airline tickets  provided by domestic and international airline participants  and travel insurance  hotel rooms  in substantially all major united states markets with more than national hotel chains  and in a limited number of markets outside the united states  rental cars  in substantially all major united states airport markets with five leading rental car chains as participants  home financing services  in substantially all major united states markets  which includes home mortgage services  home equity loans and refinancing services  fixed price cruises and cruise packages  through a third party that accesses major cruise lines  and vacation packages  in many united states and certain international markets 
in certain instances  we have licensed the priceline 
com name and demand collection system to third parties to offer a particular product or service home financing or to offer a number of products or services in a distinct international region asia 
pursuant to these licensee transactions  we generally receive a royalty under the license and may also receive fees for services and reimbursement of certain expenses 
we also hold a significant percentage of equity in such entities 
in the days following the commencement of the military conflict with iraq on march   we experienced a substantial decline in demand for our travel products and an increase in customer service costs and ticket refunds and cancellations 
at this time  we cannot forecast the extent to which our travel business will be affected by the war with iraq 
however  a prolonged conflict could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
see factors that may affect future results our business has been negatively impacted by the war in iraq and could be further damaged by terrorist attacks or the fear of future terrorist attacks 
our overall financial prospects are significantly dependent upon our sale of leisure airline tickets and  as a result  the health of our business is directly related to the health of the airline industry 
the domestic airline industry has experienced significant revenue declines since the beginning of and most domestic airlines  and many of our major suppliers  are experiencing significant losses which we expect to be worsened by the war in iraq 
if the major airlines are unable to stem these losses  additional bankruptcy filings by major airlines are likely 
see factors that may affect future results the bankruptcy  discontinuance or consolidation of our suppliers could harm our business 
since the terrorist attacks of september   and  more recently  following the outbreak of war with iraq  the major airlines have grounded portions of their fleets  significantly reducing the number of available airline seats  and have deeply discounted retail airline tickets to stimulate demand 
these actions have had a detrimental effect on our business 
deep retail discounting by the airlines affects our demand and our bind rate the percentage of unique offers that we ultimately fulfill by hurting our value proposition and making users less willing to accept the trade offs associated with our opaque leisure airline tickets 
in addition  decreased airline capacity hurts our business by reducing the levels of inventory available to us and increasing our cost of inventory 
while we did not see a deterioration in average offer price from customers during  offer prices have not kept pace with the increase in our cost of inventory and are  therefore  lower in proportion to our average cost of supply  negatively affecting our bind rate 
we believe that over time  our lower bind rate may also negatively impact demand for our airline tickets 
the war in iraq  lingering effects of september   continued aggressive discounting by the airlines  competition from other on line distribution channels and low cost carriers  and uncertainty regarding our domestic economy and additional or protracted hostilities in the middle east or elsewhere  we believe have  and may continue to  negatively impact our airline ticket demand into as a result  near term forecasting is very difficult and we are not currently forecasting a recovery in the airline industry or an improvement during in our airline ticketing business 
another important trend in our industry is the growing number of travel providers competing for share in the online travel market 
consumers have accepted the idea that the internet is an important tool in researching travel plans and destinations and a secure  convenient and cost effective way to make travel reservations 
as a result  the number of companies focusing on and exclusively providing these services is growing 
as competition in this marketplace has increased  and continues to do so  we have seen  and expect to continue to see  downward margin pressure 
see factors that may affect future results intense competition could reduce our market share and harm our financial performance 
we intend to combat these trends by continuing to develop our non air business  in particular our hotel business  for which demand and bind remains relatively strong  continuing to evaluate and implement ways to improve offer quality and our bind rate  diversifying our revenue among non opaque products such as retail travel products offered through our wholly owned subsidiary  lowestfare 
com and broadening our customer appeal through marketing efforts relating to both priceline 
com and lowestfare 
com 
however  further terrorist attacks  hostilities in the middle east  the insolvency of a major domestic airline now in bankruptcy  the bankruptcy of an additional carrier or the withdrawal from our system of a major airline or hotel supplier could adversely affect our business and results of operations 
a number of travel suppliers  particularly airlines  have indicated publicly that  as part of an effort to reduce distribution costs  they intend to reduce their dependence over time on what they view to be expensive distribution channels such as global distribution systems gdss 
a number of travel suppliers have reached agreements with travel distributors that require rebates of all or part of the fees received from the gds 
additionally  travel suppliers are encouraging distributors  such as us  to develop technology enabling direct connections therefore bypassing the gds 
development of direct connection technology would require the use of information technology resources and could cause us to incur additional operating expenses and delay other projects 
we have been and believe that we will continue to be under pressure from travel suppliers to rebate all or part of the travel booking fees we receive from worldspan  lp to the extent that we are required to rebate travel booking fees we currently receive from our gds to travel suppliers  and are unable to recover such amounts by charging customers  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  in march  a corporation newly formed by citigroup venture capital equity partners lp and teachers merchant bank  agreed to purchase worldspan  lp from its airline owners 
it is unclear what effect  if any  a change in control of worldspan  lp will have on our relationship with worldspan  lp or our business  results of operations or financial condition 
several other important developments occurred during the year ended december  on february   we launched our vacation packages product 
utilizing our name your own price r system  our vacation packages product allows travelers to choose the specific hotel they want  how long they want to stay  the days on which they want to leave and come back and  the price they want to pay for their vacation 
as with our airline product  the specific airline and flight times are not disclosed to the consumer in the vacation packages product 
we believe that the internet is a good medium for delivery of the content and information customers desire when making a vacation decision and that the build your own vacation concept will appeal to a broad segment of the leisure travel purchasing population that was previously uninterested in purchasing package products 
on may   we entered into an agreement with lowestfare 
com  llc whereby we purchased the trademarks and domain names of lowestfare 
com 
we believe that lowestfare 
com is one of the internet s strongest discount travel brands 
we began offering  and will continue to offer  airline tickets  hotel rooms  rental cars and vacation packages at prices disclosed to the consumer  through the www 
lowestfare 
com internet site 
we believe that lowestfare 
com will help us diversify our revenue stream and broaden our customer appeal by making us less dependent on the opaque channel and offering our customers a retail alternative 
on july   we announced that our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million of our common stock from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
in addition  we announced that cheung kong holdings limited and hutchison whampoa limited  who together own approximately of our outstanding common stock  had informed us that they may purchase up to an additional million of priceline 
com common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as of december   we had repurchased  shares of our common stock as part of our stock repurchase program 
whether and when we decide to complete any purchase of common stock and the amount of common stock purchased will be determined by us in our complete discretion 
any repurchase by us may or may not occur simultaneously or be coordinated with any purchases of common stock by cheung kong holdings limited and hutchison whampoa limited 
as of december   there were approximately million shares of our common stock outstanding 
on august   us airways group  inc announced that it had filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code 
on december   ual corp  the parent company of united airlines  announced that it and certain of its us subsidiaries also filed for protection under chapter of the bankruptcy code 
in their announcements  us airways and united airlines each stated that it had adequate resources to fulfill its obligations to customers while it reorganizes its operations and that tickets on us airways and united would continue to be honored and accepted 
our five largest airline suppliers  united airlines  us airways  delta air lines  american airlines  and continental airlines  together accounted for approximately of our airline ticket revenue in the year ended december  currently  two of our largest suppliers  us airways and united airlines  account for roughly half of our business and are operating under the protection of the federal bankruptcy laws 
while we do not expect the bankruptcy filings of us airways or united airlines to have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations over the near term  we are unable at this time to assess the long term impact of these bankruptcy filings on our business 
if any of our five largest airline suppliers were unable or unwilling to participate in our system  as a result of bankruptcy  voluntary withdrawal  or otherwise  our business and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
see factors that may affect future results we are dependent on the airline industry and certain airlines 
on november   we announced a repositioning of our non travel businesses and a reduction in headcount  each of which caused a reduction in related expenses 
our car service continues to provide new and used car buying information and guaranteed quote requests  but no longer provides a name your own price r service  and our telecommunications service continues to offer long distance calling plans  but no longer sells name your own price r calling minutes 
the repositioning was designed to reduce operating expenses and focus resources on our travel businesses 
as part of the repositioning  we reduced our workforce by positions 
in connection with the reduction in force and the restructuring of our non travel businesses  we recorded a charge in the fourth quarter of approximately million  consisting primarily of severance costs 
on november   our board of directors announced the promotion of jeffery h 
boyd to president and chief executive officer 
mr 
boyd was our president and had shared the chief executive officer responsibilities with chairman richard s 
braddock 
mr 
braddock will continue as our non executive chairman 
on january   we announced the appointment of howard w 
skip barker  jr 
to our board of directors 
mr 
barker replaced general atlantic partners  llc partner william e 
ford  who retired from our board 
mr 
barker will also serve as chairman of the audit committee of the board of directors 
we believe that our success will depend in large part on our ability to achieve and maintain profitability  primarily from our travel business  to continue to promote the priceline 
com brand and  over time  to offer other travel products and services on our website 
we intend to continue to invest in marketing and promotion  technology and personnel within parameters consistent with attempts to improve operating results 
our goal is to reduce operating losses and improve gross margins in an effort to achieve and maintain profitability 
our limited operating history and the uncertain competitive environment described above makes the prediction of future results of operations difficult  and accordingly  we cannot assure you that we will maintain revenue growth or achieve and maintain profitability 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our accounting policies are particularly important to the portrayal of our financial position and results of operations and require us to make significant judgments 
in applying those policies  our management uses its judgment to determine the appropriate assumptions to be used in the determination of certain estimates 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to credit card charge backs and refunds  investments in licensees  intangible assets  income and other taxes  restructuring  special charges and severance  and contingencies and litigation 
those estimates are based on historical experience  terms of existing contracts  our observance of trends in the travel industry and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
our actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
our significant accounting policies include refunds 
in limited circumstances  we make certain accommodations for customers or provide refunds to customers 
based on our historical experience and our contractual arrangements with our suppliers  we establish reserves for estimated losses resulting from refunds or cancellations 
in the event that we experience either an unanticipated increase in refunds or cancellations  as we did in the weeks following the terrorist attacks of september   or our suppliers refuse to accept certain refunds or cancellations or challenge refunds granted outside of their policies  our costs of revenues could increase 
allowance for credit card charge back 
because we are the merchant of record on most of our transactions  we are responsible for credit card transactions on our website that are disputed by customers with their credit card companies including disputes involving fraudulent transactions 
accordingly  we record an allowance based on our historical charge back experience for estimated losses resulting from credit card charge backs 
investment in equity interests 
in september  we converted a debt instrument into a equity interest in pricelinemortgage and  accordingly  recognized our pro rata share of pricelinemortgage s net income 
at december   the investment in pricelinemortgage consisted of our original investment of million and our cumulative share of pricelinemortgage s earnings of approximately million  offset by an impairment charge of approximately million which is included in the equity and net income of pricelinemortgage line of our statement of operations to reflect the write down of the carrying value to its estimated fair value 
robert j 
mylod  our chief financial officer  is a director of  and an investor in  alliance capital partners inc  the parent company of alliance partners  lp  the owner of of pricelinemortgage 
in  mr 
mylod invested  in alliance capital partners inc and his investment represents less than of one percent of alliance capital partners inc s outstanding common stock 
valuation of long lived assets 
we evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred which indicate that the carrying amounts of long lived assets may be impaired or not recoverable 
the significant factors that are considered that could trigger an impairment review include changes in business strategy  market conditions  or the manner of use of an asset  under performance relative to historical or expected future operating results  and negative industry or economic trends 
in evaluating an asset for possible impairment  management estimates that asset s future undiscounted cash flows to measure whether the asset is recoverable 
if it is determined that the asset is not recoverable  we measure the impairment based on the projected discounted cash flows of the asset over its remaining life 
while we believe that our estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  different assumptions regarding such cash flows could materially affect these evaluations 
net operating losses 
we recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the net deferred tax asset at december  and representing the portion of tax operating loss carryforwards and other items for which it is more likely than not that the benefit of such items will not be realized 
such valuation allowance increased by approximately million for the year ended december  and increased by approximately million for the year ended december  at december  we had approximately billion of net operating loss carryforwards for income tax purposes expiring from december  to december   which are subject to limitation on future utilization under section of the internal revenue code of section imposes limitations on the availability of a company s net operating losses after a more than percentage point ownership change occurs 
as a result of the completion and revision of a detailed and complex study the nol study  it was determined that ownership changes occurred in and the amount of our net operating losses incurred prior to each ownership change is limited the loss limitation based on the value of the company on the respective dates of ownership change 
it is estimated that the effect of section will reduce the amount of net operating loss which is available to offset future taxable income to approximately million annually 
the estimate of the annual loss limitation is based upon certain conclusions in the nol study pertaining to the dates of the ownership changes and the value of the company on the dates of the ownership changes 
the overall determination of the loss limitation and conclusions contained in the nol study are subject to interpretation  and therefore  the annual loss limitation could be subject to change 
presentation of revenues 
revenues are primarily recognized  if and when  we accept and fulfill a customer s offer 
transaction revenue  which represents a substantial majority of our overall revenues  primarily represents the selling price of airline tickets  hotel rooms  rental cars and long distance phone service 
for these transactions  we establish the price we will accept  have total discretion in supplier selection  purchase and take title to the particular product and are the merchant of record 
we record as revenue the amount received from the customer  net of taxes  surcharges and other fees 
fee revenue consists of worldspan  lp booking fees  customer processing fees and commissions related to retail travel sales  and other fees related to sales made through our own site or a third party 
we record these fees as revenue  at the net amount we receive  with no associated cost of revenue 
uncertainty regarding state taxes 
we file tax returns in such states as required by law based on principles applicable to traditional businesses 
in addition  we pay sales and other taxes to suppliers on our purchases of travel services sold through the priceline 
com service 
in certain cases  where appropriate  we remit taxes directly to the tax authorities 
we believe that this practice is consistent with the tax laws of all jurisdictions 
however  one or more states could seek to impose additional income tax obligations  sales tax collection obligations  or other tax obligations on companies  such as ours  which engage in or facilitate online commerce 
a number of proposals have been made at state and local levels that could impose such taxes on the sale of products and services through the internet or the income derived from such sales 
to the extent that any tax authority succeeds in asserting that a tax collection responsibility applies to transactions conducted through the priceline 
com service  we might have additional tax exposure 
such actions could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we will continue to assess the risks of any potential financial impact  and to the extent appropriate  we will reserve for those contingencies 
valuation of goodwill 
we account for goodwill in connection with our investment in priceline 
com europe 
we performed the initial and final steps of the transitional impairment test in in connection with our adoption of statements of financial accounting no 
there was no impairment resulting from the transitional impairment test  however  subsequent impairment losses were determined and reflected in operating loss in our consolidated financial statements 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
recent developments on march   we announced that lowestfare 
com  our wholly owned subsidiary  had entered into a distribution agreement with travelweb llc 
travelweb llc is a full service automated hotel distribution network owned by marriott  hilton  hyatt  six continents  starwood hotels and pegasus solutions 
under the terms of the agreement  travelweb llc will become the exclusive provider of published price  net rate inventory in the us and canada that will be available on both lowestfare 
com and on priceline 
com 
in connection with the distribution agreement  lowestfare 
com made an million investment in travelweb llc and received approximately of the equity of travelweb llc and a seat on travelweb llc s board of directors 
on march   we announced that  in connection with the renewal of a marketing agreement with marriott international  inc  we issued marriott five million warrants to purchase shares of our common stock 
the warrants  which are not transferable  are fully vested and will be exercisable no earlier than three years from the date of issuance subject to certain limited exceptions in the event of a reorganization  recapitalization  merger or consolidation involving priceline 
com 
the exercise price of the warrants will be the closing price of our common stock at a pre determined date in the future 
in connection with the issuance of the warrants  we will record a charge in the first quarter of of approximately to per share

travel revenues travel revenues for the twelve months ended december  and consisted primarily of transaction revenues representing the selling price of airline tickets  hotel rooms and rental cars  ancillary fees  including worldspan  lp reservation booking fees  and customer processing fees charged in connection with the sale of airline tickets  hotel rooms and rental cars 
during the twelve months ended december   we sold approximately million  million and million airline tickets  hotel room nights and rental car days  respectively 
during the twelve months ended december   we sold approximately million  million and million airline tickets  hotel room nights and rental car days  respectively 
we believe that the approximately decrease in the number of airline tickets sold in the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  was due primarily to the weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us 
in particular  we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the tradeoff associated with our products in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates  to purchase travel products at the lower retail rates or from low cost carriers without having to make any trade offs 
in addition  many airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september   thus decreasing capacity on existing flights  which we believe reduced airline inventory available to us 
our bind rate is the percentage of unique offers that we ultimately fulfill 
our bind rate for all unique airline ticket  hotel room and rental car offers were as follows airline hotel rental tickets rooms cars year ended december  year ended december  we believe that our travel revenues and bind rate have been negatively impacted by the weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us 
in particular  we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the tradeoff associated with our products in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates  to purchase travel products at the lower retail rates or from low cost carriers without having to make any trade offs 
in addition  many airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september   thus decreasing capacity on existing flights  which we believe reduced airline inventory available to us 
these trends  which negatively impacted our revenues and bind rate in the fourth quarter of  and throughout and are expected to continue into we added approximately million new customers during the twelve months ended december   compared to approximately million during in addition  we generated approximately million repeat customer offers during the twelve months ended december   compared to approximately million for the same period last year 
travel revenues for the twelve months ended december  decreased approximately to million from approximately billion for the twelve months ended december   primarily as a result of the weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us

in addition  many airlines grounded portions of their fleets in the aftermath of the terrorist attacks of september   thus decreasing capacity on existing flights  which we believe reduced airline inventory available to us 
ancillary fee revenues for the twelve months ended december  decreased from the same period a year ago as a result of a decrease in worldspan  lp reservation booking fees and customer processing fees in the airline and rental car services 
the average revenue per total booked travel offer decreased to in the twelve months ended december  from in the twelve months ended december  we believe that this decline in the average revenue per total booked travel offer was primarily driven by a change in the mix of our travel services sold 
specifically  revenues from our hotel and rental car businesses  which  on average  have a lower transaction value  grew as a percentage of total travel revenue in as compared to travel revenues  particularly airlines tickets  continue to account for the majority of our revenue 
seasonal variations in our travel business have historically and are expected to continue to impact our travel revenues 
the following table represents the percentage of total travel revenue by quarter year ended december  year ended december  first second third fourth first second third fourth quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter quarter travel revenue other revenues other revenues during the twelve months ended december  and consisted primarily of transaction revenues and fees from our long distance phone service  which we repositioned in  commissions and fees from our home financing and automobile services  license fees from our international licensees  and marketing revenues

cost of travel revenues for the twelve months ended december   decreased primarily due to a decrease in sales of airline tickets 
cost of other revenues

we are able to manage the level of gross margins by controlling the price at which we will cause offers to be fulfilled 
for the twelve months ended december   travel gross profit and related travel gross margin decreased from the same period in  primarily due to the weak retail environment for airline tickets and reduced airline inventory available to us 
in particular  we believe that lower retail pricing causes customers who might normally be willing to make the tradeoff associated with our products in exchange for savings off of higher retail rates  to purchase travel products at the lower retail rates or from low cost carriers without having to make any trade offs

advertising expenses consist primarily of television and radio advertising  online and email advertisements  and agency fees  creative talent and production costs for television and radio commercials 
for the twelve months ended december   advertising expenses decreased over the same period in primarily due to the decrease in television advertising  which was partially offset by an increase in online and radio advertising 
during  sales and marketing expenses benefited from the resolution of promotional and agency obligations  of approximately million  offset entirely by additional advertising expenditures 
the net result of these items did not have a material impact on either the total sales and marketing expense or the total operating results 
in the first half of  we shifted some of our marketing resources from traditional areas of marketing such as television and radio  toward lower cost online marketing and in the latter half of  we began to focus again on television and radio advertising 
while we intend to continue to promote the priceline 
com brand aggressively in and to focus the majority of our marketing resources on our hotel product  we expect to reduce our advertising expenditures in the near term as a result of the recent outbreak of hostilities in the middle east 
other sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of credit card processing fees  provisions for credit card charge backs  fees paid to third party service providers that operate our call centers  and compensation for our sales and marketing personnel 
for the twelve months ended december   other sales and marketing expenses decreased over the same period in due to a reduction in the absolute amount of credit card charge backs and a related million decrease in the allowance for charge backs  as well as a reduction in variable expenses driven by lower unit volume 
general and administrative year ended december  change general administrative   payroll tax expense on employee stock options stock based compensation   total   of revenues general and administrative expenses consist primarily of costs for personnel  occupancy expenses  telecommunications costs  and fees for outside professionals 
general and administrative expenses increased slightly during the twelve months ended december  over the same period in primarily as a result of an increase in our directors and officers insurance premium  and an increase in costs due to the consolidation of our european operations 
for the twelve months ended december   we recorded charges of approximately  for payroll taxes relating to options exercised in accordance with our employee stock option plans 
for the twelve months ended december   payroll taxes relating to the exercise of employee stock options were  stock based compensation decreased over the same period in as a result of the completion of the amortization of restricted stock 
in the fourth quarter of  we accelerated the vesting of restricted stock held by certain employees based on the anticipated achievements of earnings performance targets established at the time of grant fourth quarter of 
as a result of the acceleration of the vesting of the restricted stock  we recorded a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter in addition  in connection with the accelerated vesting of restricted stock  we paid the tax withholding liability associated with the vesting of such shares  including amounts in excess of the minimum statutory tax withholding  by withholding from delivery to certain employees shares of stock and  as a result  recorded a non cash charge of approximately million 
systems and business development year ended december  change systems business development   of revenues systems and business development expenses consist primarily of compensation to our information technology and product development staff  depreciation and amortization on computer hardware and software  payments to outside contractors  and data communications and other expenses associated with operating our internet site 
for the twelve months ended december   systems and business development expenses remained relatively the same as the same period in during  systems and business development expenses were impacted by favorable resolution of certain data center  telecom and contract programming obligations 
in the absence of such adjustments systems and business development expenses would have been approximately higher than the amount recorded during restructuring  severance  and special charges in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million 
this restructuring charge resulted from the repositioning of our non travel businesses and a reduction in headcount 
the repositioning was designed to reduce operating expenses and focus resources on our travel business 
the charge relates primarily to severance payments  real estate costs and asset impairments 
as a result of the fourth quarter restructuring  our work force was reduced by full time employees at our norwalk location and full time employees at our europe location 
the employee termination costs primarily represent severance payments and related benefits 
the real estate costs primarily represent the estimated net lease expense related to space we decided we no longer needed  and which we will not utilize in the future along with certain required refurbishments to that space 
asset impairments are comprised of abandoned equipment and software projects  and software costs related to our plans not to pursue certain product offerings and activities 
other restructuring charges include professional and other fees and costs incurred in associated with the restructuring activities

schulman s employment agreement 
we also accelerated  pursuant to the terms of mr

during and  we decreased the liability for the restructuring charge by approximately million and million  respectively 
these reductions resulted from cash payments and the favorable resolution of certain matters  primarily the collection of certain receivables and the settlement of real estate commitments  and were reflected as an adjustment to the restructuring charge reversal line on our consolidated statements of operations 
we estimate  based on current available information  the remaining net cash outflows associated with our restructuring related commitments will be as follows in thousands expected to be paid in employee termination costs  real estate costs  other total  restructuring related liabilities due within months and due after months are classified in accrued expenses and in long term accrued expenses  respectively  on our consolidated balance sheets

our rental car service was not launched until the first quarter we believe that the approximately decrease in the number of airline tickets sold in the twelve months ended december  compared to the twelve months ended december  was due primarily to the significant decline in the demand for airline tickets following the september  terrorist attacks 
the demand for airline tickets recovered in the weeks following the september  attacks 
however  that recovery was slowed  in part  by disruptions in the availability of inventory related to anticipated schedule changes by the airlines

the average revenue per total booked travel offer decreased to in the twelve months ended december  from in the twelve months ended december  we believe that this decline in the average revenue per total booked travel offer was primarily driven by a change in the mix of our travel services sold 
specifically  revenues from our hotel and rental car businesses grew as a percentage of total travel revenue in as compared to however  the average price of an airline ticket booked on priceline 
com decreased approximately compared to primarily as a result of a drop in average offer prices caused by a decline in consumer expectations for the cost of travel as a result of retail fare wars and the events of september  adaptive marketing revenues for the year ended december  were approximately million

consistent with our strategy of increasing our gross margins  for the twelve months ended december   travel gross profit and related travel gross margin increased over the same period in as a result of increased transactional sales volume and increased worldspan  lp reservation booking and customer processing fee revenues

the real estate costs primarily represent the estimated net lease expense related to space we decided we no longer needed and which we will not utilize in the future along with certain required refurbishments to that space 
some of these leases run through as part of the restructuring  we chose to abandon our plan to open a new network operations center in that leased space 
this decision accounted for a significant portion of the real estate costs and a portion of the asset impairment  as previously capitalized costs were expensed

because we collect cash up front from our customers and then pay our suppliers over a ten to fifteen day period  we tend to experience significant swings in supplier payables depending on the absolute level of our cost of revenue during the last few weeks of every quarter

new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for the acquisition of intangible assets outside of a business combination and for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
this accounting standard requires that goodwill be separately disclosed from other intangible assets in the statement of financial position  and no longer be amortized but tested for impairment at least annually 
sfas also requires us to complete a transitional goodwill impairment test six months from the date of adoption 
we adopted the provisions of sfas effective january   and  as a result  will not record goodwill amortization 
as the acquisition of our majority interest in priceline 
com europe ltd 
occurred after june   we had no goodwill amortization relating to the acquisition for the year ended december  we completed a goodwill impairment review as of january   using a fair value approach in accordance with sfas  and found no impairment 
during the third quarter  we performed a subsequent impairment test and recorded an impairment charge which is described in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  which supersedes both statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions opinion  for the disposal of a segment of a business as previously defined in that opinion 
sfas retains the fundamental provisions in sfas for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  while also resolving significant implementation issues associated with sfas sfas retains the basic provisions of opinion on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas  an impairment assessment under sfas will not result in a write down of goodwill 
rather  goodwill is evaluated for impairment under sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
we adopted the provisions of sfas effective january  in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this statement amends sfas no 
 stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the disclosure provisions of this statement are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and have been incorporated into our financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
in may  the financial standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
among other things  under the provision of fsas no 
 gains and losses from the early extinguishment of debt are no longer classified as an extraordinary item  net of income taxes  but are included in the determination of pretax earnings 
the effective date for sfas no 
is for fiscal years beginning after may   with early application encouraged 
upon adoption  all gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt previously reported as an extraordinary item shall be reclassified to pretax earnings 
it is anticipated that the adoption of sfas no 
will have no impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
this statement addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance that the emerging issues task force eitf has set forth in eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas and eitf is that sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred versus the eitf where a liability was recognized on the date an entity committed to an exit plan 
sfas is effective for exit and disposal activities that are initiated after december  we will adopt the new standard effective january  in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation expands the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee 
in general  fin applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying instrument that is related to an asset  liability  or equity security of the guaranteed party 
certain guarantee contracts are excluded from both the disclosure and recognition requirements of this interpretation 
other guarantees are subject to the disclosure requirements of fin but not to the recognition provisions and include  among others  a guarantee accounted for as a derivative instrument under sfas the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for us as of december   and require disclosure of the nature of the guarantee  the maximum potential amount of future payments that the guarantor could be required to make under the guarantee  and the current amount of the liability  if any  for the guarantor s obligations under the guarantee 
the recognition requirements of fin are to be applied prospectively to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect the requirements of fin to have a material impact on results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities which clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applies in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  we do not have any equity investments in variable interest entities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk priceline 
com currently has no floating rate indebtedness  holds no derivative instruments other than through investments in licensees described in this annual report on form k and does not earn significant foreign sourced income 
accordingly  changes in interest rates or currency exchange rates do not generally have a material direct effect on priceline 
com s financial position 
however  changes in currency exchange rates may affect the cost of international airline tickets and international hotel reservations offered through the priceline 
com service  and so may indirectly affect consumer demand for such products and priceline 
com s revenue 
additionally  fixed rate investments are subject to interest rate volatility 
in the event of such weakness  such additional us dollars would have reduced purchasing power 
in addition  to the extent that changes in interest rates and currency exchange rates affect general economic conditions  priceline 
com would also be affected by such changes 
if the us dollar weakens versus the british pound sterling  we may have to invest additional us dollars in priceline

to fund its ongoing operations
