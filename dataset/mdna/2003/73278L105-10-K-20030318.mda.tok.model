item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general we sell everything necessary to build  maintain  install and overhaul residential and small commercial swimming pools  including swimming pool equipment  parts and supplies  chemicals  cleaners  packaged pools  liners  filters  heaters  pumps  lights  repair parts  and other equipment 
since  we have significantly increased our offering of complementary products including building materials  electrical supplies  toys and games  water features such as fountains  and spas and spa accessories 
we primarily sell to swimming pool remodelers and builders  retail swimming pool stores  and swimming pool repair and service companies 
these customers are mostly small  family owned businesses with relatively limited capital resources 
we maintain a strict credit policy 
in the past  losses from customer receivables have been within our expectations 
our expenses consist primarily of i the cost of products purchased for resale and ii operating expenses which are primarily related to labor  occupancy  freight  marketing  and selling and administrative expenses 
we compete for business and may respond to competitive pressures by lowering prices in order to maintain our market share 
such measures adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general continued we calculate same store growth by excluding the following service centers from the calculation for months new service centers opened within the past months  service centers acquired within the past months  service centers consolidated with acquired service centers  and service centers that experience market disruption due to their location in the immediate market areas of those mentioned above 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began calculating our base business growth  which is consistent with measures used by other distributors 
we calculate base business growth by excluding the following service centers from the calculation for months service centers acquired within the past months  service centers consolidated with acquired service centers  and new service centers opened in new markets in the past months 
the base business calculation differs slightly from the same store calculation because base business includes i new service centers opened in existing markets and ii service centers affected due to their location in the immediate market areas of newly opened or acquired locations 
additionally  we allocate overhead expenses to the base business by considering base business net sales as a percentage of total net sales 
the swimming pool industry we believe that the swimming pool industry is relatively young  with room for tremendous growth 
of the approximately million households in the united states that have the economic capacity and the yard space to have a swimming pool  barely own a pool 
the industry has grown at a annual rate for the past years 
we believe the swimming pool industry will continue to grow annually over the next five years  primarily by the need to maintain the growing installed base of pools and secondarily by new pool installations 
the greater part of revenues in our industry is derived from the maintenance of existing swimming pools and the repair and replacement of the equipment that maintains those pools 
thus  the industry generally has not been negatively affected by economic downturns  although there is no assurance that this will continue 
the demand for new pools is driven by the perceived benefits of pool ownership including relaxation  entertainment  family activity  exercise  convenience and landscaping 
the industry competes for new pool sales against other discretionary consumer purchases such as kitchen and bathroom remodeling  boats  motorcycles  recreational vehicles and vacations 
the business in the swimming pool industry is seasonal  and weather is the biggest challenge 
the industry is also affected by other factors including consumer saving and discretionary spending levels  the rate of new housing construction and consumer attitudes toward pool products for environmental or safety reasons

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that are both important to the accurate portrayal of a company s financial condition and results  and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that the nature of our business is such that there are few  if any  complex challenges in accounting for operations 
in order to prepare financial statements that conform to accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap  we make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
certain estimates are particularly sensitive due to their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may be significantly different from our expectations 
we have identified the following five accounting policies that require us to make estimates in order to present fairly our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses if our customers do not make required payments 
we perform periodic credit evaluations of our customers and we typically do not require collateral 
consistent with industry practices  we require payment from our customers within days except for sales under early buy programs for which we provide extended payment terms to qualified customers 
the extended terms require payments in equal installments in april  may and june or may and june  depending on geographical location 
in the past  credit losses have been within our expectations 
as our business is seasonal  our customers businesses are also seasonal 
sales are lowest in the winter months  and our past due accounts receivable balance generally increases during this time 
we provide reserves for uncollectible accounts based on the accounts receivable aging ranging from for amounts currently due up to for specific accounts more than days past due 
at the end of each year  we perform a specific reserve analysis of all accounts with past due balances greater than  additionally  we perform a general reserve analysis on the balance of our accounts receivables with emphasis on the remainder of the past due portion of the aging 
as we review these past due accounts  we evaluate collectibility based on a combination of factors including aging statistics and trends  customer payment history  independent credit reports  and discussions with customers 
during the year  we write off account balances when we have exhausted reasonable collection efforts and determined that the likelihood of collection is remote 
such write offs are charged against our allowance for doubtful accounts 
in the past five years  write offs have averaged approximately of net sales 
if the balance of the accounts receivable reserve increased or decreased by at december   pretax income would change by approximately million or per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december  scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies continued inventory obsolescence and shrink reserve product inventories represent the largest asset on our balance sheet 
our goal is to manage our inventory such that we minimize stock outs and provide the highest level of service to our customers 
to do this  we maintain at each service center an adequate inventory of skus with the highest sales volume 
at the same time  we continuously strive to better manage our slower moving classes of inventory which are not as critical to our customers and thus inherently have lower velocity 
service centers classify products into classes based on sales at that location over the past months 
the table below presents a description of these inventory classes classes fastest moving items  which represent approximately of net sales at the service center classes slower moving items  which we keep in stock to provide a high level of customer service class products with no sales at a particular service center for the past twelve months or special order products not yet delivered to the customer products in classes turn quickly  thus there is little risk of obsolescence 
we establish our reserve for inventory obsolescence based on inventory classes  with particular emphasis on skus with the weakest sales over the previous months 
the reserve is intended to reflect the value of inventory that we may not be able to sell at a profit 
we believe our greatest exposure to inventory obsolescence is inventory classes we provide a general reserve of for such inventory 
we also provide an additional reserve for excess inventory in classes and an additional for excess class inventory 
we define excess inventory as the amount of inventory on hand in excess of the previous months usage on a company wide basis 
in evaluating the adequacy of the reserve for inventory obsolescence and shrink  we consider a combination of factors including the level of inventory in relationship to historical sales level by product  including inventory usage by class based on product sales at both the service center and company levels  changes in customer preferences  the experience of the service center manager  the previous inventory management performance of the service center  geographical location  and new product offerings 
the reserve for inventory obsolescence may periodically require adjustment as changes occur in the above identified factors 
if the balance of the inventory reserve increased or decreased by at december   pretax income would change by approximately million or per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december  scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies continued revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin sab  revenue recognition in financial statements  and the appropriate amendments 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before we can recognize revenue persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the amounts recognized are fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we record revenue when customers take delivery of products 
customers may pick up products at any service center location  or products may be delivered via our trucks or third party carriers 
products shipped via third party carriers are considered delivered based on the shipping terms  which are generally fob shipping point 
we may offer volume rebates  which we accrue monthly as an adjustment to net sales 
additionally  in certain markets  we may offer discount terms of for invoices paid within days 
we record customer returns  including those associated with early buy programs  as an adjustment to net sales 
in the past  customer returns have not been material 
vendor rebates we account for vendor rebates in accordance with the emerging issues task force issue  accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor 
many of our arrangements with our vendors provide for us to receive a rebate of a specified amount of consideration  payable to us when we achieve any of a number of measures  generally related to a specified cumulative level of purchases from our vendors 
we account for such rebates as a reduction of the prices of the vendor s products and therefore as a reduction of inventory until we sell the product  at which time such rebates reduce cost of sales in our income statement 
throughout the year  we estimate the amount of the rebate earned based on our estimate of purchases to date relative to the purchase levels that mark our progress toward earning the rebates 
we continually revise these estimates to reflect actual rebates earned based on actual purchase levels 
if market conditions were to change  vendors may change the terms of some or all of these programs 
such changes could lower or raise our gross margins on products we sell or revenues earned

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations goodwill goodwill represents the excess of acquisition costs over the estimated fair value of net assets acquired 
at december   our net goodwill balance was million  representing of total assets and of stockholders equity 
in january  we adopted sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
under these new rules  we no longer amortize goodwill 
instead  we test goodwill for impairment annually or at any other time when impairment indicators exist 
we completed the transitional goodwill impairment test as required under sfas and determined that goodwill was not impaired 
this transitional test required comparison of our company s estimated fair value at january  to the book value  including goodwill 
additionally  we performed the first annual impairment test in october noting that goodwill is not impaired 
if circumstances change or events occur to indicate that our company s fair market value has fallen below the book value  we will compare the estimated fair value of the goodwill to its book value 
if the book value of goodwill exceeds the estimated fair value of goodwill  we will recognize the difference as an impairment loss in operating income

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations the following discussion of consolidated operating results includes the operating results from acquisitions in  and we accounted for these acquisitions using the purchase method of accounting  and we have included the results of operations in our consolidated results since the respective acquisition dates

same store sales growth was in scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared to continued the base business sales growth trend was adversely affected in primarily by unfavorable weather throughout most of the year 
the pool season experienced a slow start with extended cold weather in the north and unusually wet conditions in the south 
mild temperatures in the north during the summer months further aggravated the season s slow start  while a stagnant tropical system shut down the pool business in the south central united states for two weeks in june  which is typically the most active sales month 
additionally  the tragic events of september th put a damper on late season sales in the swimming pool industry 
gross profit increased million  or  to million in compared to million in base business gross profit growth of nearly contributed million to the increase  while acquired locations and new service centers in new markets accounted for the remaining increase 
same store gross profit growth was nearly in base business gross profit growth was due to several factors including a increase in base business sales  improvements in pricing accuracy and greater pricing discipline at the point of sale  a continued focus on a preferred vendor program initiated in which encourages service centers to purchase products from a smaller number of vendors in order to effect more efficient purchasing and inventory management  increased sales of complementary products that typically enjoy higher gross margins  and the utilization of centralized shipping locations which purchase slower turning inventories such as parts in bulk quantities and then redistribute products to service centers 
these improvements led to an increase in gross margin to in from in  despite the dilutive impact of newly opened and acquired service centers 
base business gross margin increased to in from in operating expenses consisting of selling and administrative expenses and goodwill amortization increased million  or  to million in from million in acquired service centers and new locations in new markets accounted for million of the increase 
base business operating expenses increased million primarily due to the following increases in salary expense to support the increase in sales and a continued focus on improving customer service  an increase in occupancy costs due to the relocation of existing service centers to larger sites to accommodate their growth in activity and the introduction of new products  and an increase in freight costs resulting from higher gas prices in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales increased to in from in base business operating expense as a percentage of net sales increased basis points to in from in  primarily due to our increased investment in sales  marketing and service programs and lower than expected sales in caused by the unfavorable weather conditions discussed above 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations compared to continued interest expense increased million to million in from million in primarily because average debt outstanding increased to million in compared to million in additionally  we wrote off approximately million of financing costs in the fourth quarter of when we replaced our senior loan facility one year prior to the maturity date 
income taxes increased million to million for compared to million for  primarily due to the million increase in income before income taxes 
during the fourth quarter of  our effective income tax rate increased to from as a result of changes in our state income tax mix 
seasonality and quarterly fluctuations our business is highly seasonal  and weather is the principal external factor affecting our business 
the table below presents some of the possible effects resulting from various weather conditions weather possible effects hot and dry increased purchases of chemicals and supplies for existing swimming pools increased purchases of above ground pools unseasonably cool weather or extraordinary fewer pool installations amounts of rain decreased purchases of chemicals and supplies decreased purchases of impulse items such as above ground pools and accessories unseasonably early warming trends a longer pool season  thus increasing our sales primarily in the northern half of the us unseasonably late warming trends a shorter pool season  thus decreasing our sales primarily in the northern half of the us in general  sales and operating income are highest during the second and third quarters  which represent the peak months of swimming pool use and installation 
sales are substantially lower during the first and fourth quarters when we may incur net losses 
in  approximately of net sales were generated in the second and third quarters of the year  and approximately of operating income was generated in that same period 
we typically experience a build up of product inventories and accounts payable during the winter months in anticipation of the upcoming peak selling season 
excluding borrowings to finance acquisitions and share repurchases  our peak borrowing usually occurs in late first quarter or early second quarter  primarily because extended payment terms offered by our suppliers typically are payable in april  may and june  while our peak accounts receivable collections typically occur in june  july and august 
we expect that our quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate depending on the timing and amount of revenue contributed by new and acquired service centers 
we attempt to open new service centers at the end of the fourth quarter or the first quarter of the subsequent year to take advantage of preseason sales programs and the upcoming peak selling season 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations seasonality and quarterly fluctuations continued the table below presents certain unaudited quarterly data for and in our opinion  this information reflects all normal and recurring adjustments considered necessary for a fair presentation of this data 
the results of any one or more quarters are not necessarily a good indication of results for an entire fiscal year or of continuing trends 
unaudited quarter in thousands first second third fourth first second third fourth net sales      gross profit      operating income loss     net sales as a of annual net sales gross profit as a of annual gross profit operating income loss as a of annual operating income liquidity and capital resources liquidity is defined as the ability to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet the current need for cash 
we assess our liquidity in terms of our ability to generate cash to fund our operating activities  taking into consideration the seasonal nature of our business 
significant factors which could affect liquidity include the following the adequacy of available bank lines of credit  the ability to attract long term capital with satisfactory terms  cash flows generated from operating activities  acquisitions  the timing and extent of share repurchases  and capital expenditures 
our primary sources of working capital are cash from operations supplemented by bank borrowings under a credit agreement the credit agreement with a group of banks 
our primary capital needs are seasonal working capital obligations and other general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and share repurchases 
in the past  borrowings  together with cash from operations and seller financing  have been sufficient to support our growth and to finance acquisitions 
the credit agreement  which matures on november   allows us to borrow under a revolving line of credit the revolving credit facility 
in august  we expanded our borrowing capacity under the revolving credit facility from million to million to facilitate the fort wayne acquisition and share repurchases 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources continued during the twelve months ended december   we received net proceeds of million under the revolving credit facility 
at december   there was million outstanding and million available for borrowing under the revolving credit facility  subject to borrowing base availability supported by trade accounts receivable and product inventories 
in order to meet seasonal working capital needs  in the first quarter of we also borrowed additional funds in the form of two short term notes 
on march  there was million outstanding and million available for borrowing under these notes 
the average effective interest rate of the revolving credit facility was for the twelve month period ended december  interest on borrowings under the revolving credit facility may be paid at either of the following rates  in each case depending on our leverage ratio a 
the agent s corporate base rate or the federal funds rate plus  whichever is higher  plus a margin ranging from to  or b 
the current eurodollar rate plus a margin ranging from to 
substantially all of our assets  including the capital stock of our wholly owned subsidiaries  secure our obligations under the revolving credit facility 
the revolving credit facility has numerous restrictive covenants  which require that we maintain a minimum net worth and fixed charge coverage and which also restrict our ability to pay dividends 
as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants and financial ratio requirements 
at december   our contractual obligations of long term debt and operating leases were as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual less than years and obligations total year years years thereafter long term debt    operating leases      net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million in from million in  primarily due to the decrease in product inventories  partially offset by the decrease in accounts payable 
in  net cash provided by operating activities increased million to million from million in  primarily due to a million increase in net income 
in the fourth quarter of  we made payments to vendors of approximately million for product inventory receipts with extended terms 
we made these payments to take advantage of prompt payment discounts offered by manufacturers in the fourth quarter of such off season early buy purchases are normal in the pool industry except for manufacturers choosing to ship on a more accelerated basis in the fourth quarter of versus prior year fourth quarters 
these purchases consisted mainly of high velocity whole goods such as pumps  filters  heaters and cleaners with little risk of obsolescence 
initially  acquisitions are financed through increased borrowings under our revolving credit facility and those borrowings are then reduced with cash flows from operations 
the same principle applies for funds used for share repurchases and capital expenditures 
scp pool corporation part ii 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources continued we believe we have adequate availability of capital to fund present operations and anticipated growth  including expansion in existing and targeted market areas 
we continually evaluate potential acquisitions and we have held discussions with a number of acquisition candidates 
however  we currently have no binding agreement with respect to any acquisition candidate 
if suitable acquisition opportunities or working capital needs arise that would require additional financing  we believe that our financial position and earnings history provide a solid base for obtaining additional financing resources at competitive rates and terms 
additionally  we may issue common or preferred stock to raise funds 
accounts receivable and the allowance for doubtful accounts excluding the approximate million fort wayne accounts receivable  accounts receivable increased million  or  to million at december  compared to million at december  this increase is less than the increase in base business net sales between periods 
the allowance for doubtful accounts increased to million at december  from million at december  this increase is consistent with the increase in gross and past due accounts receivable from to we continue to maintain an adequate reserve of the greater than days past due receivables 
the allowance remained relatively consistent as a percentage of the greater than days past due receivables at at december  compared to at december  product inventories and the reserve for shrink and obsolescence excluding the approximate million fort wayne inventory  product inventories decreased million  or  to million at december  from million at december  as discussed in our annual report on form k  the inventory balance at the end of was approximately million higher than typically required at the end of the year because we received significant early buy purchases in the fourth quarter of from manufacturers motivated to reduce their own inventory levels 
adjusted for the additional million of inventory received in late and excluding the fort wayne inventory in  our base business inventory increased by approximately million  or  which is consistent with the increase in base business sales 
average inventory per service center at the end of was approximately  less than average inventory per service center at december  as we continue to improve the quality of our inventory  the inventory reserve has decreased accordingly to million at december  from million at december  the reserve as a percentage of slow moving class inventory decreased to at the end of compared to at the end of at december   approximately of our inventory balance was comprised of high velocity inventory classes through scp pool corporation part ii

in december  we retired all treasury shares 
between february  and march   we purchased  shares of our common stock in the open market at an average price of per share 
as part of our share repurchase program  in july our board of directors authorized an additional million for share repurchases  of which million remained available as of march  we intend to continue to repurchase shares on the open market from time to time  depending on market conditions 
the impact of our common stock repurchases had the effect of reducing diluted weighted average shares outstanding by approximately million shares for the year ended december  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks  including interest rate risk and foreign currency risk 
the adverse effects of potential changes in these market risks are discussed below 
the following discussion does not consider the effects of the reduced level of overall economic activity that could exist following such changes 
further  in the event of changes of such magnitude  we would likely take actions to mitigate our exposure to such changes 
interest rate risk our earnings are exposed to changes in short term interest rates because of the variable interest rates on our long term debt 
if i the variable rates on our revolving credit facility increased or decreased from the rate at december   and ii we borrowed the maximum amount available under the revolving credit facility million for all of  then our pretax income would change by approximately million or per diluted share based on the number of diluted shares outstanding at december  the fair value of our revolving credit facility is not affected by changes in market interest rates

in the past  we have not hedged our foreign currency exposure  and fluctuations in exchange rates have not materially affected our operating results

among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are the following the sensitivity of the industry to weather conditions the intense competition and low barriers to entry in the industry the sensitivity of the industry to general economic and market conditions our ability to penetrate new markets identify appropriate acquisition candidates  complete acquisitions on satisfactory terms and successfully integrate acquired businesses obtain financing on satisfactory terms generate sufficient cash flows to support expansion plans and for general operating activities maintain favorable supplier arrangements and relationships remain in compliance with the numerous environmental  health and safety requirements to which we are subject the effectiveness of our advertising  marketing and promotional programs changes in laws and regulations  including changes in accounting standards and taxation requirements including tax rate changes  new tax laws and revised tax law interpretations the risk of fire  safety and casualty losses and related liability claims inherent in the storage of chemicals that we sell we cannot guarantee that any future event or result will be realized  although we believe we have been prudent in our plans and assumptions 
should additional risks or uncertainties materialize  or should underlying assumptions prove inaccurate  actual results could differ materially from those anticipated 
investors should bear this in mind as they consider forward looking statements
