critical accounting policies in preparing consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following areas require management to make estimates that are susceptible to significant change in the near term 
consumer products allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company provides an allowance for doubtful accounts based on management s estimate of uncollectible amounts 
the estimate is based on historical collection experience and a review of the current status of trade accounts receivable 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
allowance for obsolete inventory 
the company provides an allowance for obsolete inventory items based on management s estimate 
the estimate is based on items which are slow moving or obsolete and for which management estimates that full value cannot be realized 
amortization of goodwill 
the financial accounting standards board issued statement  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  ie  january  for calendar year companies 
this statement provides that goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized against income but are reviewed at least annually for impairment 
an impairment review is designed to determine whether the fair value  and the related recorded goodwill  of a reporting unit is below its carrying value 
in the year of adoption  any impairment loss will be recorded as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
thereafter  goodwill impairment losses will be charged to operations 
deferred tax assets 
amounts provided for income tax expense are based on income reported for financial statement purposes and do not necessarily represent amounts currently payable under tax laws 
deferred income tax assets and liabilities are computed annually for differences between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in taxable or deductible amounts in the future based on enacted tax laws and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
as changes in tax laws or rates are enacted  deferred tax assets and liabilities are adjusted through the provision for income taxes 
the differences relate principally to different methods used for depreciation for income tax purposes  vacation accruals  health insurance  deferred revenue  net operating losses  capitalization requirements of the internal revenue code  allowances for doubtful accounts and obsolete inventory and charitable contribution carryforwards 
valuation allowances are established when necessary to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
financial services accrual of interest income 
interest income is accrued on the unpaid principal balance of loans 
the accrual of interest income on impaired loans is discontinued when  in the opinion of management  there is reasonable doubt as to the borrower s ability to meet payments of interest or principal when they become due 
loans are returned to accrual status when the principal and interest amounts contractually due are brought current and future payments are reasonably assured 
accrual of rental income 
rent is accrued on a monthly basis based on lease agreements 
if it is determined by management that the lessee will not be able to make rent payments as required by the lease agreement  the accrual of rent is discontinued until management determines the rent to be collectible 
allowance for loan losses 
loans that management has the intent and ability to hold for the foreseeable future or until maturity or payoff are reported at the amount of unpaid principal  reduced by the allowance for loan losses 
management reviews the value of the collateral securing each loan to determine if an allowance for loan losses is necessary 
leased properties 
leased properties are recorded at cost and are depreciated using the straight line method 
the costs of normal repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
nonperforming loans 
a loan is impaired when  based on current information and events  management does not expect to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement in the normal course of business 
a loan is also impaired when the loan contract is restructured by extending the due date of either principal or interest payments or by reducing the interest rate on the loan 
a loan is not impaired during a period of delay in payment if management expects to collect all amounts due including accrued interest at the contractual interest rate for the period of the delay 
when the projected cash flow of the business from all sources including capital contributions  conversion of assets to cash  and net income plus depreciation are inadequate to make contractual payments as scheduled  then the loan is considered impaired 
unfunded commitments 
unfunded commitments are recorded in the financial statements when they are funded or when related fees are incurred or received 
derivative instruments

the net gain loss on instruments classified as cash flow hedges are reported as changes in other comprehensive income 
the net gain loss on instruments classified as fair value hedges are reported as increases decreases in current year earnings 
all derivatives are marked to market on the balance sheet 
fair value of financial instruments 
financial accounting standards board statement no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments  requires disclosure of fair value information about financial instruments  whether or not recognized in the balance sheet  for which it is practicable to estimate that value 
in cases where quoted market prices are not available  fair values are based on estimates using present value or other valuation techniques 
those techniques are significantly affected by the assumptions used  including the discount rate and estimates of future cash flows 
in that regard  the derived fair value estimates cannot be substantiated by comparison to independent markets and  in many cases  could not be realized in immediate settlement of the instrument 
statement no 
excludes certain financial instruments from its disclosure requirements 
accordingly  the aggregate fair value amounts presented do not represent the underlying value of the company see note

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company utilizes derivative instruments for purposes of asset liability management which involves both credit and market risk 
the company has entered into various interest rate swap agreements with other financial institutions to manage interest rate exposure 
the company may be susceptible to risk with respect to interest rate swap agreements to the extent of nonperformance by the financial institutions participating in the interest rate swap agreements 
however  the company does not anticipate nonperformance by these institutions 
interest rate swaps are contracts in which a series of interest rate payments are exchanged over a specified period based on a notional amount 
the notional amount on which the interest payments are based is not exchanged 
therefore  notional amounts do not represent direct credit exposures as the exposure is limited to the net difference between the calculated amounts to be received and paid by the financial institutions participating in the interest rate swap 
most interest rate swaps involve the exchange of fixed and floating interest rates 
by entering into an interest rate swap the company can change the interest payment stream and effectively change fixed rate debt into variable rate debt 
the company s interest rate swap agreements are structured so that the company pays a variable interest rate and receives a fixed rate based on the libor index 
in august of  the company entered into additional interest rate swap agreements which then fixed the interest rate spread of the existing rate swaps 
these swap agreements allow the company to pay a fixed rate and receive a variable rate based on the libor index 
the following table summarizes the interest rate swap agreements in effect at december  variable interest fixed interest notional company fair market rate rate expiration rate amount payment value paid received received paid date index  variable  libor  fixed  libor  variable  libor  fixed  libor  variable  libor  fixed  libor as a result of hedge arrangements  the company recognized a million reduction in interest expense for the year ended december  and a million reduction in interest expense for the year ended december  in  addition  the company recognized a gain of million in and a gain of million in on the termination of interest rate swaps
