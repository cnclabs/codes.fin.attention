a significant portion of the company s revenue for fiscal will be generated from its existing backlog of sales orders 
the backlog of orders at august  was approximately  all orders included in backlog are covered by signed contracts or purchase orders 
nevertheless  contracts involving government programs may be terminated at the discretion of the government 
in the event of the cancellation of a significant amount of government contracts included in the company s backlog  the company will be required to rely more heavily on cash reserves and its existing credit facility to fund its operations 
the company is not aware of any events which are reasonably likely to result in any cancellation of its government contracts

as part of its oversight responsibilities  management continually evaluates the propriety of its accounting methods as new events occur 
management believes that its policies are applied in a manner which is intended to provide the user of the company s financial statements a current  accurate and complete presentation of information in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states of america 
important accounting practices that require the use of assumptions and judgments are outlined below 
revenue under certain long term  fixed price contracts is recognized using the percentage of completion method of accounting 
revenue recognized on these contracts is based on estimated completion to date the total contract amount multiplied by percent of performance  based on total costs incurred in relation to total estimated cost at completion 
contract costs include all direct material and labor costs and those indirect costs related to contract performance 
risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimation process could affect the amounts reported in our financial statements 
the key assumptions used in the estimate of costs to complete relate to labor costs and indirect costs required to complete the contract 
the estimate of rates and hours as well as the application of overhead costs is reviewed on a regular basis 
if our business conditions were different  or if we used different assumptions in the application of this and other accounting policies  it is likely that materially different amounts would be reported on our financial statements 
prospective losses on contracts are based upon the anticipated excess of manufacturing costs over the selling price of the units to be delivered under the contract and are recorded when first reasonably determinable 
actual losses could differ from those estimated due to changes in the ultimate manufacturing costs 
inventories are stated at lower of cost principally first in  first out or market 
a valuation allowance for obsolete and slow moving inventory is established based upon an aging of raw material components 
current requirements for raw materials are evaluated based on current backlog of orders for products in which the components are used and anticipated future orders 
under the non amortization approach in accounting for goodwill under sfas no 
 goodwill is not amortized into results of operations but instead is reviewed for impairment and written down and charged to results of operations in the period in which the recorded value of goodwill is more than its fair value 
an annual impairment test is performed in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year and any impairment of goodwill is charged to operations 
provisions for federal  foreign  state and local income taxes are calculated on reported financial statement pretax income based on current tax law and also include the cumulative effect of any changes in tax rates from those used previously in determining deferred tax assets and liabilities 
such provisions differ from the amounts currently payable because certain items of income and expense are recognized in different time periods for financial reporting purposes than for income tax purposes
