the company we are a provider of electronic government services that help governments use the internet to reduce costs and provide a higher level of service to businesses and citizens 
we accomplish this currently through two primary divisions our portal outsourcing businesses and our software and services businesses 
in our core business  portal outsourcing  we enter into contracts with governments and on their behalf design  build and operate web based portals 
we typically enter into three to five year contracts with our government clients and manage operations for each contractual relationship through separate subsidiaries that operate as decentralized business units with a high degree of autonomy 
our portals consist of web sites and applications that we build  which allow businesses and citizens to access government information online and complete transactions  including applying for a permit  retrieving driver s license records or filing a form or report 
we typically market the services and solicit users to complete government based transactions and to enter into subscriber contracts permitting the user to access the portal and the government information contained therein in exchange for transactional and or subscription user fees 
we are typically responsible for funding up front investment and ongoing operational costs of the government portals 
our unique self funding business model allows us to reduce our government clients financial and technology risks and obtain revenues by sharing in the fees we generate from electronic government services 
our clients benefit because they gain a centralized  customer focused presence on the internet 
businesses and citizens gain a faster  more convenient and more cost effective means to interact with governments 
on behalf of our government clients  we enter into separate agreements with various agencies and divisions of the government to provide specific services and to conduct specific transactions 
these agreements preliminarily establish the pricing of the electronic transactions and data access services we provide and the division of revenues between the company and the government agency 
the government must approve prices and revenue sharing agreements 
we generally own all the applications developed under these contracts 
after completion of a defined contract term  the government agency typically receives a perpetual  royalty free license to the applications for use only 
if our contract were not renewed after a defined term  the government agency would be entitled to take over the portal in place with no future obligation of the company 
in some cases  we enter into contracts to provide consulting  development and management services to government portals in exchange for an agreed upon fee 
currently  we have contracts to provide portal outsourcing services for eighteen states and nine local governments 
we intend to increase our revenues and profitability by marketing our portal outsourcing services to new states and municipalities  increasing adoption of existing portal applications and services  delivering new applications and services and expanding markets within our existing contractual relationships 
historically  our software and services businesses have included our eprocurement  corporate filings  ethics elections  transportation and aol businesses 
in september  we acquired the net assets of efed  a provider of internet based procurement software and services for governments 
efed was renamed nic commerce and is wholly owned by nic 
in the second quarter of  we exited our domestic eprocurement business entirely and have classified the results of operations of nic commerce as discontinued operations 
in january  we merged our application services division with conquest softworks  llc and renamed the company nic conquest 
nic conquest  a wholly owned subsidiary of nic and our corporate filings business  is a provider of ucc and corporation software applications and services that facilitate electronic filings and document management for secretaries of state 
in may  we acquired sdr technologies  inc  a provider of internet based applications for governments 
sdr has been renamed nic technologies and is wholly owned by nic 
nic technologies  our ethics elections business  designs and develops online campaign expenditure and ethics compliance systems for federal and state government agencies 
in october  we acquired intelligent decision technologies  ltd  or idt  a provider of business to government reporting and filing software for the transportation industry 
in the second quarter of  we decided to wind down substantially all of idt s operations 
as of december   idt did not qualify as a discontinued operation 
all business acquisitions in and were accounted for as purchases and the results of the acquired companies operations have been included in our consolidated statements of operations from the respective dates of acquisition 
for additional information relating to our acquired businesses  refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
in august  we entered into a three year agreement with america online  inc to deliver government information  services and applications through aol s government guide 
for additional information on our agreement with aol  refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we expanded rapidly following our initial public offering in july and have incurred substantial net losses primarily as a result of our acquired software and services businesses 
throughout this time period  our core outsourced portal operations have also grown and have been profitable 
as part of a broader strategic refocusing on our profitable core outsourced portal business during  we exited our eprocurement and transportation businesses and restructured the other software and services businesses in an effort to accelerate our path to profitability 
we became profitable in the second half of but did not generate positive cash flow from operations in we expect the company to be profitable in and have focused the business on operations we believe have demonstrable ability to produce positive net income and cash flow in the future 
however  any projections of future results of operations and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if current cash  marketable securities and cash that may be generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity securities  issue debt securities or increase our working capital line of credit 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
overview of business models and revenue recognition we classify our revenues and cost of revenues into two categories portal and software and services 
the portal category includes revenues and cost of revenues primarily from our subsidiaries operating state and local government portals on an outsourced basis 
the software and services category includes revenues and cost of revenues primarily from our corporate filings  ethics elections  transportation and aol businesses 
we currently derive revenue from four main sources o transaction based fees  o fees for managing portal operations  o fees for application development  and o advertising fees from aol 
each of these revenue types and the corresponding business models are further described below 
our portal outsourcing businesses we categorize our portal revenues according to the underlying source of revenue 
a brief description of each category follows o dmv transaction based these are transaction fees from the sale of driver history records  referred to as dmv records  from our state portals to data resellers  insurance companies and other pre authorized customers  and are generally recurring 
o non dmv transaction based these are transaction fees other than from the sale of dmv records for transactions conducted by businesses and citizens through our state and local portals  and are generally recurring 
for a representative listing of non dmv products and services we currently offer through our state and local portals  refer to part i  item in this form k 
o portal management these are recurring fees paid to us by our government clients for the operation of state and local portals  which typically supplement transaction based fees 
o software development these are fees from the performance of software development projects and other time and materials services for our government clients 
while we actively market these services  they may not have the same degree of predictability as our transaction based or portal management revenues 
the highest volume  most commercially valuable service we offer is access to dmv records through our insurance industry records exchange network 
this service accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues in  in and in we believe that while this application will continue to be an important source of revenue  its contribution as a percentage of our total revenues will decline modestly as other sources grow 
choicepoint  which resells these records to the auto insurance industry  accounted for approximately of revenues in  in and in in  portal revenues accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
in our outsourced portal businesses for  dmv transaction based revenues represented approximately of portal revenues  non dmv transaction based revenues represented approximately  software development represented  and portal management represented approximately 
transaction based revenues from our outsourced state portal business units are highly correlated to population  but are also affected by pricing policies established by government entities for public records  the number and growth of commercial enterprises and the government entity s development of policy and information technology infrastructure supporting electronic government 
we charge for access to records on a per record basis and  depending upon government policies  also on a fixed or sliding scale bulk basis 
our fees are set by negotiation with the government agencies that control the records and are typically approved by a government sanctioned oversight body 
we recognize revenues from transactions primarily information access fees and filing fees on an accrual basis net of the transaction fee due to the government  and we bill end user customers primarily on a monthly basis 
we typically receive a majority of payments via electronic funds transfer and credit card within days of billing and remit payment to governments within days of the transaction 
the costs that we pay state agencies for data access are accrued as accounts receivable and accounts payable at the time revenue from the access of public information is recognized 
we must remit a certain amount or percentage of these fees to government agencies regardless of whether we ultimately collect the fees 
the pricing of transactions varies by the type of transaction and by state 
currently  under our contracts with the states of iowa  new hampshire and vermont  kent and washtenaw counties  and corpus christi  texas  we provide consulting  development and management services for these government portals predominantly under fixed price and time and materials models 
however  under our contract with the state of iowa  we anticipate transaction based revenues beginning in we expense as incurred all employee costs to start up  operate and maintain outsourced government portals as costs of performance under the contracts because  after the completion of a defined contract term  the government entities with which we contract typically receive a perpetual  royalty free license to the applications we developed 
such costs are included in cost of portal revenues in the consolidated statements of operations 
our software and services businesses corporate filings our corporate filings business derives the majority of its revenues from fixed price application development contracts and recognizes revenues on the percentage of completion method 
the average size contract for this business has historically been approximately million to million 
however  as further discussed below  our five year contract with the california secretary of state is valued at approximately million 
in  our corporate filings business accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
in september  our corporate filings business was awarded a five year contract by the california secretary of state to build an information management and retrieval system for the business programs division of the california secretary of state 
this contract is valued at approximately million and is the largest government contract we have ever been awarded 
this award is both the nation s largest state egovernment filing initiative on record and the most comprehensive secretary of state outsourced filing system project in the united states 
the new web enabled document management and filing system will increase efficiency and reduce expenses for the state by eliminating paperwork and decreasing processing and turnaround times 
upon completion  the new system will allow agency customers  primarily from the banking and legal communities  to search  retrieve  and submit documents online 
customers will also be able to pay fees for a variety of transactions  including new incorporation document filings  trademark registrations  and uniform commercial code filings 
the contract includes comprehensive back office document and revenue management systems  web and internet applications that will take approximately of the agency s business programs division s services online  and imaging and indexing of more than ten million historical document pages 
we will also provide three years of onsite support and maintenance for the system 
work on this contract commenced in september  and we currently believe this contract will be profitable 
in march  we issued a million performance bond to the california secretary of state as required by contract 
the performance bond is collateralized by a million letter of credit 
prior to receiving our next major milestone payment under the contract  we are required to increase the amount of the performance bond to million 
if we are unsuccessful in obtaining a million performance bond  all remaining milestone payments to nic will be deferred until the date the secretary of state officially accepts the system and the maintenance period commences 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain a million performance bond or that a performance bond will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
at december   our corporate filings business was primarily engaged in servicing its contract with the california secretary of state and completing legacy contracts in oklahoma and arkansas 
by the end of the second quarter of  we expect to complete the majority of the remaining work on our contracts in arkansas and oklahoma  under which we have incurred substantial losses in the past 
this business is not actively marketing its products and services to new government entities 
ethics elections our ethics elections business derives the majority of its revenues from time and materials application development and maintenance outsourcing contracts and recognizes revenues as services are provided 
in  our ethics elections business accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
transportation our transportation business derives the majority of its revenues from cost plus time and materials application development contracts with governments and recognizes revenues as services are provided 
in  our transportation business accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
we decided to close our transportation business in and do not expect to generate substantial revenues from this business in aol in august  we entered into a three year agreement with america online  inc to deliver government information  services and applications through aol s government guide 
nic and aol share revenues generated from the license or sale of advertisement on or through the government guide 
we recognize our share of aol s advertising revenues when notified of the amount due from aol  which is approximately one month after the advertisement is provided 
our contract with aol ends in december  and we anticipate a significant decrease in revenues from our aol business throughout as compared to prior periods due to continued weakness in the online advertising market 
in  our aol business accounted for approximately of our consolidated revenues 
critical accounting policies a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
we have identified the policies below as critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
note that the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
management has discussed the development and selection of the critical accounting policies described below with the audit committee of the board of directors  and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
application development contracts our corporate filings business  nic conquest  derives the majority of its revenues from fixed price application development contracts and recognizes revenues on the percentage of completion method  primarily utilizing costs incurred to date as compared to the estimated total costs for each contract 
revenues and profits from these contracts are based on management s estimates to complete and are reviewed periodically  with adjustments recorded in the period in which the revisions are made 
use of the percentage of completion method requires that management be able to reasonably estimate total contract costs and costs to complete at each reporting date 
any anticipated losses on contracts are charged to operations as soon as they are determinable 
our corporate filings business has incurred substantial losses under its fixed price contracts in the past primarily due to cost overruns as further discussed in note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
it is possible that our costs will similarly exceed revenues in the future  as a result of unforeseen difficulties in the creation of an application called for in a contract  unforeseen challenges in ensuring compatibility with existing systems  rising development and personnel costs or other reasons 
if this occurs  particularly on our contract with the california secretary of state  which we currently expect to be profitable  our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows could be seriously harmed 
at december   the accrual for losses on all application development contracts was approximately million  which management believes is adequate 
because of the inherent uncertainties in estimating the costs of completion  it is at least reasonably possible that the estimate will change in the near term 
deferred income taxes we recognize deferred income taxes for the tax consequences in future years of differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their financial reporting amounts at each year end based on enacted laws and statutory tax rates applicable to the periods in which the differences are expected to affect taxable income 
valuation allowances are established  when necessary  to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount expected to be realized 
we have a recent history of unprofitable operations primarily due to operating losses incurred in the companies we have acquired since september these losses have generated significant federal tax net operating losses  or nols 
we had available at december    and nol carryforwards for federal tax purposes of approximately million  million  million and million that will expire in the years   and  respectively 
as discussed above  we became profitable in the second half of we expect the company to be profitable and generate taxable income in and have restructured and refocused the business on operations we believe have demonstrable ability to produce positive taxable income and cash flow in the future 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will generate sufficient taxable income from future operations to fully utilize the nol carryforwards prior to expiration 
the recorded amount of the deferred tax assets considered realizable could be reduced in the near term if estimates of future taxable income during the carryforward periods are reduced 
there is considerable management judgment necessary to determine future taxable income  and accordingly  actual results could vary significantly from such estimates 
for additional discussion of deferred income taxes  see the deferred tax assets section below and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
goodwill  intangible assets and long lived assets as further discussed below  during and we recorded impairment losses totaling million and million  respectively  relating mostly to goodwill and intangible assets arising from business combinations and capitalized software development costs 
at december   our recorded intangible assets were primarily comprised of internal use software development costs totaling approximately million and had no recorded goodwill remaining 
refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further discussion of the goodwill and intangible asset impairment losses we recorded in and at each balance sheet date  and whenever events or changes in circumstances warrant  management assesses the carrying value of long lived assets for possible impairment based primarily on the ability to recover the balances from expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows on an undiscounted basis were to be less than the carrying amount of the intangible asset  an impairment loss would be recognized for the amount by which the carrying value of the intangible asset exceeds its estimated fair value 
we estimate future discounted and undiscounted cash flows and fair values based upon historical performance  trends  and various other factors 
a significant change in the assumptions underlying the cash flows or fair values could result in a different determination of impairment loss and or the amount of any impairment 
impairment losses and restructuring charges in the third and fourth quarters of  we recorded impairment losses totaling million and million  respectively  relating to our nic commerce  nic technologies and nic conquest businesses 
in the second quarter of  we recorded impairment losses totaling million relating to our aol and idt businesses 
in the third quarter of and the fourth quarter of  we recorded restructuring charges totaling million and million  respectively  relating primarily to our nic commerce and nic technologies businesses 
nic commerce during the third quarter of  we identified indicators of possible impairment of our goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to the efed acquisition 
the impairment indicators included  but were not limited to  the recent restructurings in this business  which included workforce layoffs and office closings  significant underperformance of this business relative to historical and projected future operating results  management s reallocation of capital resources from this underperforming business to its most profitable businesses  and significant negative industry and economic trends within the eprocurement sector 
in addition to the management and organizational changes that had taken place at nic commerce since third quarter of  we continued the restructuring of this business by eliminating the majority of its marketing and business development staff due to poor performance  with additional headcount reductions made in october we concluded the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets related to the efed acquisition no longer had value and recognized a million impairment loss in the third quarter of furthermore  in december  we determined it was unlikely that nic commerce s colorado utah project would continue beyond the pilot phase of production 
this  among other factors  led us to determine that the nic commerce business would be downsized further in including certain senior administrative staff and development staff to more appropriately size operations to visible demand 
such demand could not support the recoverability of costs nic commerce had capitalized on the latest versions of its eprocurement software and million was expensed as an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of in the second quarter of  we exited our domestic eprocurement business entirely and have classified the results of operations of nic commerce as discontinued operations 
nic technologies during the third quarter of  we identified indicators of possible impairment of goodwill and other acquired intangible assets related to the sdr acquisition 
the impairment indicators included  but were not limited to  the recent restructuring in this business  which included workforce layoffs and office closings  and the significant underperformance of this business 
nic technologies had been integrated as the application development organization for our portal businesses 
however  a series of organizational restructurings completed in the third quarter of lead to significant layoffs at nic technologies and a shift in application development from what were previously centralized development operations in westlake village  california and pune  india to regionalized operations in selected state portals 
in total  less than employees who were employees of the original sdr technologies were employed with nic at december   down from a previous high of approximately employees at the date of acquisition in may additionally  we determined that the value of the technology intangible relating to the sdr acquisition was impaired 
we significantly curtailed funding of all research and development stage technology projects that did not have demonstrable and immediate positive financial returns for the company 
specifically  future funding to actively develop and market the company s web ivr technology was significantly scaled back 
this web ivr technology was the primary value driver of the product technology intangible resulting from the sdr acquisition 
goodwill related to the sdr acquisition primarily represented the benefits we expected to receive from a centralized application development organization 
since we abandoned that strategy and eliminated most of the development resources acquired with sdr  management concluded the goodwill no longer had value 
we recognized a million impairment loss in the third quarter of representing the unamortized balances of goodwill and other intangible assets related to the sdr acquisition 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of we continued to evaluate the recoverability of capitalized software at nic technologies 
we determined that the expected future cash flows of nic technologies would not be sufficient to recover the capitalized software assets and million was expensed as an impairment loss in the fourth quarter of nic conquest due to developments arising in the second half of relating to nic conquest s decision to migrate to a common operating platform for its core ucc and corporations filing applications  we determined that the balance of revenues remaining to be recognized under certain fixed price application development contracts was not expected to cover anticipated costs of developing and implementing the related applications and accrued losses totaling approximately million in the third and fourth quarters of additionally  in the fourth quarter of  we decided to devote all resources to completing existing contracts and not actively market the solution to new customers in the foreseeable future 
based on this decision not to actively market the solution  we determined that the carrying value of capitalized software development costs relating to this business were not recoverable and had been impaired 
this assessment resulted in an impairment loss during the fourth quarter of of approximately million 
as a result of the decision to curtail marketing and the uncertainty regarding future sales of this solution  we concluded that the remaining unamortized balance of goodwill related to nic conquest was impaired and recorded a million impairment loss in the fourth quarter of idt during the second quarter of  we identified indicators of possible impairment of goodwill related to the idt acquisition 
the impairment indicators included  but were not limited to  the recent underperformance of this business relative to plan  the expected underperformance of this business as compared to projected future operating results  and nic s recent strategic refocusing on our core portal outsourcing business and away from our software and services businesses 
specifically  we determined that that the recent downturn in idt s financial performance was expected to continue and would not be temporary  as we previously expected 
this was a reversal of idt s historical trend of profitability  and was primarily attributable to government imposed contract delays and funding shortfalls on the part of governments with whom idt had contracted 
management reached the conclusion that it would not continue to support idt s business and decided to wind down idt s operations as expeditiously and cost effectively as possible 
accordingly  we concluded the remaining goodwill related to the idt acquisition no longer had value and recognized a million impairment loss in the second quarter of aol during the second quarter of  we identified indicators of possible impairment of the cash and warrant portions of the carriage fee paid and payable to aol pursuant the interactive services agreement between the company and aol 
beginning in the second quarter of  our share of revenues generated from aol s sale of advertisement through government guide had increased steadily on a sequential quarterly basis 
however  in the second quarter of  revenues from our aol business decreased precipitously as compared to recent quarters 
this was primarily a result of lower aol government guide advertising revenues due to weakness in the overall advertising market in general and the online advertising market in particular 
this drop in advertising revenues was in contrast to the growth in revenues our aol business had experienced historically 
additionally  based on recent discussions with aol personnel  we did not expect our aol business to achieve revenue growth consistent with the growth it had experienced historically 
aol had specifically noted in their filings with the sec at the time that they expected the weakness in the online advertising market to continue for the foreseeable future 
accordingly  we reduced the revenue forecast for our aol business for the remainder of and through the completion of our contract with aol in december management determined that the expected future cash flows of its aol business would not be sufficient to recover the cash carriage fee we would have recognized over the remaining term of the contract with aol 
through the second quarter of  we had made cash payments to aol totaling approximately million  with approximately  recorded as a prepaid expense at june   and had to pay the remaining  in a series of three quarterly installments ending in march additionally  management determined the future cash flows of this business would not be sufficient to recover the unamortized carrying amount of the fully vested warrants issued to aol  which totaled approximately million at june  the carrying amount of the fully vested warrants was previously recorded as an intangible asset in the consolidated balance sheet 
as a result  we recognized a million impairment loss in the second quarter of restructurings in september  we announced that our third quarter operating results would likely fall short of revenue and earnings estimates 
concurrent with this announcement  we announced the restructuring of our nic commerce and nic technologies businesses  the reorganization of our management team and the consolidation of our marketing efforts 
our lower than expected third quarter operating results were mainly attributable to our nic commerce and nic technologies businesses  which were affected by industry wide post yk delays in government decision making and sales cycles during the first half of these businesses were the main sources of shortfall versus expectations as a result of their management s ineffective forecasting and inadequate response to market signals that new business and revenues would be less than expectations and as a result of expenditures for sustained development  marketing and product delivery efforts to support these operations whose revenue and gross profit impact did not materialize as expected during the quarter 
our response to the inadequate performance of these businesses  both of which we had acquired since september  was to initiate a change in leadership  while simultaneously adjusting operational processes and resources to more appropriately size these operations to visible demand and more efficiently align them with other initiatives across nic 
the restructuring involved employee reductions in our marketing division and at our nic commerce and nic technologies businesses 
as a result  we incurred a pre tax charge of approximately  in the third quarter of relating to employee severance costs 
approximately  of this charge has been included in selling and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations and  related to nic commerce  which has been classified as a discontinued operation 
employee severance costs paid through december  totaled  with  paid in cash requirements for the restructuring were funded from available resources 
employee severance costs related to severance packages for employees in marketing  product development and administration  of which were terminated by december   with two additional terminations made in in addition to the management and organizational changes that had taken place at nic commerce since the third quarter of as discussed above  during the fourth quarter of  we continued to evaluate the viability of our eprocurement business 
we determined it was unlikely that nic commerce s colorado utah project would continue beyond the pilot phase of production 
this  among other factors  led the company to determine that the nic commerce business would need to be downsized further in as a result  we incurred a pre tax charge of approximately  in the fourth quarter of relating primarily to employee severance and lease abandonment costs 
this charge is included in nic commerce s results as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations 
at december    remained accrued for future payments 
cash requirements for the restructuring were funded from available resources 
employee severance costs totaling approximately  related to severance packages for nine employees in administration and development  and all terminations were completed and payments made by the end of the first quarter of discontinued operations and reclassifications as further discussed above  in the second quarter of  we exited our domestic eprocurement business and have classified the results of operations of nic commerce as discontinued operations for all periods presented 
also  in  we decided to combine the general and administrative operating expense classification and the sales and marketing operating expense classification into one operating expense classification referred to as selling and administrative 
all periods presented reflect the new classification 
comparison of years ended december   and in this section  we are providing more detailed information about our operating results and changes in financial position over the past three years

in the analysis below  we have categorized our portal revenues according to the underlying source of revenue in thousands 
portal revenue analysis dmv transaction based    non dmv transaction based    portal management    software development   total    portal revenues for increased over of this increase  was attributable to revenues from our newer state portal business units that had a full year of operations in  including our idaho and tennessee portals  which began to generate dmv revenues in early  our hawaii and montana portals  which began to generate dmv revenues in the third quarter of  and our oklahoma and rhode island portals  which began to generate dmv revenues in the first quarter of approximately of the increase in portal revenues for was attributable to an increase in same state portal revenues states in operation and generating dmv revenues for two full years and was attributable to our local portals 
excluding our state portals that operate under fixed price models  same state portal revenues for increased over as a result of increased transaction volumes mainly from our arkansas  indiana  kansas and utah portals 
portal revenues for increased over of this increase  was attributable to revenues from our portals that became operational in  was from an increase in revenues relating to same state portal volumes and was attributable to our local portals

cost of portal revenues 
cost of portal revenues in increased over an increase in costs from our newer state portals that had a full year of operations in was partially offset by a decrease in same state cost of portal revenues 
same state cost of portal revenues in decreased from primarily as a result of strong overhead cost containment efforts 
our portal gross profit rate increased to in from in this increase was primarily attributable to our newer state portals that had a full year of operations in as discussed above  and to an increase in our same state portal gross profit rate  which increased to in from in this increase was due primarily to increased business and citizen adoption of existing portal applications and the addition of new revenue generating applications and services within existing portals through a relatively fixed cost base 
we intend to continue to expand our portal operations by developing and promoting new applications and services within our existing portals 
accordingly  we expect our same state gross profit rate to continue to increase in the foreseeable future 
cost of portal revenues in increased over of this increase  was attributable to costs from our state portals that became operational in  was attributable to our local portals  the majority of which became operational in  and was attributable to an increase in same state cost of portal revenues 
same state cost of portal revenues in increased over primarily as a result of technology enhancements and service delivery investments mainly in our indiana  maine and utah portals

software and services revenues 
software and services revenues for increased over this increase was primarily attributable to an increase in revenues from our corporate filings business  nic conquest  which benefited from its five year  million contract with the california secretary of state to develop and implement a comprehensive information management and filing system  and to a lesser extent from our ethics elections business  which benefited from the commencement of its five year  million contract with the state of michigan in january  and our aol business 
total corporate filings revenues increased by million in in  we recognized approximately million in revenue from our contract with the california secretary of state compared to million in these increases were offset by a decrease in revenues from legacy corporate filing contracts and our transportation business  idt  which we have decided to close 
as previously announced  we anticipate a significant decrease in revenues from our aol business in as compared to prior periods due to continued weakness in the online advertising market 
software and services revenues for increased over of this increase  was from idt  which we acquired in october  was from nic conquest  which benefited from its contract with the california secretary of state  and was from our aol business  which began to generate substantive advertising revenues subsequent to the launch of aol s government guide in march partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in revenues from our ethics elections business 
cost of software and services revenues 
cost of software and services revenues in decreased from cost of software and services revenues for  and include net charges of million  million  and million  respectively  for anticipated costs in excess of revenues to be recognized under certain of our fixed price application development contracts in our corporate filings business 
excluding these charges  cost of software and services revenues increased by in  which was consistent with the increase in software and services revenues in the current year 
of this increase  was attributable to our corporate filings business and the related development costs under its contract with the california secretary of state  and was attributable to our ethics elections business 
partially offsetting these increases were decreases from our aol business and our and idt business  which we have decided to close 
as further discussed above  in the second quarter  we determined that the expected future cash flows of our aol business would not be sufficient to recover the cash carriage fee and common stock warrant amortization expense we would have recognized over the remaining term of the contract with aol and recorded a million impairment loss 
as a result  the company no longer records the cash portion of the carriage fee expense in cost of software and services revenues 
total cash carriage fee expense recognized in cost of software and services revenues in was million compared to million in our software and services gross profit rate for was compared to in excluding the charges discussed above relating to our application development contracts  our software and services gross profit rate for was compared to in we anticipate a decrease in our software and services gross profit rate in due to the magnitude of our contract with the california secretary of state  which will comprise the majority of our software and services revenues and is being recorded at an expected gross profit rate of less than 
in addition  we anticipate decreased quarterly revenues and margins from our aol business due to continued weakness in the online advertising market 
cost of software and services revenues in increased from excluding the charges discussed above relating to our application development contracts  cost of software and services revenues in increased from of this increase  was attributable to our corporate filings business  was attributable to idt  which we acquired in october  and was attributable to our aol business  which commenced operations in the third quarter of partially offsetting these increases was a decrease in our ethics elections businesses as a result of cost containment and restructuring efforts and a decrease in revenues in selling and administrative 
selling and administrative expenses in decreased from contributing to this decrease was a reduction in expenses from our corporate filings  ethics elections and transportation businesses resulting from our restructuring and cost containment efforts in our software and services businesses over the past year  and from a general decrease in corporate level expenses 
throughout  we significantly curtailed public relations  brand image and advertising expenses and consolidated our sales and marketing efforts into one corporate level sales department to more appropriately match expenditures to expected market demand for our services 
selling and administrative expenses in decreased from in the second quarter of  the company incurred a one time charge of approximately million relating to our withdrawn secondary stock offering 
in the third quarter of  the company incurred a charge of approximately million for employee severance costs related to the corporate restructuring of our nic technologies divisions and the consolidation of our marketing efforts  as further discussed above 
the company also incurred a one time non cash charge of approximately million in the third quarter of due to the adoption of a company wide vacation policy that required the company to recognize a liability for earned but unused employee vacation 
excluding these charges  selling and administrative expenses for increased over excluding the charges discussed above  selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue were  and for  and  respectively 
we anticipate selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue to decrease to between and in we expect to accomplish this by reducing expenses relating to our software and services businesses and keeping corporate level expenses flat year over year 
impairment loss 
for additional information on the impairment losses we recorded in and  refer to the discussion above under impairment losses and restructuring charges and in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
stock compensation 
stock compensation for all periods consisted primarily of amortization of deferred compensation expense related to common stock options granted to senior level executives and other key employees in and in the second quarter of  we terminated two senior level executives causing certain of their unvested stock options to immediately vest pursuant to the terms of their option agreements 
as a result  we recognized all remaining deferred compensation expense relating to these two executives in the second quarter of at december   all deferred compensation expense had been recognized 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased significantly in compared to prior periods as we wrote off all remaining goodwill and purchase accounting intangible assets relating to our business combinations with sdr technologies  efed and conquest in the third and fourth quarters of in addition  we wrote off capitalized software development costs from our nic technologies  nic commerce and nic conquest businesses in the fourth quarter of in  we determined the future cash flows of our aol business would not be sufficient to recover the unamortized carrying amount of the fully vested warrants issued to aol and recorded a million impairment loss in the second quarter of we no longer record amortization expense relating to these warrants 
we expect amortization expense for to be approximately million  the majority of which will consist of the amortization of internal use capitalized software development costs 
total depreciation and amortization expense for is expected to range from to million 
operating loss 
operating loss for was million compared to million for and million for excluding non cash charges for impairment losses  stock compensation  depreciation and amortization and the one time charges in relating to the withdrawn common stock offering  corporate restructuring and vacation liabilities  operating income would have been million for compared to an operating loss of million for and an operating loss of million for management evaluates the performance of its business segments and allocate resources to them based on revenues and earnings before interest  taxes  equity in net loss of affiliates  depreciation  amortization  impairment losses  stock compensation and one time charges ebitda 
we believe that ebitda provides additional information for evaluating our ability to generate cash flow from operations 
ebitda is a commonly used financial measure but should not be construed as an alternative to operating income loss as determined in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  or gaap 
ebitda as determined by the company may not be comparable to ebitda as reported by other companies 
in addition  ebitda is not intended to represent operating cash flow as determined in accordance with gaap 
refer to note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k for further discussion of our reportable segments and the reconciliation of total reportable segment ebitda to total consolidated loss before income taxes and minority interest for the years ended december   and consolidated ebitda was positive million for compared to negative million for and negative million for ebitda from our outsourced portals segment was a positive million in and increased by approximately million from primarily due to same state ebitda growth  an improvement in our local portal ebitda  and positive contributions from our newer portals that had a full year of dmv revenues in including our hawaii  idaho  montana  oklahoma  rhode island and tennessee portals 
same state ebitda in increased by million  or  over  and ebitda from our local portals improved by million in as compared to ebitda from our outsourced portals segment was a positive million in and increased by approximately million from primarily due to same state ebitda growth and positive contributions from portals that became operational in including our hawaii  idaho  montana  oklahoma and tennessee portals 
in  our hawaii  idaho and tennessee portals were under development and incurred substantial start up losses 
same state ebitda in increased by million  or  over ebitda from our egovernment products segment  which consists primarily of our nic conquest  nic technologies and idt subsidiaries  was negative million in  negative million in and negative million in as further discussed under the analysis of cost of software and services revenues above  results from our nic conquest corporate filings business include net charges of million  million  and million in  and  respectively  for anticipated costs in excess of revenues to be recognized under certain of our fixed price application development contracts 
excluding these charges  ebitda for our egovernment products segment would have been negative million in and negative million for and the improvement in ebitda in was primarily attributable to a million improvement in ebitda from our nic technologies ethics elections business  which benefited from the commencement of its contract with the state of michigan in january  the renewal of its contract with the federal election commission  and the overhead cost reduction and restructuring efforts that have taken place in this business over the past two years 
positive ebitda from our aol segment for primarily reflects higher advertising revenues and decreased carriage fee expenses in the current year as compared to  as further discussed above 
in  we anticipate significantly decreased quarterly revenues and ebitda  as compared to  from our aol business due to continued weakness in the online advertising market 
corporate level expenses were million in  million in and million in the improvement in corporate level expenses over the past three years is further discussed under the analysis of selling and administrative expenses above 
interest income 
interest income primarily reflects interest income earned on our cash and marketable securities portfolio  which decreased to million at december  from million at december  and million at december  in addition  interest rates we earned in were less than in prior periods 
equity in net loss of affiliates 
equity in net loss of affiliates represents our share of losses of companies in which we have equity method investments that give us the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over the investees 
in the first quarter of  we invested in two private companies involved in the egovernment services industry  tidemark and e filing  primarily for strategic purposes 
in the fourth quarter of  we invested in egs  a private joint venture among swiss venture capital firm etf group  london based venture development organization vesta group  and our european subsidiary  nic european business ltd 
in the fourth quarter of  we incurred a noncash impairment loss of approximately million relating to our investment in tidemark 
in may  a private technology company acquired tidemark  which has not been reflected in our results of operations after the acquisition 
at december   our investment balance in e filing was approximately million and we had no investment balance remaining in egs 
as a result of a recent modification to the egs joint venture agreement  the company will account for its investment in egs under the cost method beginning in fiscal although e filing is incurring net losses  the losses are relatively small and the business has sufficient financial resources to continue to operate for a significant length of time 
we regularly review the carrying value of our equity method investments and record impairment losses when events and circumstances indicate that such assets are impaired 
to date  we have not recorded any such impairment losses on our investments in e filing or egs 
income taxes 
we recognized an income tax benefit in  and in  the income tax benefit approximated the amount customarily expected 
in  the income tax benefit was less than the amount customarily expected primarily because of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes including amortization of goodwill from the exchange offer  the conquest merger  the sdr acquisition and the idt acquisition  certain stock compensation costs and the goodwill relating to the sdr acquisition and conquest merger that was written off in the third and fourth quarters of as part of the intangible asset impairment charge 
in  the income tax benefit was less than the amount customarily expected because of expenses that are not deductible for tax purposes including amortization of goodwill from the exchange offer  the conquest merger  the sdr acquisition  the idt acquisition  and certain stock compensation costs 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was million for compared to million for the decrease in cash used in operating activities was primarily the result of a year over year reduction in our operating loss  excluding non cash charges  that was partially offset by a negative net change in operating assets and liabilities as compared to the prior year 
contributing to this negative net change was a decrease in accrued expenses in  including bonus payments made to our outsourced portal employees in april pursuant to a incentive compensation plan  employee severance payments made in relating to our discontinued eprocurement business  and payments in to subcontractors for project expenditures in our corporate filings business  including project expenditures related our contract with the california secretary of state 
the increase in accounts receivable and accounts payable in was mainly attributable to an increase in revenues from our portal business in  and more specifically to our hawaii  oklahoma and rhode island portals 
net cash used in operating activities was million for compared to million for the decrease in cash used in operating activities in was primarily the result of a positive net change in operating assets and liabilities as compared to the prior year and a year over year reduction in our operating loss  excluding non cash charges 
contributing to this positive net change in operating assets and liabilities was an increase in accrued expenses in  as further discussed above  and a decrease in prepaid expenses  primarily due to the amortization of the prepaid carriage fee under our arrangement with aol 
the increase in accounts receivable and payable for was primarily due to our hawaii  idaho  montana  rhode island and tennessee portals  all of which began to generate substantive revenues in we recognize revenue from providing outsourced government portal services net of the transaction fees due to the government when the services are provided 
the fees that we must remit to the government are accrued as accounts payable and accounts receivable at the time services are provided 
as a result  trade accounts receivable and accounts payable reflect the gross amounts outstanding at the balance sheet dates 
gross billings for the years ended december  and were approximately million and million  respectively 
we calculate days sales outstanding by dividing trade accounts receivable at the balance sheet date by gross billings for the period and multiplying the resulting quotient by the number of days in that period 
days sales outstanding for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
although we plan to generate net income in  we expect operating cash flow to be modestly negative through most of turning positive in late or early this reflects expected working capital swings from our corporate filings business due to continued legacy loss contract project expenditures and the terms of our five year contract with the california secretary of state  which back ends most of the larger payments 
at december   the loss accrual for all corporate filing application development contracts was approximately million  the majority of which will be expended in the first half of investing activities resulted in net cash generated of million in  reflecting million in net maturities of our marketable securities used for funding operations and for collateral purposes 
in conjunction with our contract with the california secretary of state  in march  we issued a million letter of credit as collateral for a performance bond required by the contract 
the letter of credit is fully collateralized by cash  which is restricted for this purpose 
investing activities in also reflect approximately million of capital expenditures and million in contributions to the egs joint venture 
investing activities resulted in net cash generated of approximately million in  reflecting million in net maturities of our marketable securities portfolio used for funding operations and for capital expenditures 
investing activities in also reflected approximately million in capitalized software development costs mainly from our nic commerce  nic conquest and nic technologies subsidiaries and approximately million in proceeds from the sale of property and equipment 
investing activities for resulted in net cash generated of million  reflecting million in net maturities of our marketable securities portfolio used for funding operations and for capital expenditures million  our business combination with conquest softworks  llc million  equity investments in tidemark million and e filing million  direct costs of the sdr acquisition million  our acquisition of idt million  and our investment in egs million 
investing activities for also reflected approximately million in capitalized software development costs mainly from our nic commerce and nic conquest subsidiaries 
net cash used in financing activities totaled approximately million in  primarily reflecting a million increase in restricted cash to collateralize our bank note payable and certain bank letters of credit issued on behalf of the company  million in payments under capital leases and million in payments to repurchase common stock 
remaining obligations under all capital leases will be paid in and are insignificant 
we received approximately million in from the exercise of employee stock options 
financing activities resulted in net cash generated of approximately million in  primarily reflecting million in cash proceeds from a bank note payable that we used to purchase certain hardware and software components for our eprocurement subsidiary 
net cash used in financing activities totaled million in  primarily reflecting million to pay off bank lines of credit assumed in the sdr million and idt million acquisitions  million in proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and issuances of common stock to employees  million in payments to repurchase common stock and million in payments under capital leases 
at december   our total unrestricted cash and marketable securities balance was million compared to million at december  at december   we had posted million in cash and all of our marketable securities as collateral for bank letters of credit issued on behalf of the company  our million bank line of credit in conjunction with a corporate credit card agreement  and our bank note payable 
we issue letters of credit as collateral for performance on certain of our government contracts and as collateral for certain performance bonds 
these irrevocable letters of credit are generally in force for one year 
we have explored a number of financing alternatives to provide us additional working capital flexibility and the resources to pursue opportunities that may accelerate our growth and profitability 
as further discussed in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements included in this form k  in october  we entered into an agreement with a bank to refinance all of our current letters of credit 
in addition  we obtained a million working capital line of credit and expect to refinance our term note payable in the near future 
in total  the new financing arrangement will increase our unrestricted cash balance by more than million by releasing funds which had been previously restricted as collateral to secure letters of credit and the note payable 
we will pledge approximately million of our cash and cash equivalents as collateral under the new financing arrangement and have given the bank a security interest in certain of our accounts receivable and other assets 
we have not yet completed all of these transactions with the bank 
our collateral requirements under this banking agreement may ease over time as we continue to pay down our bank note payable and post consecutive quarters of profitability and earnings growth 
however  even though we expect to be profitable in  we may not be able to sustain our current levels of profitability or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
we will need to generate sufficiently higher revenues while containing costs and operating expenses if we are to achieve growing profitability 
we cannot be certain that our revenues will continue to grow or that we will ever achieve sufficient revenues to become profitable on a long term  sustained basis 
if we are not able to sustain profitability in  our cash collateral requirements may increase 
had the company been required to post cash collateral at december  for the face value of all performance bonds which are supported by letters of credit  our line of credit in conjunction with a corporate credit card agreement and our bank note payable  unrestricted cash would have decreased and restricted cash would have increased by approximately million 
we believe that our currently available liquid resources will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements and current growth initiatives without the need of additional capital for the next twelve months and through the period when we expect to begin to generate substantive positive operating cash flow in either late or early although we expect to have net income in  we anticipate that our cash balances may decrease modestly throughout the year as a result of expected working capital swings from our corporate filings business as further discussed above 
however  any projections of future earnings and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
if our unrestricted cash  marketable securities and cash that may be generated from operations are insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity securities  issue debt securities  or increase our working capital line of credit 
the sale of additional equity securities could result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
there can be no assurance that financing will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to the company  if at all 
as discussed above  on certain government contracts we are bound by performance bond commitments 
however  we have never had any defaults resulting in draws on performance bonds 
we do not have off balance sheet arrangements or significant exposures to liabilities that are not recorded or disclosed in our financial statements 
while we have significant operating lease commitments for office space  those commitments are generally tied to the period of performance under related contracts 
the following table sets forth our future contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  in thousands less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations    long term debt obligations capital lease obligations purchase obligations other long term liabilities total contractual cash obligations    deferred tax assets at december   we have recorded net deferred tax assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes  totaling approximately million 
we estimate that we must generate at least million of future taxable income to realize those deferred tax assets 
we became profitable in the second half of we expect the company to be profitable and generate taxable income in and have focused the business on operations we believe have demonstrable ability to produce positive taxable income and cash flow in the future 
to achieve a sufficient level of future taxable income  we intend to pursue our current strategy of adding new government clients  broadening and standardizing our product and service offerings  and increasing transactional revenues from our existing government portals and filing applications 
based on information currently known to management  we believe it is more likely than not that the company will realize the deferred tax assets 
the table below reconciles loss from continuing operations before income taxes for financial statement purposes with taxable loss for federal income tax purposes in thousands year ended december  loss from continuing operations before income taxes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our short term investments in marketable debt securities and cash balances and the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we incur on our promissory bank note payable 
because our investments are in short term  investment grade  interest bearing marketable securities  we are exposed to minimal risk on the principal of those investments 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and investment risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
a change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows
