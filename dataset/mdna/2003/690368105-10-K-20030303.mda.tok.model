item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is one of the largest independent bulk shipping companies in the world 
the company s operating fleet consists of vessels aggregating million deadweight tons  including vessels that are owned by joint ventures in which the company has an average interest of 
an additional vlcc and two additional aframaxes are scheduled to be delivered in the next months 
operations the company s revenues are highly sensitive to patterns of supply and demand for vessels of the size and design configurations owned and operated by the company and the trades in which those vessels operate 
rates for the transportation of crude oil and refined petroleum products from which the company earns a substantial majority of its revenue are determined by market forces such as the supply and demand for oil  the distance that cargoes must be transported  and the number of vessels expected to be available at the time such cargoes need to be transported 
the demand for oil shipments is significantly affected by the state of the global economy and level of opec s exports 
the number of vessels is affected by newbuilding deliveries and by the removal of existing vessels from service  principally because of scrapping 
the company s revenues are also affected by the mix of charters between spot voyage charter and long term time charter 
because shipping revenues and voyage expenses are significantly affected by the mix between voyage charters and time charters  the company manages its vessels based on tce revenues 
management makes economic decisions based on anticipated tce rates and evaluates financial performance based on tce rates achieved 
set forth in the tables below are daily tce rates that prevailed in various markets in which the company s vessels operated for the periods indicated 
in each case  the rates may differ from the actual tce rates achieved by the company in the period indicated because of the timing and length of voyages and the portion of revenue generated from long term charters 
it is important to note that the spot market is quoted in worldscale rates 
the conversion of worldscale rates to the following tce rates necessarily required the company to make certain assumptions as to brokerage commissions  port time  port costs  speed and fuel consumption  all of which will vary in actual usage 
foreign flag vlcc segment spot market tce rates vlccs in the arabian gulf q q q q average        high        low        for  spot freight rates for modern vlccs trading east and west out of the arabian gulf averaged  per day  which is lower than the average for and lower than the average for freight rates  which had declined steadily on a quarter to quarter basis during  continued this downward trend for the first three quarters of as opec implemented a fourth reduction in production quotas effective from january  while reductions in iraqi production during the second quarter led to lower exports from its mediterranean terminal at ceyhan  other opec producers  particularly in the arabian gulf  increased exports with an accompanying temporary beneficial effect on vlcc freight rates 
as a result  rates spiked to  per day during the second quarter but thereafter plunged to a low of just  per day during the third quarter 
concerns about armed conflict with iraq were exacerbated in the second half of by the terrorist attack on a vlcc off yemen in october and the terrorist bombing in bali 
as a result  demand for crude oil increased in anticipation of an imminent supply disruption during the year s final quarter 
global economic activity also increased as the year progressed  reversing the year on year decline in oil demand and increasing demand for tankers 
despite opec maintaining its production quota throughout  over production increased as the year progressed and in the fourth quarter opec production was above established quotas 
in december  opec increased its production by million b d effective from january  in an effort to legitimize and limit this over production 
these factors combined with reduced availability of tonnage in the arabian gulf resulted in a surge in freight rates during the fourth quarter to a high of  per day reached in mid december and an average rate of  per day 
since the vlcc market predominantly entails longer haul voyages  in a rising rate environment  such as that which prevailed in the fourth quarter  there is typically a lag before an increase in rates is fully reflected in actual operating results 
a general strike in venezuela that started in early december  has significantly reduced oil production and exports from venezuela 
accordingly  exports of oil to the us  its major market  have been sharply curtailed 
the north sea  west africa and the middle east have increased shipments to the us to offset this shortfall with a resulting rise in rates in each of these trades 
rates in the caribbean trades fell markedly in december  and many vessels ballasted across the atlantic to take advantage of the higher rates that prevailed in the north sea and mediterranean trades 
opec agreed to raise production quotas by million b d effective from february to offset this shortfall in venezuelan exports 
the resulting increase in long haul imports into the us has raised demand for vlcc tonnage  in particular 
foreign flag aframax segment spot market tce rates aframaxes in the caribbean q q q q average        high        low        aframax freight rates have derived support from increasing crude oil exports from the former soviet union fsu  which have increased by over and largely utilize aframax and suezmax tonnage 
in december  the venezuelan strike effectively closed all ports in that country and rates in the caribbean market fell significantly to a low of  per day in conjunction with the reduction in available cargoes 
for the first ten months of the year  average crude oil imports into the us from the caribbean region colombia  venezuela  trinidad and mexico rose by just over the average for this modest increase was more than offset by a reduction of in long haul crude oil imports from the middle east  which although principally impacting the vlcc market  reduced the demand for aframaxes in lightering operations in the us gulf 
us imports of north sea oil rose by  most of which is carried in aframax tankers 
as a result  rates for aframaxes operating in the caribbean trades in averaged  per day  a decline of from the level and from the average 
caribbean freight rates reached a low of just  per day during the third quarter  but rose rapidly to reach  per day in early november  due largely to a limited availability of tonnage 
a number of vessels normally available for trading had been chartered for use in lightering operations in the us gulf as long haul imports into the us increased 
at the start of the fourth quarter  the turkish authorities imposed stricter regulations on vessels transiting the bosphorus strait and rates in this region rose to compensate for the resulting delays 
the sinking of the single hull  built prestige in mid november has led to an increased preference on the part of many charterers for modern double hull vessels  especially for trades involving the european region 
these factors reduced availability of suitable vessels  contributing to the rise in rates in the north sea and mediterranean trades in the fourth quarter 
foreign flag product carriers segment spot market tce rates panamaxes in the pacific and bostonmaxes in the caribbean q q q q panamax average        panamax high        panamax low        bostonmax average        bostonmax high        bostonmax low        rates for panamax product carriers in were weak in comparison to the two previous years  with rates in the pacific averaging only  per day in  a decline of from the average and from the average 
rates in the first half of the year were particularly weak  reflecting a year over year reduction in deliveries of refined products to japan 
longer haul imports from the middle east were replaced by shorter haul supplies from non oecd countries in asia primarily china  india and singapore reducing ton mile demand and placing additional pressure on rates 
in the second half of the year  however  rates staged a modest recovery as japanese fuel oil imports for oil fired power generation compensated for shortfalls in nuclear power generation attributable to technical difficulties at a number of nuclear power stations 
additionally  petrochemical producers in the asian region stepped up imports to build up inventory levels in anticipation of potential supply disruptions from the middle east 
bostonmax product carrier rates similarly failed to match their levels  with rates averaging just  per day  below the average and below the average 
over the first ten months of the year  total us refined product imports fell by from the comparable period in almost of this decrease occurred in imports from the caribbean region  primarily venezuela 
rates reached  per day during the second quarter as us imports of gasoline peaked in anticipation of the start of the summer driving season 
overall refined product inventory levels in the us declined during the third quarter and heating oil inventories entered the winter approximately million barrels  or  lower than one year earlier 
consequently  us imports of heating oil surged during the fourth quarter as colder than normal weather blanketed the northeast 
the general strike in venezuela that started in december hobbled the venezuelan oil industry and initially caused caribbean rates to weaken 
caribbean product carrier rates  however  have subsequently improved as significant amounts of tonnage were repositioned to take advantage of higher rates available elsewhere 
towards the end of the fourth quarter  caribbean product carrier rates reached a high for the year of  per day 
critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require the company to make estimates in the application of its accounting policies based on the best assumptions  judgments  and opinions of management 
following is a discussion of the accounting policies that involve a higher degree of judgment and the methods of their application 
for a description of all of the company s material accounting policies  see note a to the company s consolidated financial statements set forth in item revenue recognition the company generates a majority of its revenue from voyage charters 
within the shipping industry  there are two methods used to account for voyage revenue and expenses percentage of completion and completed voyage 
the percentage of completion method is the most prevalent method of accounting for voyage revenues and expenses  and the method currently being used by osg 
under each method  voyages may be calculated on either a load to load or discharge to discharge basis 
prior to  osg accounted for voyage revenues and expenses using the completed voyage method  with voyages calculated on a load to load basis 
accordingly  osg did not recognize the revenues and expenses of voyages until vessels had completed their trips to the next load ports  and the company s revenues fluctuated from period to period because of the timing of voyage completions 
the change to the percentage of completion method  with voyages calculated on a discharge to discharge basis  eliminates these fluctuations since specific voyage results are allocated on a pro rata basis to the periods over which they are performed 
in applying the percentage of completion method  management believes that the discharge to discharge basis of calculating voyages more accurately estimates voyage results than the load to load basis 
since  at the time of discharge  management generally knows the next load port and expected discharge port  the discharge to discharge calculation of voyage revenues and expenses can be estimated with a greater degree of accuracy 
in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  osg does not begin recognizing voyage revenue until a charter has been agreed to by both the company and the customer  even if the vessel has discharged its cargo and is sailing to the anticipated load port on its next voyage 
vessel lives and impairment the carrying value of each of the company s vessels represents its original cost at the time it was delivered or purchased less depreciation calculated using an estimated useful life of years from the date such vessel was originally delivered from the shipyard 
in the shipping industry  use of a year life has become the standard 
the actual life of a vessel may be different 
the company has evaluated the impact of the revisions to marpol regulation g on the economic lives assigned to the tankers in the company s foreign flag fleet 
current regulations will not require that any of the single hulled or double sided foreign flag tankers be removed from service prior to attaining years of age 
the carrying values of the company s vessels may not represent their fair market value at any point in time since the market prices of second hand vessels tend to fluctuate with changes in charter rates and the cost of newbuildings 
both charter rates and newbuilding costs tend to be cyclical 
the company records impairment losses only when events occur that cause the company to believe that future cash flows for any individual vessel will be less than its carrying value 
market value of marketable securities in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  the company s holdings in marketable securities are classified as available for sale and  therefore  are carried on the balance sheet at fair value determined by using period end sales prices on us or foreign stock exchanges with changes in carrying value being recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss until the investments are sold 
accordingly  these changes in value are not reflected in the company s statements of operations 
if  however  pursuant to the provisions of fas and staff accounting bulletin no 
 the company determines that a material decline in the fair value below the company s cost basis is other than temporary  the company records a noncash impairment loss as a charge in the statement of operations in the period in which that determination is made 
as a matter of policy  the company evaluates all material declines in fair value for impairment whenever the fair value of a stock has been below its cost basis for six consecutive months 
in the period in which a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  the carrying value of that security is written down to its fair value at the end of such period  thereby establishing a new cost basis 
based on a number of factors  including the magnitude of the drop in market values below the company s cost bases and the length of time that the declines have been sustained  management concluded that declines in fair value of securities with an aggregate cost basis of  including  attributable to securities in the capital construction fund  were other than temporary 
during the third and fourth quarters of  the company recorded pre tax noncash impairment losses aggregating  related to such marketable securities  including  related to securities held in the capital construction fund 
these impairment losses are reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the fair value of certain other marketable securities have declined below the company s cost bases in those securities 
see note f to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item for additional information on pre tax unrealized losses as of december  certain of these securities have had fair values below their carrying values for more than six months 
the company has evaluated the circumstances surrounding the declines in market values as of december  and believes that these declines are temporary and  accordingly  continues to record the net after tax unrealized losses in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
if  however  the market values of these securities do not recover in the near term  the declines may then be considered other than temporary  which would result in impairment charges to earnings in future periods  which charges previously have been included in accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
drydocking within the shipping industry  there are three methods that are used to account for drydockings capitalize drydocking costs as incurred deferral method and amortize such costs over the period to the next scheduled drydocking  accrue the estimated cost of the next scheduled drydocking over the period preceding such drydocking  and expense drydocking costs as incurred 
since drydocking cycles typically extend over two and a half years or longer  management believes that the deferral method provides a better matching of revenues and expenses than the expense as incurred method 
the company further believes that the deferral method is preferable to the accrual method because estimates of drydocking costs can differ greatly from actual costs and  in fact  anticipated drydockings may not be performed if management decides to dispose of the vessels before their scheduled drydock dates 
deferred tax assets and valuation allowance the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets is based on the assumption that the company will generate sufficient taxable income in the future in order to permit the company to take deductions and use tax credit carryforwards 
the deferred tax assets are net of a valuation allowance 
as of december   the company recorded a valuation allowance of  related to capital losses arising from the write down of certain marketable securities 
management believes that it is more likely than not that a portion of the capital losses may expire unused because the generation of future taxable capital gains cannot be assured 
if these assumptions and estimates change in the future  the company could be required to increase the valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets  which will result in additional income tax expense in the company s statement of operations 
each quarter  management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the need for changes to the valuation allowance 
pension and other postretirement benefits the company has recorded pension and other postretirement benefit costs based on complex valuations developed by its actuarial consultant 
these valuations are based on key estimates and assumptions related to the discount rates used and the rates expected to be earned on investments of plan assets 
osg is required to consider market conditions in selecting a discount rate that is representative of the rates of return currently available on high quality fixed income investments 
a higher discount rate would result in a lower benefit obligation and a lower rate would result in higher benefit obligation 
the expected rate of return on plan assets is management s best estimate of expected returns 
a decrease in the expected rate of return will increase future net periodic benefit costs and an increase in the expected rate of return will decrease future benefit costs 
as of december   management reduced the discount rate and the rate of return on plan assets by and  respectively 
changes in pension and other postretirement benefit costs may occur in the future as a result of changes in these rates 
special purpose entity spe in  the company facilitated the creation of an spe that purchased from and bareboat chartered back to the company five us flag crude tankers that were being time chartered to bp for the transportation of alaskan crude oil 
the purchase price of million was financed by a term loan from a commercial lender and a substantive equity capital investment by the owner of the spe 
the company did not guarantee the vessels residual values or guarantee the spe s debt 
the company immediately thereafter bareboat chartered the vessels to a joint venture in which it has a interest 
the joint venture  in turn  has time chartered the vessels to bp under a hell or highwater lease through the date on which they must be removed from service in accordance with opa the portion of the charter hire payments from bp to the joint venture representing bareboat charter hire to the company is sufficient to fully amortize the debt of the spe 
such payments have been assigned to the spe 
the company has not consolidated the spe 
as of december   total assets and total liabilities on the books of the spe were million and million  respectively 
on july   the company expects to consolidate this spe in accordance with fasb interpretation no

the vlcc segment includes two vessels that were time chartered out during the three years ended december  the charter on one of these vessels expired at the end of february  at which time the vessel commenced participation in the tankers pool 
the following table presents information for the vlccs generating revenue in the spot market

the increase in revenue days resulted from the delivery of three newbuilding vlccs two in the second half of and one in early april 
running expenses increased by  to  in from  in the prior year as a result of an increase in ship operating days 
average daily running expenses  however  were relatively unchanged 
during  tce revenues for the vlcc segment decreased by  or  to  from  in because of a decrease of  per day in the average daily tce rate earned partially offset by an increase in the number of revenue days 
the increase in revenue days resulted from the delivery of two vlcc newbuildings in the second half of and the operation for all of of two vlcc newbuildings delivered in the first half of  partially offset by an increase in days spent repairing and drydocking the segment s vessels

during  tce revenues for the product carrier segment increased by  or  to  from  in because of an increase of  per day in the average daily tce rate earned partially offset by a decrease in revenue days resulting from the expiration in early of an operating lease on a chartered in vessel and an increase in days spent repairing and drydocking the segment s vessels 
running expenses decreased by  to  in from  in because of a decrease in ship operating days  partially offset by an increase of  in damage repair expenses involving two vessels 
us flag crude tanker segment tce revenues in for the us flag crude tanker segment were unchanged from because the segment s vessels are bareboat chartered at fixed rates to alaska tanker company atc 
during  tce revenues for the us flag crude tanker segment decreased by  to  from  in principally because of a reduction of the number of segment vessels from five to four 
this reduction resulted from the cancellation of both the bareboat charter in and bareboat charter out for one vessel that was sold by the owner of the spe in october in connection with bp s merger with arco 
us flag dry bulk carrier segment during  tce revenues for the us flag dry bulk carrier segment decreased by  or  to  from  in this reduction in tce revenues resulted from a day reduction in revenue days because of the sale of two vessels one in june and one in june offset by a decrease of days to days in from days in  in time waiting for cargoes 
this reduction in revenue days was partially offset by an increase of per day in the charter rates earned 
running expenses decreased by  to  from  in due to the sale of segment vessels discussed above 
average daily running expenses  however  were relatively unchanged 
during  tce revenues for the us flag dry bulk carriers segment decreased by  or  to  from  in because of lower charter rates  an increase of days to days in from in in time waiting for cargoes  and a day reduction in revenue days caused by the sale in of an older us flag product carrier that had participated in the us grain trade program since the beginning of running expenses decreased by  because of the vessel sale discussed above 
all other the company also owns and operates a us flag pure car carrier  two us flag handysize product carriers operating in the jones act trade  and a foreign flag suezmax  all on long term charter  as well as two foreign flag dry bulk carriers that operate in a pool of capesize dry bulk carriers 
during  tce revenues decreased by  or  to  from  in the reduction in tce revenues resulted from the company s reduced participation in the charter in of vessels that were commercially managed by the pool of capesize dry bulk carriers and a day decrease in revenue days for drydockings in and a  per day decrease in tce rates earned by the two foreign flag dry bulk carriers 
during  tce revenues increased by  or  to  from  in principally because of the company s participation in the charter in of vessels that were commercially managed by the pool of capesize dry bulk carriers 
running expenses similarly increased because of the charter in expense attributable to such vessel interests 
the increase in tce revenues earned in by the two us flag product carriers  which commenced long term charters in that year  was offset by significantly weaker results from the two foreign flag dry bulk carriers 
the average daily rates paid with respect to the chartered in vessels discussed in the two preceding paragraphs were higher than the tce rates earned by such vessels during and accordingly  the reduced participation in the charter in of vessels positively affected consolidated income from vessel operations by  in compared with since december  the pure car carrier has received payments of  per year under the us maritime security program  which continues through late  subject to annual congressional appropriations 
general and administrative expenses during  general and administrative expenses decreased by  to  from  in principally due to a decrease in cash compensation and related benefits 
such reductions were principally attributable to the new york headquarters staff reductions discussed in note o to the consolidated financial statements set forth in item during  general and administrative expenses decreased by  to  from  in because of a decrease of  in cash compensation and related benefits  partially offset by increases of  in non cash stock compensation and  in net periodic pension and other postretirement plan costs 
equity in income of joint ventures as of december   the company is a partner in joint ventures that own foreign flag vessels ten vlccs and one aframax 
as of december   eight of these vlccs participate in the tankers pool and two operate on long term charters  one to osg and one to the other joint venture partner  a major oil company  and do not participate in the tankers pool 
the aframax participates in aframax international 
during the three years ended december   the company s various joint ventures made the following acquisitions o in march  one vlcc in which the company has a interest 
o in june  one aframax in which the company has a interest 
o in march  two vlccs in which the company has a interest 
o in the third quarter of  three vlccs in which the company has a interest 
o in february and july  two vlcc newbuildings in which the company has a interest 
the following is a summary of the company s interest in all of its joint ventures  excluding atc see discussion below  and the revenue days for the respective vessels since their acquisition date 
revenue days are adjusted for osg s percentage ownership in order to state the revenue days on a basis comparable to that of a wholly owned vessel 
for the joint venture vlccs operating in the tankers pool  the ownership percentage reflected below is an average as of december  the company s actual ownership percentages for these joint ventures ranged from to number of revenue days average ownership vlccs participating in tankers pool vlccs owned jointly with a major oil company aframax in aframax international pool total   additionally  the company is a partner in atc  a joint venture that operates ten us flag tankers transporting alaskan crude oil for bp 
the participation in atc provides the company with the opportunity to earn additional income in the form of its share of incentive hire paid by bp to atc based on atc s meeting certain predetermined performance standards 
during  equity in income of joint ventures decreased by  to  from  in  principally due to a decrease in average daily rates earned by the joint venture vessels 
the impact of this decrease in rates was partially offset by an increase in revenue days of joint venture vlccs participating in the tankers pool to in from in  resulting from the delivery since january  of seven vessels 
in addition  the company s share of incentive hire earned by atc in decreased by  from during  equity in income of joint ventures increased by  to  from  in  principally because of the inclusion of the earnings of vessels acquired by joint ventures as discussed above and an increase in incentive hire earned by atc 
of the total increase   resulted from the acquisition of six vlccs from march to august  all of which have joined the tankers pool  as reflected by the increase in revenue days to days in from days in the increase in the company s share of incentive hire earned by atc amounted to  an increase of  resulted from the operation of the aframax for the full year in  as reflected by the increase in revenue days to days from days in interest expense the components of interest expense are as follows in thousands in thousands for the year ended december  interest before impact of swaps and capitalized interest    impact of swaps    capitalized interest    interest expense    during  interest expense increased by  to  from  in as a result of an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding of  and a reduction of   in compared with  in in interest capitalized in connection with vessel construction 
such increases were offset by a decrease of basis points in the average rate paid on floating rate debt to in from in the impact of this decline in rates was substantially offset by the impact of floating to fixed interest rate swaps that increased interest expense by  in compared with an increase of  in during  interest expense decreased by  to  from  in because of a decrease of basis points in the average rate paid on floating rate debt to in from in the impact of this decline in rates was partially offset by an increase in the average amount of debt outstanding of  interest expense reflects the impact of interest rate swaps that increased interest expense by  in and reduced interest expense by  in interest expense is net of amounts capitalized in connection with vessel construction of  in compared with  in provision credit for federal income taxes the credit for income taxes in and the income tax provisions in and are based on pre tax income loss  adjusted to reflect items that are not subject to tax and the dividends received deduction 
the credit for income taxes for also reflects the recording of a valuation allowance offset of  against the deferred tax asset resulting from the write down of certain marketable securities 
the valuation allowance was established because the company believes  based on currently available evidence  that it is more likely than not that the full amount of the deferred tax asset will not be realized through the generation of capital gains in the future 
effects of inflation the company does not believe that inflation has had or is likely  in the foreseeable future  to have a significant impact on vessel operating expenses  drydocking expenses and general and administrative expenses 
newly issued accounting standard in january  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this interpretation requires the consolidation of special purpose entities by the company that is deemed to be the primary beneficiary of such entities 
this represents a significant change from current rules  which require consolidation by the entity with voting control and according to which osg accounted for its sale leaseback transaction of us flag crude tankers as an off balance sheet financing 
on july   the company expects to consolidate the spe alaska equity trust that now owns these vessels and holds the associated bank debt used to purchase them 
the spe s bank debt of approximately  as of december  is secured by the vessels but is otherwise nonrecourse to osg 
in addition  osg did not issue any repayment or residual value guaranties 
therefore  osg is not exposed to any loss as a result of its involvement with alaska equity trust 
the company is currently analyzing the effect that the adoption of fasb interpretation no 
and the consolidation of alaska equity trust will have on its consolidated results of operations and financial position  but does not expect such effect to be material to net income 
liquidity and sources of capital working capital at december  was approximately  compared with  at december  and  at december  current assets are highly liquid  consisting principally of cash  interest bearing deposits  investments in marketable securities and receivables 
in addition  the company maintains a capital construction fund with a market value of approximately  at december  net cash provided by operating activities approximated  in compared with  in and  in net cash provided by operating activities in reflects  of payments with respect to estimated federal income taxes 
current financial resources  together with cash anticipated to be generated from operations  are expected to be adequate to meet financial requirements in the next year 
as of december   the company s total debt  including capital lease obligations  was  compared with  at december  the aggregate principal payments required to be made during the five years subsequent to december  are        and  
in december  osg concluded a new five year unsecured revolving credit agreement that provides for borrowings of up to  which was increased to  in january during syndication
