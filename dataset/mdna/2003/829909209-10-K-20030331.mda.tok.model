item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read together with our financial statements and the related notes contained elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview we are a semiconductor company that designs  manufactures and markets  high performance analog ics that are used primarily by oems operating in the computing  communications and networking infrastructure markets 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those significant estimates that are particularly susceptible to change  which include revenue recognition  sales returns  inventory reserves  restructuring and impairment  and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
we have identified the accounting policies below as the policies most critical to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results 
revenue recognition 
we record revenue to our largest distributor at the time the product is sold through to the end user sell through 
for all other product sales  assuming all other revenue recognition criteria have been met  revenue is recognized at the time of shipment because these distributors customers have no price protection and have limited return rights 
in addition  management believes that it is able to estimate and establish appropriate reserves for future returns from these distributors 
for product sales recognized at the time of shipment  sipex accrues for estimated sales returns upon shipment based upon our estimates of future returns 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began deferring revenue on ordinary course shipments to our largest distributor until the product is resold by the distributor to the end user because the arrangement with this distributor includes price concessions and return rights  the potential impact of which we believed we could no longer reasonably estimate 
in the fourth quarter of  sipex accepted distributor orders from our largest distributor for certain products on a discounted basis for which the distributor has no rights of return other than for product related issues  price protection or cancellation rights and which are not governed by the terms of the existing distributor contract 
revenue from these orders was recognized at the time of shipment  since these orders are non cancelable  non returnable and for which such sales are not subject to the terms of the company s distribution agreement with the distributor  including without limitation the price protection  restocking and other returns rights the distributor is entitled to in the agreement 
revenue from engineering service contracts is recorded as performance is completed 
sales returns 
to estimate reserves for future sales returns  we regularly review our history of actual returns for each major product line 
we also communicate monthly with our channel partners to gather information about sell through activity  end user satisfaction and to determine the volume of inventory in the channel 
we use the results of this analysis to estimate the reserves for sales returns 
we adjust our reserves for future returns as necessary  based on returns experience  returns expectations and our communications with our channel partners 

table of contents in estimating reserves  we also consider unusual events and market conditions 
it is possible that future events such as the introduction of a competitive product  product obsolescence  price competition  continued slowness in the semiconductor industry and distributors desire to decrease levels of inventory in the distribution channel could result in significant changes in customer demand and cause future returns to increase beyond historical levels 
management believes that it is able to estimate returns  and establish appropriate reserves for returns from customers for which sipex recognizes revenue as of shipment  using the process described above 
however  since reserves for estimated sales returns are recorded as a reduction in revenues  any significant difference between our estimated and actual returns experience  or changes in our estimate of reserves for future returns  would be reflected in our reported revenues in the period we determine that difference  and could have a material impact on our future results of operations 
inventory reserves 
we establish inventory reserves for estimated excess quantities  obsolescence or unmarketability 
in addition  the company establishes estimates to write down inventory costs to the lower of cost or market 
the excess and obsolescence reserve is calculated by comparing current inventory to both anticipated future demand and shipment history 
lower of cost or market adjustments are determined by reviewing shipments during the quarter and comparing standard cost to anticipated market pricing 
inventories are written down to the lower of cost or market which becomes the cost basis 
in establishing the reserves and estimating anticipated market pricing  we also consider current market conditions  industry performance  distributor inventory levels and sales to end users and all other relevant factors 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
reviews of the adequacy of inventory reserves are performed on a quarterly basis 
in  we recorded a million provision for excess and slow moving inventory  which included a million charge relating to product lines sold or discontinued as part of the company s third quarter restructuring plan and a  charge for physical inventory adjustments 
restructuring and impairment 
the determination of the estimated restructuring accrual and impairment requires significant management judgment 
to estimate the restructuring accrual  we prepare a plan that includes the number of employees to be terminated and the related severance cost  the amount of impairment for certain fixed assets and inventory  the termination costs of certain leases and the related actions required to execute the plan 
it is possible that future events such as voluntary employee terminations  sublease agreements or a shift in the timing of the execution of the plan could result in significant changes to the original estimate 
sipex reviews long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles  including goodwill  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
in estimating future net cash flows  management makes certain assumptions including future sales levels  gross profit margins and expense levels 
the future net cash flows can vary from management estimates due to unforeseen circumstances which may result in an impairment or additional impairment charges required to be recognized in the income statement 
we accounted for restructuring charges prior to january   in accordance with emerging issues task force bulletin eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring and sec staff accounting bulletin no 
sab  restructuring and impairment charges 
under eitf  costs associated with restructuring activities are recorded as restructuring costs in the consolidated statement of operations 
in june the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  on january   the company adopted sfas no 
and at the time of adoption  there was no material impact on our financial position or results of operations  however  the company has not yet determined the implications of adoption on future results of operations 
income taxes 
in assessing the net realizable value of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become taxable 
management considers the scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
based upon the level of historical taxable income and projections for future taxable income over the periods in which the deferred tax assets are deductible  management believes that it is not 
table of contents more likely than not that the deferred tax assets at december  will be realized in the future 
we therefore established a full valuation allowance and incurred a tax charge for the full amount of deferred income tax asset of million for the year approximately  of the valuation allowance is attributable to stock compensation expense for tax purposes  the tax benefit of which  when realized  will be credited to shareholders equity 
results of operations for the periods indicated  the following table sets forth the percentage of net sales represented by the respective line items in our consolidated statements of operations 
years ended december  net sales cost of sales gross profit loss operating expenses research and development marketing and selling general and administrative restructuring impairment of fixed assets amortization impairment of goodwill total operating expenses income loss from operations other income expense  net income loss before income taxes fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily attributable to the continued global slowdown in the semiconductor technology end markets resulting in lower average selling prices 
the decreases were primarily in the hybrid  analog display and legacy product families 
these decreases were partially offset by increased sales in the power and optical storage families 
net sales for were also unfavorably affected by million in the first quarter of  which was related to a change in the timing of revenue recognition on sales to our largest distributor 
effective october   we began to recognize revenue on sales to our largest distributor when the distributor sells our products to end users sell through  rather than upon shipment of the product to the distributor 
as of december   there was approximately million of inventory shipped to this distributor for which we had recognized revenue prior to october  accordingly  our net sales for the fiscal year ended were impacted by that amount 
our net sales were also impacted by million of sales in the fourth quarter to our largest distributor on a discounted  non cancelable and non returnable basis  which were recorded as revenue upon shipment 
international net sales increased and domestic net sales decreased for the year ended december   as compared to international sales represented and of net sales for and  respectively 
the increase in the percentage of international sales in compared to was due to a decrease of million in domestic sales for  combined with a million increase in international sales 
geographically  sipex experienced sales growth of in the pacific rim and in japan  which was driven by our power and optical storage product families  while sales declined in europe and in the united states in gross profit loss 
gross loss was million or of net sales in  as compared to a gross loss of million or of net sales in the million deterioration resulted from the effect of decreased revenue due to lower average selling prices and increased inventory reserves  and was partially offset by lower manufacturing costs 
the gross loss in included million of inventory charges of which million was a fourth quarter cost adjustment and million was for excess and slow moving inventory  which included a million charge relating to product lines sold or discontinued as part of the company s third quarter restructuring plan and a  charge resulting from physical inventory adjustments 
of the million provision in  million was recorded in the fourth quarter 
the deterioration in gross margin was partially offset by improved yields in the second half of 
table of contents in  our wafer fabrication facility experienced lower capacity utilization and lower wafer fabrication yields 
in addition  we recorded provisions for slow moving and obsolete material of million  which included an inventory charge of million due to the sudden and significant decrease in forecasted revenue in our business experienced in the second quarter of research and development 
research and development expenses were million for both and  or and of net sales  respectively 
research and development expenses for included increased expenses for optical storage product startup costs in  offset by reduced process development expenses in the wafer fabrication facility 
the increase in research and development as a percentage of net sales in was primarily due to the decreased sales 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expenses were million and million for and  respectively  or and of net sales  respectively 
the absolute dollar decrease in marketing and selling expenses in  as compared to  was due to decreased sales representative commissions on lower net sales and the continued effect of cost savings measures implemented in the fourth quarter of the decrease as a percentage of net sales in was attributable to decreased sales representative commissions and continued cost savings measures  which were partially offset by the decrease in sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses were million and million in and  respectively  or and of net sales  respectively 
the million increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to severance costs of approximately  paid in the second quarter of to the company s former chief executive officer 
the increase as a percentage of net sales in was due to these costs and the decrease in sales 
amortization impairment of goodwill 
the company adopted sfas effective january   thereby discontinuing annual goodwill amortization of approximately  upon adoption of sfas  the company performed a goodwill impairment test and concluded that there was no indication of impairment and recorded no impairment charges as of january  in the second quarter of  the company experienced a significant reduction in the fair value of its common stock 
the fair value decrease was primarily related to the financial impact to sipex of the continued global slowdown in the semiconductor industry 
as a result  the company performed a goodwill impairment test in accordance with sfas the results of this impairment test indicated that the full amount of the company s goodwill of million was not recoverable and was written off 
during and  the company recorded goodwill amortization of  the proforma effects of the adoption of sfas on net income and earnings per share for the company for the year ended december  and are as follows in thousands years ended december  net income loss as reported goodwill amortization expense adjusted income loss basic income loss per share  as reported add back goodwill amortization expense proforma basic income loss per share diluted income loss per share  as reported add back goodwill amortization expense proforma diluted income loss per share 
table of contents restructuring  fixed asset impairment and inventory costs 
in september  sipex announced a plan to close the company s four inch wafer fabrication facility in san jose  california and change to a modified five day per week work schedule from the seven day per week schedule in the six inch wafer fabrication facility in milpitas 
these actions were taken to reduce the company s cost structure as a result of the continued slowdown in the semiconductor industry and to align the structure with our current business plan  which included the sale and discontinuance of the hybrid product line at the end of the third quarter and the discontinuance of the analog display product line which is expected to be completed by the end of the first quarter of these product families accounted for approximately million of net sales in the third quarter of these actions allow us to consolidate our operations and focus on our three core businesses consisting of serial interface  power management and optical storage 
below is a summary of the activity related to restructuring costs for fiscal years and in thousands restructuring fixed asset inventory costs impairment costs costs accrual balance incurred charges utilized adjustments to accrual accrual balance incurred charges utilized adjustments to accrual accrual balance general during  we recorded restructuring charges of million  million of fixed asset impairment charges and million of inventory reserve charges 
gross restructuring charges consisted of employee severance costs of  management reorganization charges of approximately million and accrued lease expenses of  for the company s san jose facility 
these gross restructuring charges were reduced in the fourth quarter for a  reversal in accrued lease costs for the company s san jose facility due to the sale of the analog display business in the first quarter of which included the assumption of the lease by the third party purchaser and a  decrease in employee termination costs 
fixed asset impairment charges for consisted of million to write down the value of the machinery and equipment in the san jose facility to its fair value  as a result of the closure of the san jose fabrication facility in the first quarter of  and million of fabrication equipment at the milpitas fabrication facility 
the million inventory reserve  which is recorded as cost of sales  was established to provide for the discontinued analog display and hybrid product families 
in the fourth quarter  the reserve was reduced by  due to the unexpected sale of a portion of the inventory 
restructuring the third quarter restructuring charges for the above actions were million  which consisted of  of severance costs related to a reduction in force of approximately employees at both manufacturing facilities  million of severance and related costs to six former management employees related to the company s plan to reorganize into six functional groups and facility costs of  consisting mainly of the remaining lease payments at the san jose fabrication facility 
in the fourth quarter of  sipex incurred restructuring costs related to the transfer of the company s backend test operations from the billerica  massachusetts  facility to subcontractors in malaysia 
the restructuring costs consisted of  of employee severance related costs for the workforce reduction of approximately employees and freight charges of  related to the million sale of the billerica test related machinery and equipment with a net book value of million 
accrued severance costs as of december  are planned to be paid mainly during the first half of 
table of contents impairment third quarter fixed asset impairment charges totaled million  consisting of million of fabrication equipment on the company s four inch and six inch manufacturing product lines at the milpitas fabrication facility and million for the write down to fair value of the machinery and equipment at the san jose fabrication facility which had been scheduled to be closed by the end of the first quarter of in the first quarter of  the san jose fabrication machinery and equipment  which had been written down by million  were sold to an unrelated third party 
the gain on the sale of the san jose fabrication machinery and equipment will be recorded upon collection of the cash due to the length of time and related uncertainties affecting their ultimate receipt 
during we recorded net restructuring charges of  consisting of  for severance payments related to the reduction of our workforce  partially offset by a reduction of  in the restructuring accrual  which was established in the fourth quarter of the reduction in was due to the sale of the calogic fabrication facility  which had been planned for closure in as a result of the sale  we reduced both the facility exit related and employee termination portions of the accrual due to the assumptions of the facility by the new owners who retained many of the employees to whom we had planned to pay severance costs 
other income expense 
other income expense  net was million and  in and  respectively 
the decrease in other income in was due primarily to decreased interest income as a result of the decrease in restricted cash in the second quarter of the restricted cash was used to purchase the land  building and equipment of the milpitas wafer fabrication facility 
income tax expense 
we recorded an income tax charge of million for  as compared to an income tax benefit of million for in the second quarter of  the company established a full valuation allowance for its deferred tax assets  which included significant net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the valuation allowance was established  as the company no longer believed that it is more likely than not that the net operating loss and tax credit carryforwards would be realized during the carryforward period 
this change in estimate during the second quarter of was based on updated evaluations considering historical taxable income levels and expectations of future taxable income 
for the year ended december   the company recorded an income tax benefit at a effective rate 
the company recorded the tax benefit for the period and the related increase in deferred tax assets  as it believed it was more likely than not  considering the level of historical taxable income and expectations for future taxable income  that the operating loss would be utilized in the future to offset taxable income 
fiscal year ended december  compared to fiscal year ended december  net sales 
net sales decreased to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in net sales was primarily due to the global slowdown in the semiconductor technology end markets resulting in lower shipment levels 
net sales were also reduced in by reductions in the selling price of some of our power management and interface products 
additionally  net sales were further reduced by the second quarter increase in reserves for returns of million  which was based upon our decision to authorize returns from certain distributors in excess of their contractual return privileges  due to continued slowness in the semiconductor industry 
year to date net sales were also affected by million in the first quarter of  which was related to a change in the timing of revenue recognition on sales to our largest distributor 
effective october   we began to recognize revenue on sales to our largest distributor when the distributor sells our products to end users sell through  rather than upon shipment of the product to the distributor 
as of december   there was approximately million of inventory shipped to this distributor for which we had recognized revenue prior to october   accordingly  our net sales for the fiscal year ended were impacted by that amount 
approximately of our net sales were derived from international customers in  as compared to in geographically  in  sales decreased in all regions except for europe  as compared to gross profit loss 
gross loss was million or of net sales in compared to gross profit of million or of net sales in the reduction in gross profit as a percentage of net sales in from was primarily due to the higher operating costs of the milpitas wafer fabrication facility  lower capacity utilization  lower wafer fab yield and the reduced selling prices on some of our power management and interface products as a result of the continued global slowdown in the semiconductor industry 

table of contents in the second quarter of  we announced that a continued softness in our business led to a reduction in the demand on our inventory 
during the several quarters preceding the announcement  we had expanded our internal fabrication facility and test operations in response to forecasts of significant revenue growth in our business 
however  we experienced significant customer deferrals of delivery dates and order cancellations 
these customer actions contributed to higher than normal levels of inventory  which based on current and forecasted demand  would not be consumed during the products life cycle 
as a result  we recorded an inventory charge of million due to the sudden and significant decrease in forecasted revenue in our business 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million and million in and  respectively  or and of net sales  respectively 
the reduction in research and development expenses in  as compared to  was due to cost saving measures taken due to the continued slowness in the semiconductor industry 
the reduction included decreases in bonuses and discretionary spending such as travel  which were offset by continued spending related to process development in the new wafer fabrication facility 
the increase as a percentage of net sales in was primarily due to lower sales 
marketing and selling 
marketing and selling expenses were million and million in and  respectively  or and of net sales  respectively 
the decrease in marketing and selling expenses in over was due to lower commissions due to decreased sales and lower discretionary spending such as travel and entertainment and was partially offset by increased advertising and additional sales resources in asia 
the increase as a percent of sales in was primarily due to lower sales 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses  including amortization of goodwill  were million and million in and  respectively  or and of net sales  respectively 
the decrease in general and administration expenses was due primarily to controls over spending  and decreased salaries and bonuses in the increase as a percent of sales in was due primarily to the lower sales 
restructuring costs 
below is a summary of the activity related to restructuring costs for fiscal years and in thousands restructuring costs accrual balance charges utilized adjustments to accrual accrual balance incurred charges utilized adjustments to accrual accrual balance during we recorded net restructuring charges of  consisting of  for severance payments related to the reduction of our workforce 
these charges were recorded as a result of the continued slowness in the semiconductor market  partially offset by a reduction of  in the restructuring accrual  which was established in the fourth quarter of the reduction in was due to the sale of the calogic fabrication facility  which had been planned for closure in as a result of the sale  we reduced both the facility exit related and employee termination portions of the accrual due to the assumptions of the facility by the new owners who retained many of the employees to whom we had planned to pay severance costs 
in fiscal  a million restructuring accrual  which was established in for the closure of the calogic facility  was reduced by  this reduction resulted from delaying the timing of the closure of the calogic facility to match the timing of the milpitas facility ramp up 
other income expense 
other income expense  net was  and million in and  respectively 
the decrease in other income was due primarily to interest expense in as a result of borrowings on our bank line of 
table of contents credit  decreased interest income as a result of the decrease in restricted cash in the second quarter of which was used to purchase the land  building and equipment of the milpitas wafer fabrication facility  which was formerly leased and a  increase in royalty expense due to the discontinuance of offsetting royalty income 
income tax expense 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million for compared to an income tax expense of million for  resulting in an effective income tax benefit rate of in compared to an effective tax expense rate of in the effective rate differs from the effective rate primarily due to the disproportionately larger impact of federal and state tax credits on the effective rate in financial condition  liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had available funds of million consisting of cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  as compared to million at december  net cash used in operations was million  million  and million in  and  respectively 
net cash used in operating activities in resulted primarily from a million net loss  of which million was non cash related  partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable  a million decrease in inventories and a million increase in accounts payable 
the significantly greater net loss in was largely due to the million non cash tax charge as a result of the establishment of a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred income tax assets  as compared to an increase of million of deferred income tax assets for the same period last year and million of fixed asset impairment charges in this increased net loss  which also included a million charge for goodwill impairment  a provision of million for uncollectable receivables and returns and allowances and a provision of million for excess and obsolete inventory  did not result in greater net cash used in our operations as the deferred tax charge  goodwill impairment  fixed asset impairment and provision for receivables are not cash items 
in  net cash used in operating activities resulted primarily from a million net loss  an million increase in deferred income tax assets  a million decrease in accounts payable  a million decrease in accrued expenses and a million decrease in other long term liabilities 
these cash outflows were partially offset by a million decrease in accounts receivable and a decrease in inventory of million 
net accounts receivable was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the million decrease was due to lower sales and improved collections for the fourth quarter to bad debt allowances were  and  as of december  and  respectively 
distributor reserves were  and million as of december  and  respectively 
the decrease was the result of improved inventory management and decreased inventory levels at the distributors 
net inventory was million and million as of december  and  respectively 
the million reduction in included charges of million  of which million was a fourth quarter cost adjustment and million was for excess and slow moving inventory  which included a million charge relating to product lines sold or discontinued as part of the company s third quarter restructuring plan and a  charge resulting from physical inventory adjustments 
the remaining decrease is the result of improved cycle times 
net cash used in investing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
additions to property  plant and equipment were million in  as compared to million in the expenditures in the period consisted mainly of the purchase of the land  building and equipment of our milpitas manufacturing facility for million in june  which was previously leased 
proceeds for the lease buyout in were provided by the liquidation of million of restricted cash 
additionally in  million was used for the purchase of short term investments offset by million received on maturities of short term investments 
net cash of million and million was provided by financing activities for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in the second quarters of and  we received cash of million and million  respectively  net of placement agent fees and other costs  through the private placements of million and million shares  respectively  of sipex common stock 
proceeds from the offering were used to pay down our line of credit to zero  with the balance to be used for general corporate purposes 
proceeds from the offering were used to pay down our line of credit to million from million at the end of the first quarter of  with the balance used to provide funding for operations 

table of contents on september   sipex sold a convertible secured note the note with an attached warrant to an affiliate of its largest distributor for an aggregate cash amount of million 
the company recorded the note at million and the warrant at million recorded to paid in capital based upon their estimated fair values at the date of issuance using the black scholes option pricing model 
the note pays a coupon and is convertible after one year into sipex common stock at a conversion price of per share 
following the one year anniversary of the issuance of the note  the company can require the conversion of the note in installments if for a period of time sipex common stock trades at a price in excess of of the conversion price of 
the private placement also included a warrant to purchase  shares of sipex common stock exercisable for a two year period beginning on the one year anniversary of the date of issuance 
the exercise price for the warrant is equal to of the average closing price for the days preceding the closing or 
the warrant has been recorded as an addition to paid in capital 
the discount on the note of million  recorded at the time of purchase  is being amortized over the five year term of the note and may be accelerated as a result of conversion 
the note matures on september  the note is secured by a deed of trust on the company s land and building in milpitas  california 
on april   the outstanding bank line of credit balance of million was paid down to zero using proceeds from the private placement of company common stock 
on september   the company terminated its line of credit agreement with its bank 
the bank s security interest in substantially all the company s assets was subsequently extinguished 
sipex s commitments and contingencies consist of the note discussed above  operating lease obligations and a potential contingent loss relating to a patent litigation suit with maxim integrated products  inc discussed below 
minimum payments under the commitment and contingencies as of december  are approximately as follows in thousands operating note calendar year lease payable total thereafter in february  sipex filed a lawsuit against maxim with the us district court for the district of massachusetts seeking a declaratory judgment that three of sipex s products did not infringe maxim patents 
maxim filed counterclaims alleging certain products sold by sipex infringe a maxim patent 
the counterclaims seek injunctive relief and unspecified damages 
sipex has denied infringement and alleges that the patent is invalid 
the results of any litigation or arbitration are inherently uncertain  and sipex can offer no assurance that in any future legal actions sipex will prevail 
if sipex does not prevail  we would be required to pay cash damages  injunctive relief could be issued which would prohibit sipex from selling the infringing product and liquidity could be adversely affected 
the company has accrued  toward a potential settlement 
we believe that our currently available cash and investments  combined with our cost reduction programs in process and the restructuring and reorganization that we have taken  will be sufficient to meet our cash and working capital requirements through at least december  we may need to raise additional funds if our estimates change or prove inaccurate  if our cost reduction initiatives are insufficient  for general working capital purposes  or to strengthen our financial position 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to sipex  as well as factors beyond our control  including the continued downturn in the semiconductor industry  volatility and uncertainty in the capital markets as well as continued market uncertainty related to the ongoing us war on terrorism and the war with iraq 
there can be no assurance that any financing will be available on terms acceptable to us  if at all  and any need to raise additional capital through the issuance of equity or debt securities may result in additional  and perhaps  significant dilution

and related interpretations 
factors affecting future results except for historical information contained herein  the matters set forth on this report on form k  including the statements in the following paragraphs  are forward looking statements that are dependent on certain risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  such factors as  among others  delays in new product and process technology announcements and product introductions by us or our competitors  competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in the mix or markets in which our products are sold  availability and costs of raw materials  reliance on subcontractors  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  industry wide wafer processing capacity  political and economic conditions in various geographic areas  and costs associated with other events  such as under utilization or expansion of production capacity  intellectual property disputes  litigation  or environmental regulation and other factors described below and elsewhere in this form k 
these risks and uncertainties are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also impair our business operations 
if any of these risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in such case  the trading price of our common stock could decline 
our quarterly and annual operating results are volatile and difficult to predict and may cause our stock price to fluctuate 
our quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect net sales and profitability from period to period  including the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry  competitive pressures on selling prices  the timing and cancellation of customer orders  the availability of foundry capacity  raw materials and assembly and test capacity  fluctuations in yields  changes in product mix  our ability to introduce new products and technologies on a timely basis  the introduction of products and technologies by our competitors  market acceptance of our products and our customers products  the level of orders received that can be shipped in a quarter  delays in shipments from our fabrication plant to assembly houses  our ability to manufacture in the correct mix to respond to orders on hand and new orders received in the future  the timing of investments in research and development  including tooling expenses associated with product development  process improvements and production  the level of future product returns  and the overall economic conditions in the united states and abroad  particularly as a result of the ongoing us war on terrorism and the war with iraq 
due to the absence of substantial non cancelable backlog  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and can fluctuate substantially 
our expense levels are based  in part  on expectations of future revenues and are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
our future revenues are difficult to predict and at times in the past we have failed to achieve revenue expectations 
we may be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
if revenue levels are below expectations for any reason  operating results are likely to be unfavorably affected 
we may also take steps to adjust our strategic product families and change our cost structure  which may result in our incurring additional restructuring  reorganization and other charges 
based on forecasts  we may increase our operating expenses for personnel 
table of contents and new product development and for inventory in anticipation of increasing sales levels  therefore  operating results would be worsened if increased sales are not achieved 
in addition  we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
since  the semiconductor industry has been experiencing a prolonged and severe downturn that continues to adversely affect our results of operations 
our net sales for the quarter and year ended december   decreased and from the corresponding prior year periods 
our business depends on market demand for products using analog semiconductors 
prolonged downturns in the semiconductor industry lead to decreases in net sales levels and may cause continued losses and cash flow shortages 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we may experience material fluctuations in future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could substantially negatively affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
we have been notified by our auditors that we have certain material weaknesses related to internal control processes and systems 
if we are unable to promptly and effectively implement adequate controls  systems and procedures  we may continue to experience weaknesses in our internal controls and operations that could call into question the accuracy of our financial results and we may be unable to achieve section certification as mandated under the sarbanes oxley act 
as a result of the december  audit of the consolidated financial statements  our auditors noted certain matters involving internal control and its operation that they consider to be material weaknesses under standards established by the american institute of certified public accountants 
material weaknesses are significant deficiencies in the design or operation of internal control that could adversely affect our ability to record  process  summarize and report financial data consistent with our assertions of management in the financial statements 
by definition  material weaknesses do not reduce to a relatively low level the risk that errors or fraud  in amounts that would be material in relation to the financial statements being audited  may occur and may not be detected within a timely period by employees in the normal course of performing their assigned functions 
the material weaknesses noted during the audit resulted from the deficiencies in the systems and processes used in the preparation of the financial statements and the lack of proper management review and account analysis in certain areas 
although other areas were impacted by the material weaknesses  the most significant issues arising from the material weaknesses included inappropriate process and systems tracking of inventory  including significant manual reconciliation  as well as inappropriate and insufficient analysis performed in evaluating inventory costs capitalized and inventory excess and obsolete reserves established 
to ensure appropriate analysis  we must systemize processes by establishing appropriate guidelines that will reduce the level of manual reconciliation as well as improve the account analysis methodologies and increase the level of supervisory and management review 
while we have identified and intend to take measures to improve our systems and internal control structure  implement more rigorous internal accounting and operational policies  procedures and controls  and conduct systems training  the success of these measures cannot be assured and will depend on many factors  including our ability to hire  train and retain additional qualified accounting staff 
our ability to implement our business plan successfully in a volatile market requires effective management systems and a system of financial processes and controls 
if we are unable to maintain an adequate level of processes and controls and improve our systems  we may not be able to accurately report our financial performance on a timely basis and our business and stock price would be adversely affected 
in addition  we may be unable to achieve section certification as mandated by the sarbanes oxley act 
we have recently experienced significant changes in senior management and our corporate organization 
a number of members of our senior management team  including our chief executive officer and president  senior vice president of operations  senior vice president of finance and chief financial officer  senior vice president  marketing and business development  vice president of engineering and vice presidents of sales for asia and the americas have joined our company since the second half of in particular  our chief financial officer  phillip kagel  joined sipex in february  after the audit of our financial statements for the year ended december  was substantially complete 
changes in management may be disruptive to our business and may result in the departure of existing employees and or customers 
in addition  during the third quarter of  we announced the restructuring and reorganization of the company into six functional groups reporting to our chief executive officer  as well as the sale of our hybrid product family 
it may take significant time to integrate our new management personnel and achieve efficiencies from our new corporate structure  which may adversely affect our business and operating results 

table of contents we may experience difficulties in developing and introducing new or enhanced products necessitated by technological advances 
our future success will depend  in part  upon our ability to anticipate changes in market demand and evolving technologies 
to remain competitive  we must enhance our current products and to develop and introduce new products that keep pace with technological advancements and address the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
our products may be rendered obsolete if we fail to anticipate or react to change  and  as a result  our revenues and cash flow may be negatively impacted 
our success depends on our ability to develop new semiconductor devices for existing and new markets  to introduce these products in a timely manner and to have these products selected for design into new products of our customers 
the development of these new devices is highly complex and from time to time we have experienced delays in completing the development of new products 
successful product development and introduction depends on a number of factors  including accurate new product definition  timely completion and introduction of new product designs  availability of foundry capacity  achievement of manufacturing yields  and market acceptance of our products and our customers products 
our success also depends upon our ability to accurately specify and certify the conformance of our products to applicable standards and to develop our products in accordance with customer requirements 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to adjust to changing market conditions as quickly and cost effectively as necessary to compete successfully 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to introduce new products in a timely and cost effective manner or in sufficient quantities to meet customer demand or that these products will achieve market acceptance 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that our customers products will achieve market acceptance 
we depend on distributors who sell directly to oems 
approximately of our net sales are from shipments of our product to distributors who sell directly to oems 
our agreements with distributors contain limited provisions for return of our product  including stock rotations whereby distributors may return a percentage of their product based upon a percentage of their most recent six months shipments except for future electronics  which is based on three months 
in addition  in certain circumstances upon termination of the distributor relationship distributors may return a percentage of purchases 
the loss of business from any of our significant distributors or the delay of significant orders from any of them  even if only temporary  could significantly reduce our income  delay recognition of revenue and impact our ability to accurately predict cash flow 
we estimate the amount of future returns and have established reserves for estimated returns based upon information including sales during the period into the distribution channel  reported sell through by distributors to oems  distributor inventory levels and the specific terms of the distributor agreements as well as historical returns experience 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we began deferring revenue on shipments to future electronics until the product is resold by the distributor to the end user sell through  because the arrangement with this distributor included price concessions and return rights the potential impact of which we believed we could no longer reasonably estimate 
we derive a substantial portion of our revenues from future electronics  and our revenues would likely decline significantly if future electronics elects not to make  cancels  reduces or defers purchases of our products 
future electronics has historically accounted for a significant portion of our revenues 
it is our largest distributor worldwide  and accounted for  and of total net sales  respectively  for the years ended december   and we anticipate that sales of our products to future electronics will continue to account for a significant portion of our revenues 
the loss of future electronics as a distributor  or a significant reduction in orders from future electronics would materially and adversely affect our operating results  our business  our financial condition and our stock price 
we have a distributor agreement with future electronics that provides for future electronics to act as our sole distributor for certain products within north america and europe 
sales to this distributor are made under an agreement that provides protection against price reduction for their inventory of sipex products 
sipex maintains a separate price list for products sold to future electronics  which reflects discounts from the prices charged to customers in direct sales 
table of contents transactions 
our distributor agreement with future electronics does not contain minimum purchase commitments 
as a result  future electronics could cease purchasing our products with short notice to us 
in addition  future electronics may defer or cancel orders without penalty  which would likely cause our revenues our business  our financial condition and our stock price to decline 
we may not successfully expand our sales and distribution channels 
an integral part of our strategy is to expand our sales and distribution channels 
we are increasing resources dedicated to developing and expanding these channels but we may not be successful doing so 
if we are successful in increasing our sales through indirect sales channels  we expect that those sales will be at lower per unit prices than sales through direct channels  and revenues we receive for each sale will be less than if we had sold the same product to the customer directly 
selling through indirect channels may also limit our contact with our customers 
as a result  our ability to accurately forecast sales  evaluate customer satisfaction and recognize emerging customer requirements may be hindered 
even if we successfully expand our distribution channels  any new distributors may not have the technical expertise required to market and support our products successfully 
if parties do not provide adequate levels of services and technical support  our customers could become dissatisfied  we could be required to devote additional resources for customer support  and our brand name and reputation could be negatively impacted 
our strategy of marketing products directly to our customers and indirectly through distributors may result in distribution channel conflicts 
our direct sales efforts may compete with those of our indirect channels and  to the extent different distributors target the same customers  distributors may also compete with each other 
although we have attempted to manage our distribution channels to avoid potential conflicts  channel conflicts may negatively impact our relationships with existing sales representatives or distributors or impair our ability to attract sales representatives 
we may face significant risks related to our international operations 
we derive a significant portion of our net sales from international sales  including asia  which are subject to certain risks  including unexpected changes in legal and regulatory requirements  changes in tariffs  exchange rates and other barriers  political and economic instability  difficulties in accounts receivable collection  difficulties in managing distributors or representatives  difficulties in staffing and managing international operations  difficulties in protecting our intellectual property overseas  the seasonality of sales  and potentially adverse tax consequences 
our international sales in and were million and million  respectively  or and of total net sales  respectively 
there can be no assurance that economic and geopolitical troubles in any area of the world will not have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our inability to meet any increase in demand could reduce our market share 
demand shifts in the semiconductor industry are rapid and difficult to predict  and we may not be able to respond quickly enough to an increase in demand  if any 
our ability to increase sales of our products depends  in part  upon our ability to optimize the use of our manufacturing capacity in a timely manner and  if necessary  expand our manufacturing capacity 
if we are unable to respond to rapid increases in demand  if any  for our products on a timely basis or to manage any corresponding expansion of our manufacturing capacity effectively  our customers could increase their purchases from our competitors  which would reduce our market share 
our financial results may be adversely affected due to the highly volatile optical storage market 
a significant component of the company s growth strategy depends on increasing shipments in the optical storage market 
during  we derived all of our optical storage sales from a limited number of customers in japan 
local 
table of contents suppliers in japan may have a competitive advantage over sipex  which could adversely affect our ability to grow sales or continue to compete in japan or other regions of the world 
any failure to increase our shipments in the optical storage market could limit our ability to grow our business and could adversely affect our operating results 
if we are unable to compete effectively with existing or new competitors  we will experience fewer customer orders  reduced revenues  reduced gross margins and lost market share 
we compete in markets that are intensely competitive  and which are subject to both rapid technological change and continued price erosion 
our competitors include many large domestic and foreign companies that have substantially greater financial  technical and management resources than us 
loss of competitive position could result in price reductions  fewer customer orders  reduced revenues  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which would affect our operating results and financial condition 
to remain competitive  we continue to evaluate our manufacturing operations  looking for additional cost savings and technological improvements 
if we are not able to successfully implement new process technologies and to achieve volume production of new products at acceptable yields  our operating results and financial condition may be affected 
in addition  if competitors in asia reduce prices on commodity products  it would adversely affect our ability to compete effectively in that region 
our future competitive performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to accurately identify emerging technological trends and demand for product features and performance characteristics  develop and maintain competitive products  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices  respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others  increase device performance and improve manufacturing yields  adapt products and processes to technological changes  and adopt and or set emerging industry standards 
there can be no assurance that our design  development and introduction schedules for new products or enhancements to our existing and future products will be met 
in addition  there can be no assurance that these products or enhancements will achieve market acceptance  or that we will be able to sell these products at prices that are favorable to us 
we have only limited protection for our proprietary technology 
the semiconductor industry is characterized by frequent litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
although we are not aware of any pending or threatened patent litigation that we consider material  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert claims against us with respect to existing or future products or technologies and we have been subject to such claims in the past 
in litigation to determine the validity of any third party claims  such litigation  whether or not determined in our favor  could result in significant expense to us and divert the efforts of our management personnel from productive tasks 
in the event of an adverse ruling in such litigation  we may be required to discontinue the use of certain processes  cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  expend significant resources to develop non infringing technology or obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
there can be no assurance that licenses will be available on acceptable terms  or at all  with respect to disputed third party technology 
in the event of a successful claim against us and our failure to develop or license a substitute technology at a reasonable cost  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be materially and adversely affected 
in february  sipex filed a lawsuit against maxim integrated products  inc maxim with the us district court for the district of massachusetts seeking a declaratory judgment that three of sipex s products did not infringe maxim patents 
maxim filed counterclaims alleging certain products sold by sipex infringe a maxim patent 
the counterclaims seek injunctive relief and unspecified damages 
sipex has denied infringement and alleges that the patent is invalid 
the results of any litigation or arbitration are inherently uncertain  and sipex can offer no assurance that in any future legal actions sipex will prevail 
if sipex does not prevail  we would be required to pay cash damages  injunctive relief could be issued which would prohibit sipex from selling the infringing product and liquidity could be adversely affected 
the company has accrued  toward a potential settlement 

table of contents there can be no assurance that foreign intellectual property laws will protect our intellectual property rights 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that others will not independently develop similar products  duplicate our products or design around any of our patents 
we may be subject to  or may initiate  interference proceedings in the us patent office  which can demand significant financial and management resources 
our future success depends on retaining our key personnel and attracting and retaining additional highly qualified employees 
our success depends upon the continued service of our executive officers and other key management and technical personnel  and on our ability to continue to attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel  such as experienced analog circuit designers 
the competition for these employees is intense 
most of our employees are employees at will and we have no fixed term employment agreements with most employees  which means that they can terminate their employment at any time 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain our design engineers  executive officers and other key personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of our design engineers  executive officers or other key personnel or our inability to recruit replacements for these personnel or to otherwise attract  retain and motivate qualified personnel could seriously impede our success 
our manufacturing processes are very complex  which may result in manufacturing difficulties 
our manufacturing processes are highly complex and are continuously being modified in an effort to improve yields and product performance 
process changes can result in interruptions in production or significantly reduced yields causing product introduction or delivery delays 
in addition  yields can be adversely affected by minute impurities in the environment or other problems that occur in the complex manufacturing process 
many of these problems are difficult to diagnose and are time consuming or expensive to remedy 
from time to time we have experienced unfavorable yield variances 
in particular  new process technologies or new products can be subject to especially wide variations in manufacturing yields and efficiency 
there can be no assurance that our foundry or those of our suppliers will not experience unfavorable yield variances or other manufacturing problems that result in delayed product introduction or delivery delays 
we rely on outside foundries to supply wafers and those foundries may not produce at acceptable levels 
we rely on outside foundries to supply fully processed semiconductor wafers 
this reliance on outside foundries presents the following potential risks lack of adequate wafer supply  limited control over delivery schedules  unavailability of or delays in obtaining access to key process technologies  and limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs 
additionally  the manufacture of integrated circuits is a highly complex and technologically demanding process 
our third party foundries have  from time to time  experienced lower than anticipated manufacturing yields  particularly in connection with the introduction of new products and the installation and start up of new process technologies 
there can be no assurance that our outside foundries will not experience lower than expected manufacturing yields in the future 
additionally  we do not have a guaranteed level of production capacity at any of these foundries 
the ability of each foundry to provide wafers to us is limited by the foundry s available capacity  and the foundry s allocation of its available capacity among multiple customers 
there can be no assurance that our third party foundries will allocate sufficient capacity to satisfy our requirements 
we have experienced decreased allocations of wafer supplies from our suppliers in the past  which reduced our capacity to ship products  and  thus  recognize revenues 
additionally  any sudden reduction or elimination of any primary source or sources of fully processed wafers could result in a material delay in the shipment of our products 
if any other delays or shortages occur in the future  our business and operating results will be negatively impacted 

table of contents our wafer fabrication facility and the facilities of certain of our significant customers and third party wafer suppliers are located in areas susceptible to earthquakes 
our in house fabrication facility and the facilities of certain of our significant customers and third party wafer suppliers are located in areas that are susceptible to earthquakes 
damage caused by earthquakes may result in shortages in water or electricity or transportation  which could limit the production capacity of our wafer facility and or the ability of certain of our subcontractors to provide needed products 
any reduction in production capacity or the ability to obtain fully processed semiconductor wafers could cause delays or shortages in our product supply  which would negatively impact our business 
if our facilities or the facilities of our customers are damaged by future earthquakes  it could have a materially adverse effect on our business 
we rely on outside suppliers to assemble  test and ship product to our customers 
we rely on outside assembly houses to assemble  test and ship our product to end customers 
there can be no assurance that our third party suppliers will allocate sufficient capacity to us to meet our requirements 
any sudden reduction or elimination of a primary source could result in material delay in the shipment of our product and could have a material adverse affect on our business and operating results 
we have limited control over quality assurance  manufacturing yields and production costs 
we have in the past experienced yield issues and delays  especially with the introduction of new products 
we could experience delays or yield issues in the future due to the transfer of products from development to production  which could negatively impact our business and operating results 
we must comply with significant environmental regulations  which is difficult and expensive 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local governmental regulations related to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
although we believe that our activities conform to presently applicable environmental regulations  the failure to comply with present or future regulations could result in fines being imposed on us  suspension of production or a cessation of operations 
any failure by us to control the use of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous substances  or otherwise comply with environmental regulations  could subject us to significant future liabilities 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we have not violated laws or regulations in the past  which violations could result in remediation or other significant liabilities  or that past use or disposal of environmentally sensitive materials in conformity with then existing environmental laws and regulations will not result in remediation or other significant liabilities under current or future environmental laws or regulations 
it would be difficult for us to adjust our spending significantly if we experience any revenue shortfalls 
our future revenues are difficult to predict and at times in the past we have failed to achieve our revenue expectations 
our expense levels are based in part  on our expectations of future revenues  and expense levels are  to a large extent  fixed in the short term 
since the fourth quarter of  we have adjusted our spending levels as a result of decreased revenues and continue to focus on controlling costs 
we may  however  be unable to adjust spending in a timely manner to compensate for any unexpected revenue shortfall 
if revenue levels are below expectations for any reason our operating results will be negatively impacted 
due to the absence of substantial non cancelable backlog  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand  which are highly unpredictable and often fluctuate substantially 
in the future  if we believe that demand is increasing  our operating expenses for personnel  new product development and for inventory would correspondingly increase as needed in anticipation of increasing sales levels 
our operating results would be negatively impacted if increased sales were not achieved 
in addition  we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
we may have capital requirements to maintain and grow our business and we may not be able to secure adequate capital on acceptable terms 
in order to remain competitive  we must continue to make investments in our facilities and capital equipment 
we have obtained additional funding through the private placement of million shares of sipex common stock on april   which provided million to the company  net of placement agent fees and other costs of issuance  and through the private placement of a convertible secured note and related warrant on september   which provided approximately 
table of contents million to the company  net of costs of issuance 
we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing from time to time and cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
because our stock is trading near historically low levels  any future equity or convertible debt financing may result in substantial dilution to existing stockholders  depending on the price at which the equity is sold or the debt is converted and the extent of our needs 
our ability to raise funds may be adversely affected by a number of factors relating to sipex  as well as factors beyond our control  such as capital market uncertainty and general economic conditions 
our stock price has been volatile and could continue to remain volatile 
the trading price of our common stock is subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarter to quarter variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  general conditions in the semiconductor manufacturing and electronic markets  changes in earnings estimates by analysts  or other events or factors 
in addition  the public stock markets have experienced extreme price and trading volume volatility in recent months 
in the quarter ended december   our stock closing price ranged from a high of to a low of 
in the fourth quarter ending december   our stock closing price ranged from a high of to a low of 
this volatility has significantly affected the market prices of securities of many technology companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
we could face securities litigation if our stock price remains highly volatile 
in the past  securities class action litigation has often followed periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities 
in the past  we were named in two virtually identical securities class action lawsuits 
the complaints and unspecified damages alleged  among other things  that our financial statements for the second and third quarters of fiscal year contained incorrect statements 
on april   the us district court dismissed both suits with prejudice 
the litigation process is inherently uncertain and unpredictable  however  and there can be no guarantee that we will not become subject to such suits in the future 
moreover  there can be no guarantee that if we do become subject to such suits  that the ultimate outcome will be similar to the cases noted above 
any litigation could result in substantial costs and a diversion of management s attention and resources  which could negatively impact our business 
changes in laws  regulations and financial accounting standards may affect our reported results of operations 
the recently enacted sarbanes oxley act of and related regulations may result in changes in accounting standards or accepted practices within our industry 
new pronouncements and varying interpretations of pronouncements have occurred in the past and are likely to occur in the future as a result of recent congressional and regulatory actions 
new laws  regulations  and accounting standards  as well as the questioning of  or changes to  currently accepted accounting practices in the technology industry may adversely affect our reported financial results  which could have an adverse effect on our stock price 
proposals have been made concerning the expensing of stock options which could result in rules or laws that may adversely affect our reported financial results and have an adverse effect on our stock price
