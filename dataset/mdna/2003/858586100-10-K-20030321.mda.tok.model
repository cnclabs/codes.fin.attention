critical accounting policies estimates we prepare our financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america generally accepted accounting principles 
preparing our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
critical areas where estimates are required are noted below environmental liabilities it is the company s accounting policy to record environmental liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
reserves for doubtful accounts accounts receivable are reported net of reserves for doubtful accounts 
the company determines the reserve requirement based upon the estimated collectibility of specific delinquent accounts  the company s historical loss experience and the level of non delinquent accounts receivable 
reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventories the company provides reserves for obsolete and slow moving inventory items 
the reserve requirement is estimated based upon a review of specific inventory items that are identified as slow moving and consideration of potential salvage value and disposal costs 
because the foregoing liabilities and reserves are recorded based on estimates  actual amounts could differ from these estimates 
revenue recognition revenue is recognized upon shipment of goods to customers  at which time title and risk of loss has passed to the customer 
the company records shipping and handling billed to a customer in a sales transaction as revenue 
costs incurred for shipping and handling are recorded in cost of sales 
volume discounts due customers are recognized as earned and reported as reductions of revenue in the statement of income 
deferred compensation the company maintains deferred compensation plans 
these plans allow management to defer receipt of their bonuses and directors to defer receipt of director fees until retirement or departure from the company 
the plans allow the participant to choose to invest in either stepan common stock or a limited variety of mutual funds 
these assets are owned by the company and subject to the claims of general creditors of the company 
these plans are accounted for under the requirements of the consensus reached by the emerging issues task force eitf of the financial accounting standards board fasb in issue no 
 accounting for deferred compensation arrangements where amounts earned are held in a rabbi trust and invested 
a description of the company s deferred compensation accounting policy follows the deferred compensation liability to the participants who elect deferral is recorded when the underlying compensation is earned  and recorded as expense 
the purchase of stepan common shares for the plans is recorded as a regular treasury stock purchase 
the purchase of mutual funds is recorded as other non current assets 
fluctuations in the value of these assets are recorded as adjustments for the deferred compensation liability and compensation costs included in administrative expense 
the dividends  interest and capital gains from the mutual fund assets are recorded as investment income  which is netted against interest expense in the other income caption of the consolidated statements of income 
unrealized gains and losses resulting from market fluctuations of the mutual funds are recorded as other comprehensive income or expense in stockholders equity 
intangible assets the company has intangible assets  which include patents  agreements not to compete  trademarks  customer lists and goodwill 
these assets are accounted for under the requirements of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the goodwill acquired as a result of a business combination is not being amortized 
instead  goodwill is tested for impairment by applying a fair value based test on an annual basis 
upon adoption of sfas no 
on january   our analysis reflected no impairment of goodwill 
the provisions of sfas no 
that apply to acquisitions made prior to june   were adopted on january  as a result the company stopped recognizing approximately million of goodwill amortization expense in also  sfas no 
establishes new accounting guidelines for intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives 
these assets are no longer subject to amortization  but must be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
as of december   the company does not have intangible assets with indefinite lives 
all intangible assets  other than goodwill  have finite useful lives and are being amortized in accordance with assigned useful lives

environmental and legal matters the company is subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations 
although the company s environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with these laws and regulations  future developments and increasingly stringent environmental regulation could require the company to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures 
the company will continue to invest in the equipment and facilities necessary to comply with existing and future regulations 
during  the company s expenditures for capital projects related to the environment were million

the company has been named by the government as a potentially responsible party at waste disposal sites where cleanup costs have been or may be incurred under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and similar state statutes 
in addition  damages are being claimed against the company in general liability actions for alleged personal injury or property damage in the case of some disposal and plant sites 
the company believes that it has made adequate provisions for the costs it may incur with respect to the sites 
it is the company s accounting policy to record liabilities when environmental assessments and or remedial efforts are probable and the cost or range of possible costs can be reasonably estimated 
when no amount within the range is a better estimate than any other amount  the minimum is accrued 
some of the factors on which the company bases its estimates include information provided by feasibility studies  potentially responsible party negotiations and the development of remedial action plans 
because reported liabilities are recorded based on estimates  actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
after partial remediation payments at certain sites  the company has estimated a range of possible environmental and legal losses from million to million at december   compared to million to million at december  at december  the company s reserve was million for legal and environmental matters compared to million at december  during  non capital expenditures related to legal and environmental matters approximated million compared to million expended in for certain sites  estimates cannot be made of the total costs of compliance or the company s share of such costs  accordingly  the company is unable to predict the effect thereof on future results of operations 
in the event of one or more adverse determinations in any annual or interim period  the impact on results of operations for those periods could be material 
however  based upon the company s present belief as to its relative involvement at these sites  other viable entities responsibilities for cleanup and the extended period over which any costs would be incurred  the company believes that these matters will not have a material effect on the company s financial position 
certain of these matters are discussed in item  legal proceedings  in the form k annual report and in other filings of the company with the securities and exchange commission  which are available upon request from the company 
see also note  contingencies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a summary of the environmental proceedings related to certain environmental sites

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange risk because the company operates in the global marketplace  its cash flows and operating results are exposed to foreign currency fluctuations 
the company manufactures and sells products in many foreign locations and  therefore  believes its currency exchange risk is well diversified 
except as noted below  substantially all the company s foreign subsidiaries financial instruments are denominated in their respective functional currencies 
as such  exposure to exchange rate risk on foreign currency financial instruments is not considered significant 
gains or losses on unhedged foreign currency transactions are included in income 
the company and its foreign subsidiaries periodically use short term forward exchange contracts to limit the exposure of certain foreign currency transactions and balances to fluctuating exchange rates 
as of december   the company had no outstanding forward exchange contracts 
from time to time  the company extends us dollar denominated loans or extended trade receivables to its foreign subsidiaries 
gains or losses on such transactions are recorded in income 
as of december   the company had an outstanding loan balance of million due from its european subsidiary and trade receivables of million due from its brazilian subsidiary 
a hypothetical fluctuation of percent in the exchange rate of the euro or the brazilian real would result in a gain or loss of million or million  respectively 
interest rates the company s debt was composed of fixed rate and variable rate borrowings totaling million and million  respectively  as of december  for  it is projected that interest on variable rate borrowings will comprise about percent of the company s total interest expense 
a percent increase or decrease to short term interest rates would be immaterial to the company s operating results or cash flow 
the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt  including current maturities  was estimated to be million as of december   which was approximately million above the carrying value 
market risk was estimated as the potential increase to the fair value that would result from a hypothetical percent decrease in the company s weighted average long term borrowing rates at december   or million 
such a rate decrease would be immaterial to future operating results or cash flow 
commodity price risk certain raw materials used in the manufacture of the company s products are subject to price volatility caused by weather  petroleum prices and other unpredictable factors 
in many cases  the company has the ability to pass on raw material price increases to customers 
therefore  commodity financial instruments are generally not used for raw material purchases 
periodically  firm purchase commitments are entered into which fix the price of a specific commodity that will be delivered at a future time 
such commitments usually cover only a portion of the company s anticipated requirements 
commodity future and forward contracts are used to a limited extent  most often to aid in managing the company s utility costs 
as of december   unrealized gains and losses related to such contracts were not material 
a hypothetical percent fluctuation in the price of commodities covered by firm commitments and forward contracts would have an immaterial effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flow
