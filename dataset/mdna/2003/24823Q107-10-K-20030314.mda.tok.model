item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
current cancer therapies cancer is characterized by abnormal cells that proliferate uncontrollably and metastasize  or spread  throughout the body  producing deposits of tumor cells  called metastases 
these proliferating cells form masses called tumors 
as the tumors grow  they cause tissue and organ failure and ultimately death 
to be effective  therapy must eliminate or control the growth of the cancer both at its site of origin and at sites of metastases 
metastatic disease is often responsible for the relapse and ultimate death of patients with cancer 
current treatments for cancer include surgery  radiation  hormone therapy and chemotherapy 
surgery and radiation therapy treat cancer at its origin  but are limited because certain tissues cannot be removed surgically and or do not tolerate radiation 
moreover  cancers frequently spread prior to detection  and surgery and radiation cannot control all metastases 
chemotherapy and hormone therapy are frequently used to treat tumor metastases 
however  these therapies can cause severe side effects  including damage to normal tissue 
additionally  chemotherapy and hormone therapy may shrink tumors  but rarely eliminate them completely 
treatments known as immunotherapy stimulate the body s natural mechanism for fighting disease and may overcome many of the limitations of current cancer therapies 
immunotherapy may be particularly useful for the treatment of residual disease 
the immune system antigens 
the immune system  the body s natural defense against disease  is composed of a variety of specialized cells 
these cells recognize specific chemical structures  called antigens  that are found on disease 
table of contents causing agents  including tumors 
antigens trigger an immune response  which results in the eventual removal of antigen from the body 
cells of the immune system 
a specialized class of immune system cells  called antigen presenting cells  start the immune response 
the most potent antigen presenting cells are known as dendritic cells  which take up antigen from their surroundings and process the antigen into fragments that are recognized by specific classes of immune cells  called lymphocytes 
during this antigen processing  dendritic cells mature  enabling them to present the processed antigen to lymphocytes 
there are two main categories of lymphocytes b lymphocytes  or b cells  and t lymphocytes  or t cells 
each category of lymphocytes has a different role in the immune response 
t cells combat disease by killing antigen bearing cells directly 
in this way  t cells eliminate cancers and virally infected tissue 
t cell immunity is also known as cell mediated immunity and commonly is thought to be a key defense against tumors and cells chronically infected by viruses 
in contrast  activation of b cells leads to the production of specific antibodies 
the antibodies are secreted by b cells and bind to antigen found on pathogens or tumor cells resulting in their destruction 
tumor antigens 
the immune system recognizes and generates a strong response to hundreds of thousands of different antigens introduced from the environment 
tumors  however  frequently display antigens that are also found on normal cells 
thus  the immune system may not distinguish between tumors and normal cells and  therefore  may be unable to mount a strong anti cancer response 
tumors may also actively prevent antigen presenting cells from becoming mature  thereby preventing full activation of the immune system 
thus  we believe one key to directing the immune system to fight cancers is to modify  or engineer  tumor antigens so that they are recognized by the immune system and to manipulate antigen presenting cells to stimulate a vigorous cell mediated immunity 
monoclonal antibodies 
naturally occurring antibodies are proteins that are an essential component of the human immune system 
they are produced in response to the presence of foreign antigens in the body and are extremely specific 
each antibody binds to and attacks one particular type of antigen expressed on a cell  interfering with that cell s activity or causing cell death 
monoclonal antibodies are manufactured antibodies that share characteristics of naturally occurring antibodies 
they may be created to recognize a specific antigen present on tumor cells  but not on healthy cells  and to bind to that antigen and cause the death of the tumor cell 
because each monoclonal antibody targets only cells expressing a specific antigen  healthy cells may be unaffected  and many of the harsh side effects of conventional cancer therapies avoided 
monoclonal antibodies may be used alone or coupled with drugs or radioisotopes in combination therapies that attack cancer cells in several ways 
our therapeutic cancer vaccine approach we combine our experience in antigen identification  antigen engineering and antigen presenting cell processing to produce therapeutic cancer vaccines 
our ability to both manipulate antigen presenting cells and engineer antigens allows us to develop vaccines that are designed to generate a cell mediated immune response 
we have vaccines in development for many common cancers 
our approach to therapeutic cancer vaccines is to identify antigens on cancer cells that are suitable targets for cancer therapy  create proprietary  genetically engineered antigen delivery cassettes that will be optimally processed by antigen presenting cells  isolate and activate antigen presenting cells using proprietary methods  and create cancer vaccines that combine antigen presenting cells and engineered antigens to trigger a cell mediated immune response to destroy tumors 
antigen identification our objective is to identify antigens associated with as broad a population of cancers as possible 
we obtain antigens from several sources our internal discovery programs  public databases of genetic information and 
table of contents licenses from third parties 
our internal antigen discovery programs begin by identifying novel antigens expressed in specific tissues or in malignant cells 
we then evaluate the expression of these antigens in normal versus diseased tissue 
we consider the antigens that we find localized in diseased tissue as candidates for antigen engineering 
likewise  we also consider antigens from external sources that meet these criteria 
our lead product candidate  provenge  targets the prostate cancer antigen  prostatic acid phosphatase  or pap 
the antigen target for apc  our therapeutic vaccine in phase i clinical trials for breast  ovarian and colon cancer  is her neu 
in  we were issued a patent on a gene designated trp p the protein expressed by this gene is found on multiple cancers 
we have also acquired through licenses  the opportunity to work with the tumor antigens designated carcinoembryonic antigen  or cea  carbonic anhydrase ix  or mn  and telomerase 
antigen engineering we engineer antigens to produce proprietary therapeutic vaccines for multiple cancers 
our antigen engineering is designed to trigger and maximize cell mediated immunity by augmenting the uptake and processing of the target antigen by antigen presenting cells 
we can affect the quality and quantity of the immune response that is generated by adding  deleting or modifying selected sequences of the antigen gene  together with inserting the modified antigen into our antigen delivery cassette 
our antigen delivery cassette is a protein that enhances antigen binding and entry into antigen presenting cells 
the antigen delivery cassette targets each engineered antigen to a receptor on antigen presenting cells and provides a common key to unlock the potential of these cells to process antigen 
the antigen presenting cell binding region is common to all of our antigen delivery cassettes and has the capability to recognize the antigen presenting cell and bind the cassette to the antigen presenting cell surface 
binding stimulates the antigen presenting cell to engulf the cassette 
the antigen presenting cells process antigen along pathways that stimulate cell mediated immunity 
the antigen region of the antigen delivery cassette thus gains access to processing by the antigen presenting cell that would otherwise be denied to non engineered antigen 
we believe this process results in a potent cell mediated immune response 
our antigen delivery cassette technology also provides us with a foundation on which new proprietary antigens are built 
antigen presenting cell processing and vaccine production our vaccine manufacturing process incorporates two elements the antigen delivery cassette and antigen presenting cells 
to obtain antigen presenting cells  we first remove white blood cells from a patient s blood through a standard blood collection process called leukapheresis 
antigen presenting cells are then separated from other white blood cells using our proprietary cell separation technology 
we perform our process outside of the body  away from the immunosuppressive environment of tumor cells 
we believe that this allows the antigen presenting cells to become fully mature and activated  leading to a more robust immune response 
the antigen presenting cells are incubated with the required concentration of antigen delivery cassette under controlled conditions 
after about hours  the antigen presenting cells are ready to be used as a vaccine 
we subject each vaccine to quality control testing  including identity  purity  potency  and safety testing  including sterility 
our process requires less than three days from white blood cell collection to vaccine administration 
vaccine delivery a vaccine dose is delivered as an intravenous infusion lasting about minutes given as an outpatient procedure 
our clinical trials indicate that maximum stimulation requires three infusions given at two week intervals 
patients in our trials typically complete a course of therapy in one month 

table of contents preclinical product candidates we have therapeutic monoclonal antibodies for the treatment of cancer and autoimmune diseases in preclinical development 
dn  our monoclonal antibody against hla dr positive malignancies  is in preclinical development for the treatment of leukemias and lymphomas such as non hodgkin s lymphoma  hodgkin s lymphoma  and b cell leukemia 
in preclinical studies to date  dn has been shown to induce cell death in cancer cells expressing hla dr  but has no effect on normal cells and does not suppress immune response 
our monoclonal antibody  dn  is in preclinical development for the treatment of autoimmune diseases  including rheumatoid arthritis 
in collaboration with genentech  inc  we are working to develop a monoclonal antibody to trp p  a gene discovered in our internal discovery program  that is a potential treatment for soft tissue malignancies such as prostate  breast and colon cancer 
the functional characteristics of trp p also make it a candidate for small molecule therapies 
small molecules are a diverse group of natural and synthetic substances that generally have a low molecular weight 
they are either isolated from natural sources such as plants  fungi or microbes or they are synthesized by organic chemistry 
most conventional pharmaceuticals  such as aspirin  penicillin and chemotherapeutics  are small molecules 
small molecules have many different uses  modes of action  and side effect profiles because there are many different classes of small molecules 
ion channels  like trp p that transport calcium through the cell membrane are one of many examples of molecular targets for manipulation by small molecules 
under our agreements with genentech  we are primarily responsible for preclinical development of a small molecule targeting trp p products the following table summarizes the target indications and status of our products and product candidates in development

phase ii evaluation of safety and efficacy 
phase iii definitive evaluation of safety and efficacy 
product candidates in clinical trials provenge for prostate cancer prostate cancer is the most common solid tumor malignancy in men in the united states with over one million currently diagnosed with this disease 
the american cancer society estimates that  in the united states  prostate cancer was diagnosed in approximately  men and that approximately  men died of the disease in the antigen component of provenge is derived from the gene encoding a marker for prostate cancer  prostatic acid phosphatase  which is found in approximately of prostate cancers 
we have subjected prostatic acid phosphatase to our antigen engineering process and created a proprietary antigen delivery cassette 
we initiated two double blind  placebo controlled phase iii clinical trials  d and d  designed to demonstrate that provenge is safe and effective for treating androgen independent prostate cancer  or aipc 
androgen independent means that tumor growth is no longer regulated by androgens  or male hormones  and that the disease has progressed to an advanced stage 
men with prostate cancer who are hormone resistant are considered androgen independent 
the results from our first phase iii trial of provenge  d  were announced in august the results did not meet the primary endpoint of the study  a pre specified delay in the time to objective disease progression versus placebo in the overall study population 
however  the results demonstrated significant benefit from provenge treatment for men with a gleason score of or less 
for these patients  the probability of remaining progression free while on the study was over two times higher than for patients treated with placebo 
in patients with a gleason score of or less  the placebo group had a median time to disease progression of weeks  
table of contents compared to weeks in the provenge treated group  with a highly significant p value of and a treatment effect of 
in addition  the patients receiving provenge  whose disease had not progressed six months after randomization  had a greater than eight fold advantage in progression free survival compared to patients who received placebo of provenge patients versus of placebo patients 
no apparent benefit was observed among patients with gleason scores of or higher 
a gleason score is the most commonly used prostate cancer scoring system and is considered one of the most important prognostic indicators for prostate cancer 
high gleason scores or above are indicative of aggressive cancers 
in the androgen independent population  approximately of the patients have a gleason score of or less 
in december  we announced additional results from d indicating that  in addition to delaying the time to progression of disease  provenge treatment delayed the onset of disease related pain in patients with a gleason score of or less 
delay in the onset of disease related pain was the secondary endpoint of d  which enrolled only patients who did not have cancer related pain at the time of entry into the study 
in patients with a gleason score of or less  those receiving treatment with provenge remained pain free significantly longer than those receiving placebo p 
for patients with a gleason score of or less treated with provenge  the probability of remaining free of cancer related pain while on the study was over two and one half times higher than for patients treated with placebo 
no apparent benefit in the pain endpoint was observed among patients with gleason scores of or higher 
in light of the results from d  we met with the us food and drug administration  or fda  to discuss our second phase iii clinical trial for provenge  d based upon those discussions  the protocol for d has been revised to enroll only androgen independent prostate cancer patients with a gleason score of or less whose cancer has spread but who otherwise are without symptoms 
our plan for d  as amended  is that it will serve as the pivotal trial for seeking marketing approval for provenge 
we are currently engaged in discussions with pharmaceutical companies regarding potential collaboration arrangements for the commercialization of provenge 
we are also currently conducting a phase iii clinical trial p of provenge to evaluate its safety and effectiveness in treating men with early stage  androgen dependent prostate cancer 
men with prostate cancer who are hormone sensitive are considered androgen dependent 
mylovenge for b cell malignancies multiple myeloma and amyloidosis in  approximately  people were diagnosed with multiple myeloma  a cancer of the blood  and over  individuals died from this disease in the united states 
it accounts for approximately of cancers of the blood 
amyloidosis is a disease related to multiple myeloma  afflicting approximately  individuals in the united states annually  and amyloidosis is fatal in most cases 
mylovenge has received orphan drug designation from the fda for the treatment of multiple myeloma 
we are conducting phase ii clinical trials for mylovenge  our therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of multiple myeloma and amyloidosis 
we expect to complete these trials in the first half of at that time  we will be able to determine the future development of mylovenge in light of the results of our phase ii trials  the prospects for potential products being developed by competitors  and other relevant factors 
apc for treatment of breast  ovarian and colon cancers apc is our vaccine against tumors that have increased levels of a protein called her neu 
increased levels of this protein are found in approximately of metastatic breast  ovarian  and colon cancers 
we have identified portions of the her neu molecule that stimulate a potent cell mediated immune response in animal models when engineered into our antigen delivery cassette 
we are conducting phase i trials to evaluate apc for the treatment of patients with tumors that over express her neu 
the trials examine different doses  schedules and formulations of apc for safety and 
table of contents ability to stimulate immunity 
preliminary results from one of our phase i studies for apc were announced in december the initial results indicate that apc appears to be generally well tolerated  stimulates immunity  and is showing signs of clinical benefit in patients with her positive breast cancer that has spread 
in this phase i study  women received treatment with apc of patients evaluated  patients had stable disease  and one patient had a partial response with a more than reduction in tumor size 
an immune response was detected in all of the patients evaluated 
side effects were minor  consisting primarily of fever and chills following vaccine infusion 
product candidates in research and development vaccine targets trp p the trp p gene  and the protein encoded by this gene  is present on of prostate cancers and approximately of breast cancers  of colorectal cancers and of lung cancers 
trp p is the first gene generated from our internal antigen discovery program 
a patent on the gene encoding trp p was issued to us in we plan to incorporate the trp p antigen into our vaccine technology 
ny eso ny eso is a protein that is present on many cancers  including melanoma  breast  prostate  lung  ovarian uterine and bladder cancers 
we licensed the ny eso antigen from the ludwig cancer institute  where scientists performed a series of preclinical studies that demonstrated that ny eso is an appropriate immunotherapy target 
we engineered the ny eso antigen into our antigen delivery cassette 
carcinoembryonic antigen cea the carcinoembryonic antigen  or cea  is present on of lung cancers  virtually all cases of colon cancers and approximately of breast cancers 
we licensed the cea antigen from bayer corporation  business group diagnostics 
we plan to incorporate the cea antigen into our vaccine technology 
carbonic anhydrase ix antigen mn mn antigen is a protein also known as the carbonic anhydrase ix antigen 
it is present on approximately of cervical and colon cancers and of renal cancers 
we licensed the mn antigen from bayer corporation  business group diagnostics 
we plan to incorporate the mn antigen into our vaccine technology 
telomerase the human telomerase antigen  or htert  is present on approximately of tumor samples 
we licensed the htert antigen from geron corporation and plan to incorporate it into our vaccine technology 
additional vaccine products we believe that our vaccine technologies have additional potential applications that  over time  we may pursue in the fields of autoimmune diseases  allergies and infectious diseases 
monoclonal antibodies trp p trp p  the protein encoded by the trp p gene  is a voltage gated calcium ion channel 
it displays numerous characteristics that make it an attractive target for immunotherapy  as well as for small molecule drug therapy 
in 
table of contents normal human tissues  trp p is expressed predominantly in the prostate and is over expressed in hyperplastic prostate 
in cancerous tissues  trp p is expressed in cancers of the prostate  colon  lung and breast 
the unique molecular characteristics of trp p make it an attractive candidate as a therapeutic target for monoclonal antibodies  cancer vaccines and small molecules 
in  we entered into a collaboration agreement with genentech to discover and develop products targeting trp p dn antibody for treatment of cancer dn is our monoclonal antibody that targets a unique antigen called hla dr present on normal and malignant blood cells and causes the death of only malignant cells 
the target for dn is present on numerous blood borne tumors  such as hodgkin s lymphoma  non hodgkin s lymphoma  and b cell leukemias 
current treatments for these cancers include chemotherapy  radiation  and high dose chemotherapy with stem cell transplantation  all of which are highly toxic 
more recently  a monoclonal antibody  rituximab  has been approved for use in some of these patients 
it is directed to a different antigen than the antigen to which dn binds 
preclinical studies suggest that dn can kill human cancer cells without apparent toxicity or immune suppressive side effects 
furthermore  these preclinical studies suggest that cancer cells may not develop resistance to this treatment over time 
dn antibody for treatment of autoimmune disease dn is our monoclonal antibody that suppresses activities of the immune system 
autoimmune diseases  such as rheumatoid arthritis  systemic lupus erythematosus  multiple sclerosis  myasthenia gravis and pemphigus vulgaris  result from unwanted activities of the immune system 
current therapies include non specific immune suppression by corticosteroids  methotrexate and other drugs 
although these treatments may reduce tissue damage in some patients  they are not curative 
dn is specific for a well known target for immunosuppression  hla dr 
previously  other companies have attempted to develop drugs that target hla dr 
although those drugs usually suppressed immune response  they failed in preclinical studies due to unacceptable toxicity 
we have observed that suppression of immune response and toxicity are mediated by two separate parts of the antibody molecule 
we are developing dn to take advantage of this observation 
dn has shown encouraging immunosuppressive abilities in our preclinical studies without producing unacceptable levels of toxicity 
cell separation products we developed proprietary cell separation technology that can be tailored for specific cell types 
this technology consists of two components specially engineered separation and wash containers and solutions called buoyant density solutions 
we prepare our buoyant density solutions to match the buoyant density of a particular cell type 
by matching buoyant densities in this manner  we are able to control whether or not a specific cell type floats or sinks in the solution 
this allows us to isolate the desired cells easily  rapidly and without the need for the biological reagents used in conventional cell separation techniques 
in  we received a marketing authorization in the united states on a family of our solutions and separation devices 
in  we obtained pre marketing approval  or a pma  from the fda for our dacs sc kit 
we use our cell separation technology to isolate antigen presenting cells for our cancer vaccines

we intend to continue using our scientific expertise to pursue and patent new developments with respect to uses  compositions and factors to enhance our position in the field of cancer 
patents  if issued  may be challenged  invalidated or circumvented 
thus  any patent that we own or license from third parties may not provide adequate protection against competitors 
our pending patent applications  those we may file in the future  or those we may license from third parties may not result in issued patents 
also  patents may not provide us with adequate proprietary protection or advantages against competitors with similar or competing technologies 
for example  we are aware of others that have had patents issued to them in the antigen presenting cell field relating to methods to isolate  culture or activate antigen presenting cells and relating to the treatment with antigens of cancers such as prostate cancer 
as a result of potential conflicts with the proprietary rights of others  we may in the future have to prove we are not infringing the patent rights of others or be required to obtain a license to the patent 
we do not know whether such a license would be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we also rely on trade secrets and unpatentable know how that we seek to protect  in part  by confidentiality agreements 
our policy is to require our officers  employees  consultants  contractors  manufacturers  outside scientific collaborators and sponsored researchers and other advisors to execute confidentiality agreements 
these agreements provide that all confidential information developed or made known to the individual during the course of the individual s relationship with us be kept confidential and not disclosed to third parties except in specific limited circumstances 
we also require signed confidentiality or material transfer agreements from companies that are to receive our confidential data 
in the case of employees  consultants and contractors  confidentiality agreements with them generally provide that all inventions conceived by the individual while rendering services to us shall be assigned to us as our exclusive property 
however  it is possible that these parties may breach those agreements  and we may not have adequate remedies for any breach 
it is also possible that our trade secrets or unpatentable know how will otherwise become known or be independently developed by competitors 
competition the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industries are characterized by rapidly advancing technologies  intense competition and a strong emphasis on proprietary products 
many entities  including pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies  academic institutions and other research organizations are actively engaged in the discovery  research and development of products that could compete directly with our products under 
table of contents development 
we understand that companies  including avi biopharma  inc  cell genesys  inc  and therion biologics corporation  may be developing cancer vaccines for the united states market that could potentially compete with provenge  if provenge is successfully developed 
these competitors may succeed in developing and marketing cancer vaccines that are more effective than or marketed before provenge 
other products such as chemotherapeutics  antigen compounds  angiogenesis inhibitors and gene therapies are also under development and could potentially compete with provenge or other products we may develop 
many companies  including major pharmaceutical companies  are also developing therapies that may compete with our other potential products in the fields of cancer and autoimmune diseases 
many of the companies developing cancer vaccines and other treatments have significantly greater financial resources and expertise in research and development  manufacturing  preclinical testing  conducting clinical trials  obtaining regulatory approvals and marketing 
others have partnered with large established companies to obtain access to these resources 
smaller companies may also prove to be significant competitors  particularly through the establishment of collaborative arrangements with large  established companies 
our ability to commercialize our potential products and compete effectively will depend  in large part  on our ability to advance provenge and our other vaccine products through clinical trials and through the fda approval process  the perception by physicians and other members of the health care community of the safety  efficacy and benefits of provenge or our other products compared to those of competing products or therapies  the effectiveness of our sales and marketing efforts and those of our marketing partners  the willingness of physicians to adopt a new treatment regimen represented by our antigen presenting cell technology  our ability to meet demand for our products  our ability to secure reimbursement for provenge and the price of that product relative to competing products  our ability to develop a commercial scale infrastructure either on our own or with a collaborator  and our ability to meet all necessary regulatory requirements 
competition among products approved for sale will be based  among other things  upon efficacy  reliability  product safety  price and patent position 
our competitiveness will also depend on our ability to advance our technologies  license additional technology  maintain a proprietary position in our technologies and products  obtain required government and other public and private approvals on a timely basis  attract and retain key personnel and enter into corporate relationships that enable us and our collaborators to develop effective products that can be manufactured cost effectively and marketed successfully

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview dendreon corporation is dedicated to the discovery and development of novel products for the treatment of diseases through its innovative manipulation of the immune system 
dendreon s product pipeline is focused on cancer  and includes therapeutic vaccines  monoclonal antibodies and small molecule product candidates 

table of contents the product candidates most advanced in development are therapeutic vaccines that are designed to stimulate a patient s immunity for the treatment of cancer 
provenge  our therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of prostate cancer  has advanced to phase iii clinical trials  the final stage of human testing before seeking marketing approval 
we are conducting phase ii clinical trials for mylovenge  our therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of multiple myeloma and received an orphan drug designation for this product candidate in multiple myeloma 
in september  we announced that our collaborator in asia  the pharmaceutical division of kirin brewery co 
ltd  had begun a clinical trial of mylovenge in japan 
we received a million payment from kirin in august for this milestone 
we expect to complete these trials in the first half of at that time  we will be able to determine the future development of mylovenge in light of the results of our phase ii trials  the prospects for potential products being developed by competitors  and other relevant factors 
we are also conducting phase i clinical trials for apc  our therapeutic vaccine for the treatment of breast  ovarian and colon cancers 
preliminary results from one of our phase i studies for apc were announced in december in august  we entered into an agreement with genentech  inc to collaborate in the preclinical research  clinical development and commercialization of monoclonal antibodies  and potentially small molecules and other products derived from our trp p gene platform 
the companies will be jointly responsible for conducting pre clinical and clinical work 
pursuant to our agreement  genentech paid us a million up front fee and purchased million of our common stock in august the agreement also provides for milestone and other payments for the resulting development of trp p products 
over the last year  we have taken steps to create greater efficiency and cost effectiveness in our operations and to realign our operations to provide additional support for the development of provenge 
these steps included the sale of our mountain view  california cell processing facility and the transfer of employees to progenitor cell therapy  llp and a reorganization of our staff that has resulted in a reduction in headcount in our seattle  washington facility 
the combination of these steps reduced our total headcount from as of december   to as of december  as a result of these efforts  we anticipate short term cost savings 
however  these cost savings may be offset in the future by increased costs associated with the development of provenge and continued progress with our other clinical and pre clinical programs 
we have hired and plan to continue to hire new employees to develop provenge and meet the needs of our other clinical and pre clinical programs 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
we have incurred net losses as a result of research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations  clinical trial expenses and marketing expenses 
we anticipate incurring net losses over at least the next several years as we continue our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  develop our technology  expand our operations and develop systems that support commercialization 
subsequent event acquisition of corvas international  inc 
on february   we  seahawk acquisition  inc  a wholly owned subsidiary formed by us  charger project llc  also a wholly owned subsidiary formed by us  and corvas international  inc  or corvas  entered into an agreement by which we agreed to acquire corvas 
pursuant to our agreement  seahawk acquisition will merge into corvas  with corvas surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
immediately thereafter  corvas will merge into charger project  with charger project surviving as a wholly owned subsidiary of ours 
the completion of the acquisition is subject to several conditions  including the approval of the acquisition by a 
table of contents majority of the stockholders of corvas and the approval of the issuance of our common stock in the acquisition by a majority of our common stock present or represented at a meeting of our stockholders to approve such issuance 
in connection with the acquisition  each outstanding share of corvas common stock will be converted into the right to receive of a share of our common stock 
we will assume all options outstanding under corvas existing stock option plans  and corvas stock options will be exercisable for our common stock subject to certain adjustments to the exercise price and number of shares issuable upon exercise of those options 
the transaction is expected to close in the first half of unless otherwise indicated  the discussion in this document relates to us as a stand alone entity and does not reflect the impact of the proposed acquisition of corvas 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments in certain circumstances that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgments of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  investments  income taxes  financing operations  long term service contracts  and other contingencies 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
revenue recognition revenue has been derived from our collaborative research and development agreements and from grant awards 
we expect to continue to derive revenue from our collaborative research and development agreements in future years 
non refundable  up front payments received in connection with collaborative research and development agreements are deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the relevant periods specified in the agreement  generally the research term 
when the research term is not specified in the agreement and instead the agreement specifies the completion or attainment of a particular development goal  we estimate and recognize the non refundable upfront payment over the time period required to achieve that goal considering experience with similar projects  level of effort and stage of development 
we revise our estimates as additional information becomes available 
revenue related to collaborative research with our corporate collaborators is recognized when research services are performed over the related funding periods for each agreement 
under these agreements  we are required to perform research and development activities as agreed or specified in each agreement 
the payments received under research collaboration agreements are not refundable if the research effort is not successful 
payments received in advance of the services provided are deferred and recognized as revenue over the future performance periods 
milestone payments are recognized based upon the achievement of the specified milestone and as defined in the agreements 
revenue from product supply agreements is recorded when the product is shipped and all obligations under the agreements are met 
as of december   we had deferred revenues of approximately million

results of operations years ended december   and revenue 
total revenue was million in  million in and million in collaborative and license revenue represented million  million and million of total revenue in  and  respectively 
grant revenue was in   in and  in  respectively 
the year over year increases in collaborative and license revenue were primarily due to payments received under our agreements with johnson johnson pharmaceutical research and development  llc  or j j prd  kirin and genentech 
the reduction in grant revenue from to  and to was due to the completion of an agreement with a university 
in  we expect lower collaborative and license revenue due to the expiration of the j j prd agreement on december in august  we entered into an agreement with genentech  inc to collaborate in the preclinical research  clinical development  and commercialization of monoclonal antibody and potentially other products derived from our trp p gene platform 
we will be jointly responsible with genentech for conducting preclinical and clinical work 
genentech will fund a majority of these expenses for products that reach phase iii clinical 
table of contents trials 
genentech will also be responsible for all manufacturing of resulting products 
the agreement provides for profit sharing and commercialization in the united states 
we received a non refundable up front fee of million upon signing the agreement 
this payment has been deferred and is being recognized on a straight line basis over the estimated research term of years 
under the term of the agreement  genentech made a million equity investment in the company s common stock in august genentech will make other option and milestone payments to us upon achievement of product development goals 
in august  we entered into a memorandum agreement modifying our agreements with kirin 
pursuant to the terms contained in the memorandum  kirin paid us million  and agreed to make an additional milestone payment upon commencement of kirin s first clinical trial of mylovenge  to compensate us for supplies of the antigen used in provenge and for separation devices  and to reimburse us for certain expenses relating to specified services provided for kirin s regulatory  clinical  and manufacturing activities relating to provenge and mylovenge 
the payment received in is being recognized as revenue over months  the term of the agreement 
in august  we received and recognized the million milestone payment from kirin upon the commencement of kirin s first clinical trial of mylovenge 
the modifications agreed to in august have been incorporated in amended and restated agreements  effective august  our agreement with kirin also provides for reimbursement by kirin for research and development expenses pursuant to a mutually agreed plan 
in  kirin reimbursed us million for such research and development expenses which has been recorded as revenue 
in  we anticipate reimbursement from kirin will be lower than levels 
in october  we entered into a collaborative development and license agreement with j j prd for the study of the parties respective products for the treatment of tumors expressing her neu 
the agreement reimbursed us for research and development expenses based on a mutually agreed research plan 
in  we were reimbursed million by j j prd for these expenses 
the agreement with j j prd expired on december  research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease in was mainly due to reduced clinical manufacturing and clinical trial costs during the partial clinical hold of d  our second phase iii clinical trial of provenge 
the million increase in over research and development expenses of million in  was due to increased product development expenses  including fees paid to third parties conducting clinical trials  increased personnel related expenses  facilities and depreciation expenses and supplies 
our research and development related activities can be divided into two areas research and pre clinical programs  and clinical programs 
research and development costs by project are not tracked on an actual cost basis  but rather are derived by the allocation of third party costs  personnel related costs and other overheads to a project based on human resource time incurred in each project 
research and preclinical projects primarily represent the costs associated with our product pipeline generating activities  including trp p  dn  dn and apcny 
the cost of clinical trial programs represents the advancement of the pipeline into product candidates 
it is not possible to estimate the time to completion of the clinical trials and their associated total costs  as this is dependent on the outcome of each trial event 
we estimate the cost of the two areas as follows in millions research and pre clinical programs clinical programs total research and development 
table of contents we anticipate an increase in total research and development expense in over clinical costs may grow at a faster rate compared to research and pre clinical expenses as we enroll patients into our amended phase iii provenge trial d 
in october  dendreon licensed rights to htert from geron 
we paid a license fee at inception of  shares of our common stock valued at  and we paid geron a second license fee in cash of  in october  the first anniversary of the agreement 
in addition  we are obligated to make certain milestone payments to geron 
the first milestone payment is due upon the submission of the first investigational new drug application  or ind  for a product incorporating htert and the second is due upon submission of the first biologics license application  or bla  to the fda 
three subsequent milestone payments are due upon submission of the second bla or equivalent  and upon the first and second product approvals  if any 
the agreement may be terminated by us without cause on sixty days written notice to geron 
in  there were no other milestone payments due 
in september  dendreon licensed rights to the cea and mn antigens from bayer corporation in two separate agreements 
we paid a license fee upon execution of each agreement  and made milestone payments of  on each of the products in april additional milestone payments will be due at the start of phase iii clinical trials of products incorporating cea or mn and the first approval for marketing authorization by the fda of such products  if successful 
royalties on sales of any products incorporating cea or mn will be due to bayer if and when commercial sales of such products commence 
in march  we contracted with diosynth rtp  inc to assist us in the scale up to commercial level production of the antigen used in the preparation of provenge 
at the inception of the agreement  we anticipated that a substantial part of the work and corresponding expense would be incurred in pursuant to procedures established in the agreement  we requested certain modifications to the program  to which diosynth agreed 
subsequently  and concurrently with our discussion with the fda regarding protocol amendment for d  we began discussion with diosynth to revise the scope of work for scale up to commercial level production 
these revisions are not yet finished 
we have the right to terminate the agreement with diosynth without cause on forty five days written notice to diosynth 
the agreement provides for a cancellation fee of of the unpaid balance of the total estimated budget for the program at the time the notice is given  approximately million as of december  the estimated budget will be revised as a consequence of revisions to the scope of work 
in light of the results from our first phase iii trial of provenge  d  and our planned protocol amendment for d  we have no present intention to exercise our right to cancel the agreement with diosynth 
general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in  from million in and million in in august  the company entered into an asset purchase agreement and cell processing agreement with progenitor cell therapy  llp  or pct  to outsource its mountain view  california cell processing operations 
under the terms of the agreement  pct pays installments of fees to the company and assumes operational  lease and personnel obligations for the cell processing facility 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in over was mainly due to the allocation of rent related to the unoccupied portion of the facility in mountain view  california  from research and development to general and administrative expenses 
the increase over was due to personnel related expenses and consulting fees associated with commercialization activities 
we currently anticipate general and administrative spending to increase slightly over levels 
marketing 
marketing expenses decreased to  in from million in this decrease was due to the lower advertising and medical education expenses as a result of the partial clinical hold on our phase iii clinical trial d 
marketing expenses increased to million in from  in this increase was mainly due to consulting expenses  primarily in connection with commercialization planning 
table of contents efforts 
marketing expenses in are expected to be higher than  as the company continues market research and promotional activities associated with provenge 
interest income 
interest income decreased to million in from million in the decrease was due to the decline in interest rates and a lower average cash balance 
interest income increased to million in from million in this increase was attributable to a higher average balance of cash  cash equivalents  short term and long term investments offset by a lower average interest rate yield on the investment portfolio 
interest income is expected to be lower in than due to the decline in interest rates and a lower average cash balance 
interest expense 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in and  in the period over period decrease was attributable to lower average balances of debt associated with capital lease obligations and as a result of the repayment of the transamerica note in february foreign income tax expense

net operating loss at december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million to offset future federal taxable income 
if not utilized  the tax net operating loss carryforwards will expire at various dates beginning in through we also had research and development tax credit carryforwards at december  of approximately million for federal income tax purposes 
utilization of the net operating losses and tax credits carryforwards may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in the ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and tax credits carryforwards before utilization 
stock based compensation expense stock based compensation expense consists of the amortization of deferred stock based compensation resulting from the grant of stock options at exercise prices subsequently deemed to be less than the fair value of the common stock on the grant date and the issuance of stock options to non employees in exchange of service 
we recorded total deferred stock based compensation of million in  and had outstanding deferred stock based compensation of million as of december  we initially recorded this amount as a component of stockholders equity and are amortizing it by charges to operations over the vesting period of the options using the graded vesting method 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  in  million in  and million in we expect amortization of deferred stock based compensation expense to be  in  and  in we recorded stock compensation expense of  and  in and  respectively  related to grants to non employees 
deemed dividend upon issuance of convertible preferred stock we recorded a deemed dividend of million in for the issuance of series e convertible preferred stock issued prior to the company s initial public offering 
the incremental fair value determined on the date of issuance for each closing of series e convertible preferred stock is deemed to be the equivalent of a preferred stock dividend

net cash used in operating activities for the years ended december    and was million  million  and million  respectively 
expenditures in all periods were a result of research and development expenses  general and administrative expenses in support of our operations and marketing expenses

at december   our aggregate investment in equipment and leasehold improvements was million 
we have an agreement with transamerica  a financing company  under which we have fully financed purchases of million of leasehold improvements  laboratory  computer and office equipment 
the terms are from to months and bear interest at rates ranging from to per year 
we also had a tenant improvement allowance of million from the lessor of our primary seattle  washington facility 
as of december   we had committed all of the allowance for laboratory and manufacturing space at this facility 
the improvement allowance bears interest at the rate of per year and is repaid monthly over the length of the original lease 
in  we will continue to fund our capital equipment and leasehold improvements through financing facilities 
in january  we entered a million lease line agreement with ge life sciences and technology financing  a division of general electric 
the agreement expires on june  in june  we entered into an equity line facility with bny capital markets  inc  or cmi  a registered broker dealer  providing for the potential future issuance by us to cmi of shares of our common stock 
under the equity line facility  cmi has committed to purchase  subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions  up to million of our common stock until the expiration of the agreement on june  we may issue common stock under the equity line facility with a value equal to no less than  and no more than million per drawdown period  with each drawdown period lasting from one to five trading days  at our discretion

we may deliver as many separate drawdown notices to cmi as we choose during the term of the agreement  provided that we may not deliver a drawdown notice during any ongoing drawdown period 
we are under no obligation to issue any minimum number of drawdown requests 
if we do not issue at least million of our common stock to cmi under the equity line facility prior to its termination  we will pay cmi  pro rated for issuances prior to the termination 
we also agreed to pay future fees to shoreline pacific  llc  which assisted us as placement agent in this transaction  equal to of each drawdown under the equity line facility

table of contents on january   we filed a shelf registration statement with the sec to register to sell up to million of our common stock from time to time 
the sec declared this registration statement effective on january  under this registration statement  we may sell our common stock pursuant to the prospectus and an accompanying prospectus supplement directly to purchasers  to or through underwriters or dealers  through agents  or through a combination of such methods 
in the event that we offer our stock directly to purchasers or to purchasers through agents  the shares may be sold at a single closing and a single price  or at multiple closings and at multiple prices 
we expect that the price or prices for any such shares sold in such circumstances will reflect our negotiations with prospective investors  the market price of our common stock  recent trends in the market price of our common stock  other factors considered material by the prospective investors and  if applicable  consultation with any agent involved with the sale or sales 
as of january   we have paid to jp morgan  as private placement agent under this shelf registration statement  legal and other accounting fees in the amount of  to date we have not sold any of our common stock under this shelf registration statement 
under the terms of our agreement with corvas  we have agreed to limit drawdowns under our equity line facility with cmi and sales of our common stock under the shelf registration statement to a maximum of million and to effect such drawdowns or sales of stock only at prices at or above the closing price for our common stock on the nasdaq national market on february  or per share

the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt and lease obligations  including interest in thousands contractual commitments total year years years thereafter capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual commitments as of december   we anticipate that our cash on hand  and cash generated from our collaborative arrangements will be sufficient to enable us to meet our anticipated expenditures for at least the next months 
however  we may need additional financing prior to that time 
additional financing may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds through sales of our common stock under the shelf registration statement  should we need them  or are unable to draw down on our equity line facility when we need to do so because we cannot meet the required conditions or because we are otherwise restricted by the terms of our agreement with cmi from drawing down for example  each draw down is subject to a minimum floor closing price of  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our development programs and some of our clinical trials 
factors that may affect results of operations and financial condition we have a history of operating losses  we expect to continue to incur losses and we may never be profitable 
as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
operating losses have resulted principally from costs incurred in our research and development programs and from our general and 
table of contents administrative expenses in support of our operations  clinical trial expenses  and marketing expenses 
we have earned no significant revenues from product sales or royalties 
we do not expect to achieve significant product sales or royalty revenue for several years  and are not able to predict when we might do so  if ever 
we expect to incur additional operating losses in the future and these losses may increase significantly as we continue clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals  develop our product candidates  expand our operations and develop systems that support commercialization of our potential products 
our ability to achieve long term profitability is dependent upon obtaining regulatory approvals for our products and successfully commercializing our products alone or with third parties 
we may not be successful in obtaining regulatory approval and commercializing our products  and our operations may not be profitable even if any of our products under development are commercialized 
we may take longer to complete our clinical trials than we project  or we may not be able to complete them at all 
although for planning purposes we project the commencement  continuation and completion of our clinical trials  a number of factors  including regulatory requirements  scheduling conflicts with participating clinicians and clinical institutions  and difficulties in identifying and enrolling patients who meet trial eligibility criteria  may cause significant delays 
we may not commence or complete clinical trials involving any of our products as projected or may not conduct them successfully 
we rely on academic institutions  physician practices  and clinical research organizations to conduct  supervise or monitor some or all aspects of clinical trials involving our products 
we have less control over the timing and other aspects of these clinical trials than if we conducted the monitoring and supervision entirely on our own 
third parties may not perform their responsibilities for our clinical trials on our anticipated schedules or consistent with a clinical trial protocol  and may not perform data collection in a timely manner 
we rely on clinical research organizations to perform much of our data management and analysis 
they may not provide these services as or when required 
if we are unable to amend d to enroll only patients with gleason scores of or less and the other trial criteria as planned or fail to complete that clinical trial for any reason  or we otherwise fail to commence or complete  or experience delays in  any of our other present or planned clinical trials  our ability to conduct our business as currently planned could be materially affected 
our development costs will increase if we experience any future delays in our clinical trials for provenge or in clinical trials for our other potential products or if we need to perform more or larger clinical trials than planned 
if the delays or costs are significant  our financial results and our ability to commercialize our product candidates will be adversely affected 
if testing of a particular product candidate does not yield successful results  then we will be unable to commercialize that product 
we must demonstrate the safety and efficacy of our potential products in humans through extensive preclinical and clinical testing 
we may experience numerous unforeseen events during  or as a result of  the testing process that could delay or prevent commercialization of our potential products  including the following safety and efficacy results obtained in human clinical trials  as in our provenge trials  may not be replicated in later clinical trials  the results of preclinical studies may be inconclusive  or they may not be indicative of results that will be obtained in human clinical trials  after reviewing preclinical testing or human clinical trial results  we or our collaborators may abandon or substantially restructure projects that we might previously have believed to be promising  including provenge  mylovenge  apc and trp p  
table of contents we  our collaborators or regulators may suspend or terminate clinical trials if the participating subjects or patients are being exposed to unacceptable health risks or for other reasons  and the effects of our potential products may not be the desired effects or may include undesirable side effects or other characteristics that preclude regulatory approval or limit their commercial use if approved 
clinical testing is very expensive  takes many years  and the outcome is uncertain 
d  our first phase iii clinical trial for provenge  did not meet its primary endpoint 
although the analysis identified a group of patients who were benefited by treatment with provenge  we may not obtain favorable results from the clinical study of more patients in this group in our amended phase iii trial  d b  or those results may cause the fda to require additional studies 
data from our clinical trials may not be sufficient to support approval by the fda of our potential products 
the clinical trials of provenge or our other product candidates under development may not be completed as planned and the fda may not ultimately approve any of our product candidates for commercial sale 
if we fail to adequately demonstrate the safety or efficacy of a cancer vaccine under development  this will delay or prevent regulatory approval of the vaccine  which could prevent us from achieving profitability 
if our products are not accepted by the market  we will not generate significant revenues or become profitable 
the success of any product we may develop will depend upon the medical community  patients and third party payors accepting our products as medically useful  cost effective  and safe 
we cannot guarantee that any of our products in development  if approved for commercialization  will be used by doctors to treat patients 
the degree of market acceptance for our products depends upon a number of factors  including the receipt and scope of regulatory approvals  demonstration of the efficacy and safety of our products to the medical and patient community  the convenience and accessibility of our products for patients  the cost and advantages of our products compared to other available therapies  and reimbursement policies of government and third party payors 
we may require additional funding  and our future access to capital is uncertain 
it is expensive to develop cancer vaccines  monoclonal antibodies  small molecules and other products  and to conduct clinical trials for and commercialize our products 
we plan to continue to simultaneously conduct clinical trials and preclinical research for a number of products  which is costly 
our existing capital and future revenues may not be sufficient to support the expenses of our operations  the development of commercial infrastructure and the conduct of our clinical trials and preclinical research 
we may need to raise additional capital to fund operations  continue the research and development of our therapeutic products  conduct clinical trials  and commercialize our products 
we believe that our cash on hand and cash generated from our collaborative arrangements will be sufficient to meet our projected operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  we may need additional financing within this time frame depending on a number of factors  including the following the rate of progress and cost of our research and development and clinical trial activities  
table of contents the amount and timing of milestone payments we receive from our collaborators  the costs of developing the processes and systems to support fda approval of provenge  our timetable for and costs of manufacturing scale up  the development of marketing operations  and other activities related to the commercialization of provenge  our degree of success in developing provenge and our other products  the costs of preparing an application for fda approval of provenge  if we seek such approval  the emergence of competing technologies and other adverse market developments  and changes in or terminations of our existing collaboration and licensing arrangements 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms or at all 
if we are unable to raise additional funds  we may be required to delay  reduce or eliminate some of our clinical trials and some of our development programs 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  including under our equity line facility or by selling common stock pursuant to our shelf registration statement  further dilution to our existing stockholders may result 
we are subject to extensive regulation  which is costly  time consuming and may subject us to unanticipated delays 
even if we obtain regulatory approval for the commercial sale of any of our products  those products may still face regulatory difficulties 
our activities  including preclinical studies  clinical trials  cell processing and manufacturing are subject to extensive regulation by the fda and comparable authorities outside the united states 
preclinical studies involve laboratory evaluation of product characteristics and animal studies to assess the efficacy and safety of a potential product 
the fda regulates pre clinical studies under a series of regulations called the current good laboratory practices 
if we violate these regulations  the fda  in some cases  may invalidate the studies and require that we replicate those studies 
an investigational new drug application  or ind  must become effective before human clinical trials may commence 
the investigational new drug application is automatically effective days after receipt by the fda unless  before that time  the fda requests an extension to review the application  or raises concerns or questions about the design of the trials as described in the application 
in the latter case  we must resolve any outstanding concerns with the fda before clinical trials can proceed 
thus  the submission of an investigational new drug application may not result in the fda authorizing us to commence clinical trials in any given case 
after such authorization is received  the fda retains authority to place the ind  and clinical trials under that ind  on clinical hold 
we and third parties on whom we rely to assist us with clinical trials  are subject to extensive regulation by the fda in the design and conduct of those trials 
also  investigational products in clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with a series of complex regulations called current good manufacturing practice  or cgmp 
other products used in connection with our clinical trials must be manufactured in accordance with regulations called the quality systems regulations  or qsr 
these regulations govern manufacturing processes and procedures and the implementation and operation of quality systems to control and assure the quality of our investigational products 
we and third parties with whom we contract for manufacturing and cell processing must comply with cgmp or qsr  as applicable 
our facilities and quality systems and the facilities and quality systems of our third party collaborators must pass a pre approval inspection for compliance with the applicable regulations as a condition of fda approval of provenge or any of our other potential products 
in addition  the fda may  at any time  audit one of our clinical trials or audit or inspect a manufacturing or cell processing facility involved with the production of provenge or one of our other potential products or the associated quality systems for compliance with the regulations applicable to the activities being conducted 
if any such inspection 
table of contents or audit identifies noncompliance with applicable regulations  the fda may require remedial measures that are costly and or time consuming for us or a third party to implement and that may include the temporary or permanent suspension of a clinical trial or temporary or permanent closure of a facility 
the fda may also disqualify a clinical trial in whole or in part from consideration in support of approval of a potential product for commercial sale or otherwise deny approval of that product 
any such remedial measures imposed upon us or third parties with whom we contract could harm our business 
the process of obtaining required fda and other regulatory approvals  including foreign approvals  is expensive  often takes many years  and can vary substantially based upon the type  complexity and novelty of the products involved 
provenge and our other vaccine products are novel  therefore  regulatory agencies lack experience with them  which may lengthen the regulatory review process  increase our development costs and delay or prevent commercialization of provenge and our other products under development 
to date  no cancer vaccine using antigen presenting cell technologies has been approved for commercial sale in the united states 
consequently  there is no precedent for the successful commercialization of products based on our technologies 
in addition  we have had only limited experience in filing and pursuing the applications necessary to gain regulatory approvals for commercial sale  which may impede our ability to obtain fda approvals 
we have not yet sought fda approval for any vaccine product 
we will not be able to commercialize any of our potential products until we obtain fda approval 
therefore  any delay in obtaining  or inability to obtain  fda approval could harm our business 
if we are not in compliance with regulatory requirements at any stage  including post marketing approval  we may be fined  forced to remove a product from the market and experience other adverse consequences  including delay  which could materially harm our financial results 
additionally  we may not be able to obtain the labeling claims necessary or desirable for the promotion of our products 
we may also be required to undertake post marketing clinical trials 
if the results of such post marketing studies are not satisfactory  marketing authorization can be withdrawn or continued marketing conditioned on commitments from us that may be expensive and or time consuming to fulfill 
in addition  if we or others identify side effects after any of our products are on the market  or if manufacturing problems occur  regulatory approval may be withdrawn and reformulation of our products  additional clinical trials  changes in labeling of our products  and additional marketing applications may be required 
the availability and amount of reimbursement for our potential products and the manner in which government and private payors may reimburse for our potential products is uncertain  we may face challenges from government and private payors that adversely affect reimbursement for our potential products 
we expect that many of the patients who seek treatment with our products  if they are approved for marketing  will be eligible for medicare benefits 
other patients may be covered by private health plans or uninsured 
the application of existing medicare regulations and interpretive rulings to newly approved products  especially novel products such as ours  is not certain and those regulations and interpretive rulings are subject to change 
if we are unable to obtain or retain adequate levels of reimbursement from medicare or from private health plans  our ability to sell our potential products will be adversely affected 
medicare regulations and interpretive rulings also may determine who may be reimbursed for certain services 
this may adversely affect our ability to market or sell our potential products  if approved 
federal and state governments  and foreign governments as well  continue to propose legislation designed to contain or reduce health care costs 
legislation and regulations affecting the pricing of products like our potential products may change or be adopted before any of our potential products are approved for marketing 
cost control initiatives could decrease the price that we receive for any one or all of our potential products or increase patient coinsurance to a level that makes our products under development unaffordable 
in addition  government and private health plans persistently challenge the price and cost effectiveness of therapeutic products 
therefore  any one or all of our products under development may ultimately not be considered cost effective by these third party 
table of contents payors and thus may not be covered under their health plans or covered only at a lower price 
any of these initiatives or developments could prevent us from successfully marketing and selling any of our potential products 
we rely on third parties to perform a variety of functions and have limited manufacturing and cell processing capabilities  which could limit our ability to commercialize our products 
we rely in part on collaborators and other third parties to perform for us or assist us with a variety of important functions  including research and development  cell processing  manufacturing and clinical trials management 
we also license technology from others to enhance or supplement our technologies 
we have never manufactured our cancer vaccines and other potential products on a commercial scale 
it may be difficult or impossible to economically manufacture our products on a commercial scale 
we have contracted with diosynth rtp  inc to assist us in the scale up to commercial level production of the antigen used in the preparation of provenge 
we cannot be certain that this contract will result in our ability to produce the antigen for provenge on a commercial scale  if provenge is approved for commercial sale 
we intend to rely on third party contract manufacturers to produce large quantities of materials needed for clinical trials and product commercialization 
third party manufacturers may not be able to meet our needs with respect to timing  quantity or quality 
if we are unable to contract for a sufficient supply of needed materials on acceptable terms  or if we should encounter delays or difficulties in our relationships with manufacturers  our submission of products for regulatory approval or the market introduction and subsequent sales of our products may be delayed 
any delay may lower our revenues and potential profitability and adversely affect our stock price 
we operate a facility for cell processing and the manufacture of antigens for our clinical trials 
we also contract with third parties to provide these services 
these facilities may not be sufficient to meet our needs for our provenge and other clinical trials 
additionally  if we decide to manufacture any of our potential products in commercial quantities ourselves  we will require substantial additional funds and will be required to hire and train a significant number of employees  construct additional facilities and comply with applicable regulations for these facilities  which are extensive 
we may not be able to develop production facilities that both meet regulatory requirements and are sufficient for our clinical trials or for commercial use 
if we lose or are unable to secure collaborators  or if our collaborators  including kirin and genentech  do not apply adequate resources to their collaborations with us  our product development and potential for profitability may suffer 
we intend to continue to enter into collaborations for one or more of the research  development  manufacturing  marketing and other commercialization activities relating to some of our products under development 
we have entered into a collaboration with kirin relating to the development and commercialization in asia of our products based on our antigen presenting cell technologies 
as our collaborator  kirin funds testing  makes regulatory filings and may manufacture and market our licensed products in asia 
we have also entered into a collaboration with genentech for preclinical research  clinical development  and commercialization of monoclonal antibodies and potentially other products derived from our trp p gene platform 
the amount and timing of resources applied by kirin or genentech or other potential collaborators to our joint efforts are not within our control 
if any collaborator breaches or terminates its agreement with us  or fails to conduct its collaborative activities in a timely manner  the commercialization of our products under development could be slowed down or blocked completely 
it is possible that kirin  genentech or other potential collaborators will change their strategic focus  pursue alternative technologies or develop alternative products  either on their own or in collaboration with others  to treat the diseases targeted by our collaborative programs 
it is also possible that a collaborator may conduct a clinical trial or other activities with respect to one or more of our potential products which has results or consequences that reflect adversely upon that product and harm our ability to develop that 
table of contents product or obtain fda approval for its commercial sale 
the effectiveness of our collaborators in marketing our products will also affect our revenues and earnings 
our collaborations with kirin and genentech may not continue or be successful and we may not receive any further research funding  milestone or royalty payments 
we recognized approximately and of our revenue in and  respectively  from our collaboration with kirin 
we intend to continue to enter into new collaborative agreements in the future 
however  we may not be able to successfully negotiate any additional collaborative arrangements 
if established  these relationships may not be scientifically or commercially successful 
any additional collaborations would likely subject us to some or all of the risks described above with respect to our collaborations with kirin and genentech 
disputes may arise between us and our existing or potential future collaborators as to a variety of matters  including financial or other obligations under our agreements 
these disputes may be both expensive and time consuming and may result in delays in the development and commercialization of products 
we are dependent on single source vendors for some of our components 
we currently depend on single source vendors for some of the components necessary for our vaccine candidates  such as cell culture media 
there are  in general  relatively few alternative sources of supply for these products 
while these vendors have produced our products with acceptable quality  quantity and cost in the past  they may be unable or unwilling to meet our future demands 
establishing additional or replacement suppliers for these products could take a substantial amount of time 
if we have to switch to a replacement vendor  the manufacture and delivery of our vaccines could be interrupted for an extended period 
if we are unable to protect our proprietary rights  we may not be able to compete effectively or operate profitably 
our success is dependent in part on obtaining  maintaining and enforcing our patents and other proprietary rights and our ability to avoid infringing the proprietary rights of others 
patent law relating to the scope of claims in the biotechnology field in which we operate is still evolving and  consequently  patent positions in our industry may not be as strong as in other more well established fields 
accordingly  the united states patent and trademark office may not issue patents from the patent applications owned by or licensed to us 
if issued  the patents may not give us an advantage over competitors with similar technology 
it is also possible that third parties may successfully avoid our patents through design innovation 
the issuance of a patent is not conclusive as to its validity or enforceability and it is uncertain how much protection  if any  will be given to our patents if we attempt to enforce them and their validity is challenged in court or in other proceedings  such as oppositions  which may be brought in domestic or foreign jurisdictions 
a third party may challenge the validity or enforceability of a patent after its issuance by the united states patent and trademark office 
it is possible that a third party may successfully challenge our patents or patents licensed by us from others  or that a challenge will result in limiting the coverage of our patents 
the cost of litigation to uphold the validity of patents and to prevent infringement can be substantial and  if the outcome of litigation is adverse to us  third parties may be able to use our patented invention without payment to us 
moreover  it is possible that third parties may infringe our patents 
to stop these activities we may need to file a lawsuit 
even if we were successful in stopping the violation of our patent rights  these lawsuits are very expensive and consume time and other resources 
in addition  there is a risk that a court would decide that our patents are not valid and that we do not have the right to stop the other party from using the invention 
there is also the risk that  even if the validity of our patents is upheld  a court will refuse to stop the other party on the grounds that its activities are not covered by  that is  do not infringe  our patents 
in addition to the intellectual property rights described above  we also rely on unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
therefore  others may independently develop substantially equivalent information and techniques or otherwise gain access to or disclose our technology 
we may not be able to 
table of contents effectively protect our rights in unpatented technology  trade secrets and confidential information 
we require each of our officers  employees  consultants and advisors  and our manufacturers and vendors  as appropriate  to execute a confidentiality agreement at the commencement of an employment or consulting relationship with us 
however  these agreements may not provide effective protection of our information or  in the event of unauthorized use or disclosure  they may not provide adequate remedies 
the use of our technologies could potentially conflict with the rights of others 
our competitors or others may have or acquire patent rights that they could enforce against us 
if they do so  then we may be required to alter our products  pay licensing fees or cease activities 
if our products conflict with patent rights of others  third parties could bring legal actions against us claiming damages and seeking to enjoin manufacturing and marketing of the affected products 
if these legal actions are successful  in addition to any potential liability for damages  we could be required to obtain a license in order to continue to manufacture or market the affected products 
we may not prevail in any legal action and a required license under the patent may not be available on acceptable terms or at all 
we may incur substantial costs as a result of litigation or other proceedings relating to patent and other intellectual property rights 
the cost to us of any litigation or other proceeding relating to intellectual property rights  even if resolved in our favor  could be substantial 
some of our competitors may be better able to sustain the costs of complex patent litigation because they have substantially greater resources 
if there is litigation against us  we may not be able to continue our operations 
should third parties file patent applications  or be issued patents claiming technology also claimed by us in pending applications  we may be required to participate in interference proceedings in the united states patent and trademark office to determine priority of invention 
we may be required to participate in interference proceedings involving our issued patents and pending applications 
we may be required to cease using the technology or to license rights from prevailing third parties as a result of an unfavorable outcome in an interference proceeding 
a prevailing party in that case may not offer us a license on commercially acceptable terms 
we are exposed to potential product liability claims  and insurance against these claims may not be available to us at a reasonable rate in the future 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks which are inherent in the testing  manufacturing  marketing and sale of pharmaceutical products 
we have clinical trial insurance coverage and we intend to obtain product liability insurance coverage in the future 
however  this insurance coverage may not be available to us at an acceptable cost  if at all 
we may not be able to obtain future insurance coverage that will be adequate to satisfy any liability that may arise 
regardless of their merit or eventual outcome  product liability claims may result in decreased demand for a product  injury to our reputation  withdrawal of clinical trial volunteers and loss of revenues 
thus  whether or not we are insured  a product liability claim or product recall may result in losses that could be material 
competition in our industry is intense  and many of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do 
competition in the cancer and autoimmune disease fields is intense and is accentuated by the rapid pace of technological development 
research and discoveries by others may result in breakthroughs which may render our products obsolete even before they generate any revenue 
there are products currently under development by others that could compete with the products that we are developing 
many of our competitors have substantially 
table of contents greater research and development capabilities and manufacturing  marketing  financial and managerial resources than we do 
our competitors may develop safer or more effective therapeutics vaccines and other therapeutic products  reach the market more rapidly  reducing the potential sales of our products  or establish superior proprietary positions 
we understand that companies  including avi biopharma  inc  cell genesys  inc  and therion biologics corporation  may be developing prostate cancer vaccines that could potentially compete with provenge  if provenge is successfully developed 
other products such as chemotherapeutics  antisense compounds  angiogenesis inhibitors  and gene therapies are also under development and could potentially compete with provenge 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter our markets and as scientific developments surrounding therapeutic vaccines and other cancer therapies accelerate 
if our products receive marketing approval but cannot compete effectively in the marketplace  our profitability and financial position would suffer 
we must expand our operations to commercialize our products  which we may not be able to do 
we will need to expand and effectively manage our operations and facilities to successfully pursue and complete future research  development and commercialization efforts 
to grow  we will need to add personnel and expand our capabilities  which may strain our existing managerial  operational  financial and other resources 
to compete effectively and manage our growth  we must train  manage and motivate our employees  accurately forecast demand for our products  expand existing operational  financial and management information systems  and hire sufficient sales force to generate revenue 
if we fail to manage our growth effectively  our product development and commercialization efforts could be curtailed or delayed 
if we lose key management and scientific personnel or cannot recruit qualified employees  our product development programs and our research and development efforts will be harmed 
our success depends  to a significant extent  upon the efforts and abilities of our key employees 
the loss of the services of one or more of our key employees may delay our product development programs and our research and development efforts 
we do not maintain key person life insurance on any of our officers  employees or consultants 
competition for qualified employees among companies in the biotechnology and biopharmaceutical industry is intense 
our future success depends upon our ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
in order to commercialize our products successfully  we may be required to expand our workforce substantially  particularly in the areas of manufacturing  clinical trials management  quality  regulatory affairs  business development and sales and marketing 
these activities will require the addition of new personnel  including management  and the development of additional expertise by existing management personnel 

table of contents market volatility may affect our stock price and the value of an investment in our common stock may be subject to sudden decreases 
the trading price for our common stock has been  and we expect it to continue to be  volatile 
the price at which our common stock trades depends upon a number of factors  including our historical and anticipated operating results  preclinical and clinical trial results  market perception of the prospects for biotechnology companies as an industry sector and general market and economic conditions  some of which are beyond our control 
factors such as fluctuations in our financial and operating results  changes in government regulations affecting product approvals  reimbursement or other aspects of our or our competitors businesses  fda review of our product development activities  the results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  announcements of technological innovations or new commercial products by us or our competitors  developments concerning key personnel and our intellectual property rights  significant collaborations or strategic alliances and publicity regarding actual or potential performance of products under development by us or our competitors could also cause the market price of our common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  the stock market has from time to time experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations 
these broad market fluctuations may lower the market price of our common stock 
moreover  during periods of stock market price volatility  share prices of many biotechnology companies have often fluctuated in a manner not necessarily related to their individual operating performance 
accordingly  our common stock may be subject to greater price volatility than the stock market as a whole 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and under delaware law and our stockholders rights plan could make an acquisition of us  which may be beneficial to our stockholders  more difficult 
provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws will make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us on terms not approved by our board of directors and may have the effect of deterring hostile takeover attempts 
for example  our certificate of incorporation currently authorizes our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock  of which  shares have been designated as series a junior participating preferred stock  and to fix the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of our common stock will be subject to  and may be harmed by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock could reduce the voting power of the holders of our common stock and the likelihood that common stockholders will receive payments upon liquidation 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation divides our board of directors into three classes having staggered terms 
we are also subject to provisions of delaware law that could have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our company 
one of these provisions prevents us from engaging in a business combination with any interested stockholder for a period of three years from the date the person becomes an interested stockholder  unless specified conditions are satisfied 
we have also implemented a stockholders rights plan  also called a poison pill  that would substantially reduce or eliminate the expected economic benefit to an acquirer from acquiring us in a manner or on terms not approved by our board of directors 
these and other impediments to a third party acquisition or change of control could limit the price investors are willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders have substantial control over us  which could delay or prevent a change in our corporate control favored by our other stockholders 
as of february   our executive officers  directors and principal stockholders beneficially owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
these stockholders will likely continue to exercise substantial influence over us for the foreseeable future  even if we should issue common stock pursuant to our shelf registration statement or under our equity line facility 
accordingly  these stockholders  individually and as a group  may be able to control us and direct our officers and business  including any determination with respect to a change in control  future issuances of our common stock or other securities  declarations of dividends on our common stock and the election of our board of directors 

table of contents if registration rights that we have previously granted are exercised  then our stock price may be negatively affected 
we have granted registration rights in connection with the issuance of our securities to a number of our principal stockholders and warrant holders 
in the aggregate  as of december   these registration rights covered approximately  shares of our common stock which were then outstanding and an additional  shares of our common stock which may become outstanding upon the exercise of warrants that were then outstanding 
if these registration rights  or similar registration rights that may apply to securities we may issue in the future  are exercised by the holders  it could result in additional sales of our common stock in the market  which may have an adverse effect on our stock price 
our issuance of shares under our equity line facility will dilute the equity ownership of our existing stockholders 
under our equity line financing agreement with bny capital markets  inc  or cmi  we may  at our option and subject to the satisfaction of specified conditions  issue to cmi an aggregate of up to  shares of our common stock from time to time through june  the precise number of shares of our common stock that we will issue to cmi over the remaining term of the equity line financing agreement will depend primarily on the number of drawdowns we choose to undertake  the amounts of those drawdowns and the closing market price of our common stock during the drawdown periods 
each of our issuances of common stock to cmi under the equity line facility will proportionately decrease our existing stockholders percentage ownership of our total outstanding equity interests 
transactions by cmi may adversely affect the price of our common stock 
from time to time during drawdown periods  within limitations specified in our equity line facility with cmi and subject to applicable laws  cmi may engage in hedging and other transactions in our common stock  and may sell and deliver shares of our common stock issued under the equity line facility in connection with these transactions 
if cmi engages in such transactions  the price of our common stock may be adversely affected 
the actual or anticipated sale by us of common stock under our shelf registration statement or resale by cmi of shares of our common stock that it purchases from us under the equity line facility or otherwise owns or acquires may have an adverse impact on the market price of our common stock 
the sale by us of common stock under our shelf registration statement or resale by cmi of the common stock that it purchases from us under the equity line facility or that it otherwise owns or acquires may  depending upon the timing of the resales  depress the market price of our common stock 
moreover  as all the shares we sell under our shelf registration statement or to cmi will be available for immediate resale  the mere prospect of such sales could depress the market price of our common stock 
in addition  actual or anticipated downward pressure on the market price of our common stock due to actual or anticipated sales under the shelf registration statement or resales of our common stock by cmi could cause some institutions or individuals to engage in short sales of our common stock  which may itself cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as of december   we had short term investments of million and long term investments of million 
our short term and long term investments are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
the estimated fair value of our short and long term investments  assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates  would decrease by  which would not materially impact our operations 
we limit our exposure to adjustable interest rates on our lease line by capping the interest rate at a fixed amount
