item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations for the years ended december    and the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of psb should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of psb  including the related notes thereto  included elsewhere herein 
general psb s results of operations depend primarily on the bank s net interest income  which is the difference between interest income on interest earning assets  and interest expense on its interest bearing liabilities 
its interest earning assets consist primarily of loans receivable  investment securities  and interest earning deposits while its interest bearing liabilities consist primarily of deposits 
the bank s net income is also affected by its provision for loan losses and its level of non interest income as well as by its non interest expense  such as salary and employee benefits  occupancy costs and charges relating to non performing and other classified assets 
impact of inflation the financial statements and related financial data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles which require the measurement of financial position and operating results in historical dollars without considering changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the primary impact of inflation on the operation of the bank is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services 
critical accounting policies  judgments and estimates statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  it also specifies criteria that intangible assets acquired in a purchase method business combination must meet to be recognized and reported apart from goodwill 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite useful lives no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
in connection with sfas no 
 transitional goodwill impairment evaluation  on january   after the reevaluation of certain deferred assets relating to the acquisition of jade financial corp  psb recognized a cumulative effect of an accounting change of million which represented the remaining unamortized portion of negative goodwill 
allowance for credit losses psb uses the reserve method of accounting for credit losses 
the balance in the allowance for loan losses is determined based on management s review and evaluaton of the loan portfolio in relation to past loss experience  the size and composition of the portfolio  current economic events and conditions  and other pertinent factors  including management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses 
increases to the allowance for loan and lease losses are made by charges to the provision for credit losses 
credit exposures deemed to be uncollectible are charged against the allowance for credit losses 
recoveries of previously charged off amounts are credited to the allowance for credit losses 
while management considers the allowance for loan and lease losses to be adequate based on information currently available  future additions to the allowance may be necessary due to changes in economic conditions or management s assumptions as to future delinquencies  recoveries and losses and management s intent with regard to the disposition of loans and leases 
in addition  the regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically reviews psb s allowance for loan losses 
the regulators may require the banks to recognize additions to the allowance for credit losses based on their judgements about information available to them at the time of their examination 
income taxes under the liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
based upon the review of all components of the deferred tax assets and liabilitites  future taxable income of psb and regulatory guidelines  management has determined that no allowance is deemed necessary at december  however  circumstances could arise that would require management to revisit the need for such an allowance 
performance overview psb s net income for was million or on a diluted per share basis before the cumulative effect of an accounting change and million or on a diluted per share basis after the cumulative effect of an accounting change  compared to net income of million or per diluted share for and net income of  or per diluted share for the results for were impacted by an additional provision for loan losses of  or per share in the fourth quarter and non recurring expenses related to the cost of a computerized accounting system conversion during of  or per share 
psb also realized a facility fee of  or per share in the fourth quarter 
the overall increase in psb s revenue in from was primarily due the acquisition of the income producing assets of jade  and a million equity investment write down in upon adoption of sfas no 
 on january   after the revaluation of certain deferred assets relating to the acquisition of jade  psb recognized a cumulative effect of an accounting change of million which represented the remaining unamortized portion of negative goodwill related to the jade acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  management increased the loan loss reserve by  in accordance with the application of staff accounting bulletin sab no 
for calculating the reserve for loan losses 
the additional provision was not necessitated by any specific problem loan but was based on an expected increase in the commercial and consumer loan portfolio which is more susceptible to risk  as well as any adjustments to the economic component analysis 
management believed an increase in the loan loss reserve was warranted 
on november   the bank completed a successful core hardware and software conversion to the osi system from the fiserv summit system to enhance the quality of our banking services at a cost of  management recognized that the fiserv summit system was satisfactory for the short term needs of the bank  however  it was determined that the system would not be adequate to support the bank s future growth plans as a commercial bank 
additionally  psb received a facility fee of  in partial consideration for the origination of a commercial real estate loan 
the borrower agreed to pay to the bank a fee equal to of the borrower s net receipts 
this amount was payable upon the occurrence of i the sale by the borrower of its interest in the real property  or ii the date that is six months after the date the borrower acquires title to all or a portion of the real property 
the bank realized a facility fee income of  in the fourth quarter of from this loan 
net interest income and average balances net interest income is the key component of the bank s profitability structure and is managed in coordination with the bank s interest rate sensitivity position 
net interest income in of million was million or higher than net interest income of million 
the bank s net interest income of million in was million or higher than s net interest income of million 
in  total interest income increased million to million from million in in total interest income increased million to million from million in the bank had a decrease in total interest expense in of  compared to an increase in of million 
in  both net interest income  and interest income increased primarily due to the acquisition of the jade loan portfolio 
the bank s net interest margin  net interest income divided by total average interest earning assets  increased basis points to in from in the increase is related to a facility fee of  realized in the fourth quarter and an improvement in the bank s yield on other interest earning assets and a lower cost of funds primarily time deposits and borrowed funds 
in  the net interest margin decreased basis points to in from in  primarily due to an increase in the volume of the bank s variable rate loan portfolio due to the acquisition of jade and an overall decline of interest rates resulting from a steady reduction of the prime rate by the federal reserve 
the bank s net interest spread  the difference between the yield on interest earning assets and the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities  increased basis points to in from in in  the bank experienced a decrease of basis points to from for during the twelve month period of  the bank experienced an overall increase in interest earning assets of basis points to in from in and an overall decrease in interest bearing liabilities 
the rate paid on those liabilities decreased by basis points to in from in although in  the bank experienced an overall increase in interest bearing liabilities  the rate paid on those liabilities decreased by basis points to from in  while the yield earned on interest earning assets decreased a greater basis points  resulting in the compression of the net interest spread 
the bank s yield on average interest earning assets increased to for compared to in in  the bank s yield on average interest earning assets was 
average loans of million at december  represented of total interest earning assets  providing an average yield of  average loans of million at december   represented of total average interest earning assets  and provided an average yield of  compared to average loans of million at december   representing of total average interest earning assets  and providing an average yield of 
the basis point increase in the yield on the loan portfolio in was primarily due to a  facility fee received in the fourth quarter 
the substantial decrease in the yield on the loan portfolio in was due to the general decrease in overall interest rates due to numerous and rapid decreases in the federal funds rate inacted by the federal reserve 
average investments and interest earning deposits with banks increased million or at december   compared to an increase of million or at december  at december   average investments and interest earning deposits with banks increased million or to million  from million at december  the increase in average investments and interest earning deposits with banks in is primarily due to an increase in deposits and a decrease in loans 
due to the volatile market  consumers have become more conservative in investing their funds 
instead of investing in the stock market they have chosen to invest in safer instruments such as money markets and time deposits 
due to the competitive market on interest rates  the bank has experienced a high volume of run off of consumer and mortgage loans 
at december   total average interest bearing liabilities increased million or to million compared to million at december  total average interest bearing liabilities decreased million or to million at december   from million at december  total interest expense decreased  at december  to million as compared to a total interest expense decrease of million to million at december   from million in the bank s cost of funds over the last three years was in  in and in the increase in the psb s liquidity position at december  is attributable to higher than anticipated prepayments on loans and investment securities  an increase in deposit activity  lower than anticipated loan volume in the fourth quarter of  and the uncertainties within the current interest rate environment 
as management continues to implement its strategic mission of growth and profitability by deploying more liquid assets for continued loan growth  primarily in consumer and commercial lending  liquidity levels will resume more acceptable and traditional target levels and ratios 
to the extent that liquidity exceeds projected levels  excess liquidity will be reinvested in the bank s normal investment activities

the bank determines the level of the allowance for loan losses through a regular review of the loan portfolio 
management s evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is based upon an examination of the portfolio as well as such factors as declining trends  the volume of loan concentrations  adverse situations that may affect the borrower s ability to pay  prior loss experience within the portfolio  current economic conditions and the results of the most recent regulatory examinations 
the bank allocated million   and  as additions to the allowance for loan loss and had charge offs against the allowance of   and for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the additional provision was not necessitated by any specific problem loan 
based on an expected increase in the commercial and consumer loan portfolios which are more susceptible to risk  as well as any adjustments to the economic component analysis  management believes an increase in the loan loss reserve was warranted 
the methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss considers both risk and economic factors 
the analysis includes all types of loans  with the applied methodology commensurate to the risk assessment for the portfolio and present economic conditions 
the risk rating of the loan portfolio is updated quarterly by management and utilized for an overall assessment of the loan loss reserve adequacy  the results of which are reported quarterly to the board 
the results of the assessment of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve  utilizing the risk ratings and economic factors  receive the close attention of management on an ongoing basis  with appropriate revisions made to the methodology in accordance with regulatory standards  changes in lending policies  economic business conditions  past due classified loans  quality of loan review  concentration of credit  and examination input 
it is important to note that an effective internal loan review function is an essential element in satisfactorily implementing the bank s methodology 
although management utilizes its best judgment in providing for loan losses  there can be no assurance that the bank will not have to increase its provision for loan losses in the future as a result of possible future increases to its non performing loans or for other reasons based on changes in facts and circumstances 
in addition  various regulatory agencies  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses and the carrying value of its non performing assets 
such agencies may require the bank to recognize additions to its allowance for loan losses based on their judgments about information available to them at the time of their examination

non interest income increased million or to million in  which is primarily due to the bank receiving a full year of service fees and other income of jade compared to six months in because the merger of jade was not effective until july  the increase in the volume of non interest income in is attributable to the acquisition of the fee bearing deposit accounts of jade and the income associated with the bank owned life insurance investment acquired from jade

in and the increase in non interest expense is primarily related to expenses incurred in the acquisition of jade  reflecting a full year of non interest expense in and six months in income taxes psb accounts for income taxes under the liability method specified by sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under sfas no 
 deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
under sfas no 
 the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the principal types of accounts resulting in differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are the allowance for loan losses  leased assets  deferred loan fees and compensation 
psb had an income tax provision of million   and  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
liquidity and interest rate sensitivity integral to the management of psb s balance sheet is the maintenance of adequate liquidity and the ability to evaluate and control interest rate risk 
liquidity represents the ability to meet potential cash outflows resulting from deposit customers who need to withdraw funds or borrowers who need available credit 
interest rate sensitivity focuses on the impact of fluctuating interest rates and the repricing characteristics of rate sensitive assets and liabilities on net interest income 
psb s asset liability management committee monitors the level of short term assets and liabilities to maintain an appropriate balance between liquidity  risk  and return 
liquidity is derived from various sources that include increases in core deposits  sales of certificates of deposits  loan principal repayments  loan maturities  and cash received on maturities or amortization of investment securities 
the liquidity position of psb is also strengthened by the availability of a million credit facility with the fhlb 
advances are secured by fhlb stock and qualifying mortgage loans 
there were no advances outstanding against this line at december  or at december  management anticipates utilizing its liquidity to increase its commercial lending portfolio during the first half of in order to achieve this  management hired three additional commercial lending officers 
additional liquidity will be utilized to increase the company s investment security portfolio in accordance with current alco policies and procedures 
maximizing cash flow over time is crucial to the maintenance of adequate liquidity 
psb s total cash flow is a product of its operating activities  investing activities and financing activities 
during the twelve month period ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to net cash used by operating activities of million for the same period of during the twelve month period ended december   net cash provided by investing activities was million  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million for the same period of financing activities provided net cash of million during the twelve months ended december   compared to million in net cash provided in financing activities for the same period of the net result of these items was a million increase in cash and cash equivalents for the twelve month period ended december   compared to a million increase in cash and cash equivalents for the same period of the increase in cash and cash equivalents in is primarily due to the proceeds received from maturing investments of million  consumer and residential loan due to payoffs of approximately million  and an increase in deposits of million 
during  net cash provided by operating activities was million  investing activities provided million in net cash and psb s financing activities used million in net cash 
the major components within these two categories during were an increase in total loans receivable of million and a decrease in investments purchased of million 
the net result of these items was a  increase in cash and cash equivalents for interest rate risk management is closely related to liquidity management because each is directly affected by the maturity of assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk management monitors the effect that fluctuations in interest rates have on net interest income 
the primary function of psb s interest rate sensitivity management is to reduce exposure to interest rate risk through an appropriate balance between interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the goal is to minimize fluctuations in the net interest margin of the bank due to general changes in interest rates 
the net interest margin of a bank that does not have a relatively close relationship between the quantity of assets that mature or re price within a given time period and the quantity of liabilities that mature or re price within the same time period will fluctuate more widely than a bank that has a closer match 
furthermore  a bank that has liabilities that reprice earlier than its assets will have a decline in its net interest margin as interest rates rise 
the blending of fixed and floating rate loans and investments to match their pricing and maturity characteristics against those of the various funding sources is a continuous process in an attempt to minimize fluctuations in net interest income caused by changes in interest rates 
the composition of the balance sheet is designed to minimize any significant fluctuation in net interest income and to maximize liquidity 
one tool used by management to gauge the structure of the balance sheet is a gap analysis that categorizes assets and liabilities on the basis of maturity date  the date of next re pricing  and the applicable amortization schedule 
this analysis summarizes the matching or mismatching of rate sensitive assets versus rate sensitive liabilities according to specified time periods 
management concentrates on the zero to three month and one year gap intervals 
at december   psb had a one year negative gap of million and a gap ratio of or of total assets as of that date 
the following table shows the interest rate sensitive data at december  in thousands interest rate sensitivity analysis balance more than no stated at gap table at december  months months yrs yrs maturity interest bearing deposits with banks    investment securities       mortgage loans      commercial loans      consumer loans     construction loans     loan loss reserve   other assets   total assets       non interest bearing deposits    now accounts    money market accounts    savings accounts    time deposits      borrowed funds  other liabilities   total liabilities       shareholder s equity   total liabilities and shareholder s equity       gap      gap ratio cumulative gap     cumulative gap ratio management also simulates possible economic conditions and interest rate scenarios in order to quantify the impact on interest income 
the effect that changing interest rates have on psb s net interest income is simulated by increasing and deceasing interest rates 
this simulation is known as rate shocking 
the report below forecasts changes in psb s market value of equity under alternative interest rate environments 
the market value of equity is defined as the net present value of psb s existing assets and liabilities 
change in market value market value percentage of equity of equity change basis points   basis points   basis points   flat rate  basis points   basis points   basis points   a plus or minus basis point rate shock test for the internal rate of return indicates at most limited economic value sensitivity to changes in interest rates 
a rate shock internal rate of return test indicates internal rate of return reductions as rates rise and larger losses as rates decline 
the bank s largest exposure is a reduction in the internal rate of return in a minus basis point scenario and a loss of in a plus basis point scenario 
in the event psb should experience a mismatch in its desired gap ranges or and excessive decline in its market value of equity resulting from changes in interest rates  it has a number of options which it could utilize to remedy such a mismatch 
psb could restructure its investment portfolio through the sale or purchase of securities with more favorable repricing attributes 
it could also emphasize growth in loan products with appropriate maturities or repricing attributes  or attract deposits or obtain borrowings with desired maturities 
there are no known trends or any known demands  commitments  events or uncertainties that will result in  or that are reasonably likely to result in liquidity increasing or decreasing in any material way 
the commitment expiration periods for commitments of the company as of december  are as follows commitment period total amount one year committed or less yrs yrs over yrs commitments lines of credit    unfunded residential mortgages   standby letters of credit   leases   total commitments    capital adequacy the bank is required to maintain minimum ratios of tier i and total capital to total risk weighted assets and a minimum tier i leverage ratio  as defined by the banking regulators 
at december   the bank was required to have minimum tier i and total capital ratios of and  respectively  and a minimum tier i leverage ratio of 
the bank s actual tier i and total capital ratios at december  were and  respectively  and the bank s tier i leverage ratio was 
these ratios exceed the requirements for classification as a well capitalized institution  the industry s highest capital category 
capital ratios increased during over due to a increase in net income versus only a increase in total risk adjusted assets 
capital ratios decreased during over due to a increase in total risk adjusted assets due to the acquisition of jade and a decrease in tier and total capital from to following are the bank s capital ratios at december   and dollars in thousands tier i capital    tier ii capital    total qualifying capital    risk adjusted total assets    tier i risk based capital ratio total risk based capital ratio leverage ratio average assets    management is confident that the bank will remain well capitalized 
financial condition general the company s total assets increased to million at december  this represents an increase of compared to assets of million at december  the increase is attributable to the rapid deposit growth of the bank 
at december   psb s net loan portfolio inclusive of loans held for sales  totaled million as compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease of million or is primarily the result of an increase in payoffs of consumer and mortgage loans 
investment activities the bank s investment portfolio is comprised of mortgage backed securities  investment securities  and cash and cash equivalents 
the carrying value of the bank s investment securities and mortgaged backed securities portfolio totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the bank s cash and cash equivalents  consisting of cash and due from banks  and interest earning deposits with other financial institutions  totaled million at december   compared to million at december  the deposit growth in the bank was attributable to a general trend of consumers choosing to invest their assets in the safety of bank instruments versus th stock market 
the majority of the bank s mortgage backed securities are issued or guaranteed by the united states government or agencies thereof 
at december   mortgage backed securities totaled million compared to million at december  the majority of this amount represents securities that were issued or guaranteed by fnma  fhlmc or the government national mortgage association gnma 
the bank historically maintains high levels of interest earning deposits as part of its strategy for meeting liquidity requirements and improving interest sensitivity 
the bank is required under federal regulations to maintain a minimum amount of liquid assets that may be invested in specified short term securities and certain other investments 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
the bank generally has maintained a portfolio of liquid assets that exceeds regulatory requirements 
liquidity levels may be increased or decreased depending upon the yields on investment alternatives and upon management s judgment as to the attractiveness of the yields available in relation to other opportunities and its expectation of the yield that will be available in the future  as well as management s projections as to the short term demand for funds to be used in the bank s loan origination and other activities

competition for commercial business remains strong  and management continues to look for opportunities that leverage our strengths  particularly in small business lending 
with the shifts in consumer behavior away from auto related financing activities management has moved its efforts more towards the residential  construction  and commercial real estate markets 
we also look to enhance market share in the credit card and home equity products 
this would continue to add to the diversification of the loan portfolio and help boost growth toward budgeted levels 
in general  credit risk is moderate and slowly increasing 
historically  the principal lending activity of the bank has been the origination  for retention in its portfolio  of fixed rate and  to a much lesser extent  adjustable rate mortgage loans secured by one to four family residential real estate located in its market area 
the bank and its subsidiaries also originate loans secured by multifamily residential and commercial real estate  construction loans  commercial business loans and consumer loans 
even though growth across product lines remains challenging as national and global issues adversely impact our market place we still feel there is a large and very strong market within our local surroundings 
one to four family residential mortgage loans originated for resale in the secondary market are underwritten according to standards that conform to federal national mortgage association fnma or federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc guidelines 
one to four family residential mortgage loans originated and held in portfolio are generally underwritten to conform to secondary market standards but from time to time the bank does originate nonconforming loans if  in the bank s judgment  the borrower does not present an unreasonable risk of default 
the bank and tnmc  its mortgage banking subsidiary  have sold in the secondary market a limited amount of fixed rate residential mortgage loans 
the bank has primarily been a portfolio lender and at any one time the bank holds only a nominal amount of loans that may be sold 
volume for loans secured by one to four family residential properties continues to fluctuate 
year end reflects the increases in loan volume due to the purchase of iga 
volume variations will continue to be seen throughout the current period as we manage the growth of the portfolio 
in addition  a continued low rate environment should provide the ability to remain consistent with past performance 
we continue to closely manage the growth of the portfolio especially in this continued low rate environment 
the bank has adopted a current philosophy to place all originations as saleable in order to have an option for potential sale of these lower rate loans to the secondary market 
risk in this sector remains in the low to moderate range 
overall growth in the commercial real estate portfolio continues 
interest rate reductions will spur activity in this sector in spite of other  less favorable  macro economic factors 
just as with the residential mortgage portfolio  commercial real estate is very interest rate sensitive 
to achieve growth in this portfolio  pricing must be carefully formulated to both attract borrowers and create a reasonable return for the bank 
construction lending continues to provide opportunities 
due to the higher levels of inherent risk in construction lending  these credits are thoroughly evaluated 
opportunities are more evident in this portfolio 
a defensive stance on long term fixed rate pricing is necessary to protect already compressed margins 
volume for home equity loans continues to fluctuate

contacts are generally made on the th day after a payment is due 
in most cases  deficiencies are cured promptly 
if a delinquency extends beyond days  the loan and payment history is carefully reviewed  additional notices are sent to the borrower and efforts are made to collect the loan

non performing assets in  the bank s level of non performing assets increased  or to million compared to an increase of  at december  from million at december  the increase in was primarily due to a new risk rating system implemented in september of that caused certain items to be recategorized 
as a matter of policy  the accrual of loan interest is discontinued if management believes that  after considering economic and business conditions and collection efforts  the borrower s financial condition is such that collection of interest becomes doubtful 
this is normally done when a loan reaches days delinquent 
at this time  all accrued but unpaid interest is reversed out of interest income 
there are occasional exceptions if the loans are well secured and in the process of collection 
the bank did not have any material restructured loans within the meaning of sfas no

any subsequent write down of reo is charged against earnings 
the bank had  and  of property acquired as a result of foreclosure at december  and classified assets as part of the bank s loan review procedures which ultimately result in the establishment of the bank s allowance for loan losses  the bank identifies and classifies its problem assets into three classifications substandard  doubtful and loss 
substandard assets have one or more defined weaknesses and are characterized by the distinct possibility that the bank will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
doubtful assets have the weaknesses of substandard assets with the additional characteristic that the weaknesses make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values questionable  and there is a high possibility of loss 
an asset classified as loss is considered uncollectible and of such little value that continuance as an asset of the bank is not warranted 
the bank charges off that portion of an asset as soon as it is classified as a loss 
exclusive of the bank s  of reo  the bank s classified assets at december  consisted of million of loans classified as substandard  compared to million classified as substandard at december  allowance for loan losses psb has an established process to determine the amount of the allowance for loan losses  which assesses the risks and losses inherent in its portfolio 
this process provides an allowance consisting of an allocated and an unallocated component 
to determine the allocated component of the allowance  psb combines estimates of the reserves needed for loans evaluated on an individual basis with estimates of reserves needed for general pools of loans with similar risk characteristics the methodology for determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan loss should consider both specific loan risk and general economic factors 
the analysis includes all types of loans  with the applied methodology commensurate to the risk assessment for the portfolio and present economic conditions 
the risk rating of the loan portfolio is updated quarterly by management and utilized for an overall assessment of the loan loss reserve adequacy  the results of which are being reported quarterly to the board 
the results of the assessment of the adequacy of the loan loss reserve  utilizing the risk ratings and economic factors  receives the close attention of management on an ongoing basis  in accordance with regulatory standards  changes in lending policies  economic business conditions  past due classified loans  quality of loan review  concentration of credit  and examination input 
it is important to note that an effective internal loan review function is an essential element in satisfactorily implementing the bank s methodology 
it is the objective of the bank s evaluation process to establish the following components of the allowance for loan losses 
a specific allocation for certain identified loans  a general allocation for pools of loans based on risk rating and a general allocation for inherent loan portfolio losses 
management performs current evaluations of its criticized and classified loan portfolios and assigns specific reserves that reflects the current risk to the bank 
as a general rule  special mention assets will have a minimum reserve of  substandard assets will have a minimum reserve of  and doubtful assets will have a minimum reserve of 
due to the fact that most of the bank s problem loans are secured by real estate  management has allocated a majority of the allowance for loan losses to these real estate collateralized loans 
a general reserve allocation is applied for pools of loans based on risk rating for all loans not specifically reserved for as described previously
