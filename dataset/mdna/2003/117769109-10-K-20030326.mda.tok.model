item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for a discussion of our historical operating results 
increased food costs could materially adversely affect our operating results our profitability depends in part on our ability to anticipate and react to changes in food costs 
we rely on sysco corporation  a national food distributor  as the primary distributor of our food 
although we believe that alternative distribution sources are available  any increase in distribution prices or failure to perform by sysco could cause our food costs to increase 
further  various factors beyond our control  including adverse weather conditions and governmental regulation  may affect our food costs 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to anticipate and react to changing food costs by adjusting our purchasing practices and menu prices  and a failure to do so could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
changes in consumer preferences or discretionary consumer spending could negatively impact our results our restaurants feature italian cuisine served primarily in family style portions 
our continued success depends  in part  upon the popularity of this type of italian cuisine and this style of informal dining 
shifts in consumer preferences away from our cuisine or dining style could materially adversely affect our future profitability 
also  our success depends to a significant extent on numerous factors affecting discretionary consumer spending  including economic conditions  disposable consumer income and consumer confidence 
adverse changes in these factors could reduce guest traffic or impose practical limits on pricing  either of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
we may be unable to sustain profitability we intend to expend significant financial and management resources on the development of additional restaurants 
we cannot predict whether we will be able to sustain revenue growth  profitability or positive cash flow in the future 
failure to achieve these objectives may cause our stock price to decline and make it difficult to raise additional capital 
we may be unable to compete with larger  better established competitors the restaurant industry is highly competitive 
due to our limited financial resources and operating history  we may be unable to compete effectively with larger  better established competitors  which have substantially greater financial resources and operating histories than we do 
we will likely face direct competition with these competitors in each of the markets we enter 
see item business competition for a discussion of the competition we face 
we could face potential labor shortages our success depends in part upon our ability to attract  motivate and retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  including restaurant managers  kitchen staff and wait staff  necessary to keep pace with our expansion schedule 
qualified individuals needed to fill these positions are in short supply in certain areas  and the inability to recruit and retain such individuals may delay the planned openings of new restaurants or result in high employee turnover in existing restaurants  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
additionally  competition for qualified employees could require us to pay higher wages to attract sufficient employees  which could result in higher labor costs 
our operations depend on governmental licenses and we may face liability under dram shop statutes our business depends on obtaining and maintaining required food service  health department and liquor licenses for each of our restaurants 
if we fail to hold all necessary licenses  we may be forced to delay or cancel new restaurant openings and close or reduce operations at existing locations 
in addition  our sale of alcoholic beverages subjects us to dram shop statutes in most states 
these statutes allow an injured person to recover damages from an establishment that served alcoholic beverages to an intoxicated person 
if we receive a judgment substantially in excess of our insurance coverage  or if we fail to maintain our insurance coverage  our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows could be materially and adversely affected 
see item business government regulation for a discussion of the regulations we must comply with 
complaints or litigation from guests may materially adversely affect us we are from time to time the subject of complaints or litigation from guests alleging illness  injury or other food quality  health or operational concerns 
adverse publicity resulting from these allegations may materially adversely affect us and our restaurants  regardless of whether the allegations are valid or whether we are held liable 
these claims may divert our financial and management resources that would otherwise be used to benefit the future performance of our operations 
we may be unable to fund our significant future capital needs and we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated we will need substantial capital to finance our expansion plans  which require funds for capital expenditures  pre opening costs and potential initial operating losses related to new restaurant openings 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms 
if adequate funds are not available  we will have to curtail projected growth  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition  operating results or cash flows 
moreover  if we issue additional equity securities  the holdings of existing shareholders may be diluted 
although we expect that borrowings under our credit facility  combined with other resources will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements at least through fiscal  this may not be the case 
we may be required to seek additional capital earlier than anticipated if future actual cash flows from operations fail to meet our expectations  costs and capital expenditures for new restaurant development exceed anticipated amounts  we are unable to obtain sale leaseback financing of certain restaurants  landlord contributions  loans and other incentives are lower than expected  we are required to reduce prices to respond to competitive pressures  we are able to secure a greater number of attractive development sites than currently anticipated  or we are unable to achieve the required bank covenants 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources for a discussion of our historical and anticipated capital needs 
we may suffer from uninsured losses that could have a material adverse effect on our business we have comprehensive insurance  including general liability  fire  extended coverage and employee practices liability coverage 
however  there are certain types of losses that may be uninsurable or that we believe are not economically insurable  such as earthquakes and other natural disasters 
in view of the location of many of our existing and planned restaurants in california and other earthquake prone areas of the united states  our operations are susceptible to damage and disruption caused by earthquakes 
in the event of an earthquake or other natural disaster affecting one or more geographic areas of our operations  we could suffer a loss of the capital invested in  as well as anticipated earnings from  the damaged or destroyed properties 
in addition  we do not currently maintain any insurance coverage for the effects of adverse publicity and any adverse publicity could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
terrorist attacks or acts of war could adversely affect our restaurant sales and operations the september  terrorist attacks on the united stated had a significant negative impact on the portion of our business that is celebratory in nature and adversely affected our restaurant sales and profitability 
with the threats of additional terrorist attacks  the continuing uncertainty created by the war on terrorism  and the impact of the war in iraq  there is a potential for a continued downturn in the economy and a decrease in consumer spending 
these factors  should they continue  could adversely affect our restaurant sales  operations and profitability 
we could face consolidated tax group liability prior to our spin off in late fiscal  we were a member of the consolidated tax group of parasole restaurant holdings  inc under the internal revenue code  as a former member of the consolidated tax group  we could be held liable for unpaid federal tax liabilities  if any  of the consolidated tax group through the end of in the event of nonpayment by parasole restaurant holdings  inc rising insurance costs could negatively affect our profitability insurance costs  including worker s compensation  general liability  health and director and officer insurance  are expected to increase significantly in future periods 
these increases could negatively impact our profitability if we are unable to offset such increases by continuing to improve our operating efficiencies

the calculation of comparable restaurant sales increases decreases includes restaurants open for full calendar months for fiscal years through in fiscal  we changed our method of calculating comparable restaurant sales to restaurants open for a full months 
the fiscal and years were adjusted to provide comparable week or week fiscal years 
vinny t s of boston was acquired by buca  inc on january  comparable restaurant sales and average weekly sales are calculated from that date forward 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general at december   we owned and operated buca di beppo and nine vinny t s of boston restaurants 
our buca di beppo restaurants are full service  primarily dinner only restaurants that offer high quality  immigrant southern italian cuisine served family style in large portions in a fun and energetic atmosphere that parodies the decor and ambiance of post war italian american restaurants 
our vinny t s of boston restaurants serve individual and family style portions for both lunch and dinner 
the vinny t s of boston restaurants are based upon recreations of the neighborhood italian eateries prominent and the neighborhoods of lower manhattan  brooklyn  north end boston and south philadelphia in the s 
since  we have pursued a rapid but disciplined expansion strategy  opening two restaurants in  five in  eight in  in  in each of and  and in in january  we purchased the assets of nine vinny t s of boston restaurants 
we intend to open new buca di beppo restaurants and one new vinny t s of boston restaurant in fiscal through march  we have opened six new buca di beppo restaurants 
of the remaining eight locations  all have leases signed and six are under construction 
in an effort to attract smaller parties at our buca di beppo restaurants  we have continued to promote our buca due menu and introduced a buca dinner for two menu 
the buca due menu offerings  which marry smaller portions of our baked specialties with several of our most popular entr e items  such as chicken with lemon  or eggplant  or chicken or veal parmigiana  are served on our traditional family style platters  allowing groups of two to four diners to enjoy a wider selection of our food each time they visit 
our buca dinner for two menu pairs a salad  two pasta selections  and an entr e item for a complete meal 
compared to the buca di beppo restaurants  the vinny t s of boston restaurants generate higher average unit volumes but lower cash flow as a percentage of sales primarily due to the lower margin lunch sales 
lunch sales  in general  produce higher total product cost  lower liquor mix  higher labor costs and higher direct and occupancy costs  all as a percentage of sales 
our fiscal results compare the combined company results this year with the buca di beppo results only in fiscal due to the different unit level economics  the addition of the vinny t s of boston restaurants alone resulted in a slight increase in average weekly sales  and increases of approximately in each of product  labor and direct and occupancy costs 
we implemented a price increase of approximately at our buca di beppo restaurants on the first day of fiscal and a price increase of approximately at our vinny t s of boston restaurants at the beginning of march the price increases are expected to cause product cost and labor cost at both concepts to decrease slightly as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared with fiscal our restaurant sales are comprised of the sales of food  beverages and retail items 
our calculation of comparable restaurant sales includes restaurants open for full calendar months 
product costs include the costs of food and beverages 
labor costs include direct hourly and management wages  bonuses  taxes and benefits for restaurant employees 
direct and occupancy costs include restaurant supplies  marketing costs  rent  utilities  real estate taxes  repairs and maintenance and other related costs 
depreciation and amortization principally include depreciation on capital expenditures for restaurants 
general and administrative expenses are comprised of expenses associated with all corporate and administrative functions that support existing operations  management and staff salaries  employee benefits  travel  information systems and training and market research 
pre opening costs consist of direct costs related to hiring and training the initial restaurant workforce and certain other direct costs associated with opening new restaurants 
special charges relate primarily to fixed asset impairment charges on restaurants 
interest expense includes the cost of interest expense on debt and interest income includes the interest income on invested assets 
the early extinguishment of debt is related to the write off of deferred loan acquisition costs at the time in which we refinanced our credit facility 
the provision for income taxes represents our estimate of all federal and state income taxes we will have to pay for that period

restaurant sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in restaurant sales was a result of sales from new buca di beppo restaurants and the addition of nine vinny t s of boston restaurants on january  our buca di beppo comparable restaurants sales decreased by in fiscal our vinny t s of boston comparable restaurant sales decreased for the period from january  to the end of fiscal both of these reductions in comparable restaurant sales were entirely due to a reduction in guest counts 
we increased prices approximately at buca di beppo on the first day of fiscal and approximately at vinny t s of boston in march we expect comparable restaurant sales to be negative in the first half of fiscal and flat for the remainder of the year  as compared to the applicable fiscal periods 
product 
product costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal product costs decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales to in fiscal from in fiscal this reduction as a percentage of sales was primarily a result of stronger purchasing contracts for a number of key products  the increased sale of baked specialties and specials that have higher product margins and the price increase implemented at our buca di beppo restaurants in march we expect product costs to decrease as a percentage of sales in fiscal from fiscal due to continued improvements in our purchasing contracts and the price increases at our buca di beppo and vinny t s of boston restaurants 
labor 
labor costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal labor costs increased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal compared to in fiscal a improvement in hourly labor as a percentage of sales was offset by the increase as a percentage of sales of primarily fixed management payroll and benefits costs 
the increase in management payroll and benefit costs as a percentage of sales was due to the decline in average weekly sales and the addition of vinny t s of boston 
vinny t s of boston s labor costs as a percentage of sales are higher than those of buca di beppo because the vinny t s of boston restaurants serve lunch  which has a lower margin than dinner 
we expect labor costs to decrease slightly as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared to fiscal the decrease in labor costs as a percentage of sales are expected due to the price increases at buca di beppo and vinny t s of boston 
direct and occupancy 
direct and occupancy costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal direct and occupancy costs increased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in direct and occupancy costs  which are primarily fixed in nature  as a percentage of sales was directly related to the decline in average weekly sales and a increase in marketing spending 
we anticipate direct and occupancy costs to increase as a percentage of sales in fiscal compared with fiscal the expected increase as a percentage of sales is due to slightly declining average weekly sales and rising insurance costs 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this increase was primarily the result of depreciation recognized on capital expenditures for new restaurants 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal general and administrative expenses increased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in general and administrative costs as a percentage of sales was due to the decline in average weekly sales and  in expenses related to the development of our buca di beppo cookbook 
we expect general and administrative expenses to remain consistent as a percentage of sales from fiscal to fiscal pre opening costs 
pre opening costs decreased by  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal pre opening costs decreased as a percentage of sales to in fiscal from in fiscal the decrease in pre opening costs as a percentage of sales was due to management s efforts to reduce these costs to our model of  per new restaurant opening and to increased sales on a larger base of restaurants 
we expect that pre opening costs will decrease as a percentage of sales in fiscal as we expect to open new buca di beppo restaurants and one vinny t s of boston restaurant on a base of buca di beppo restaurants and nine vinny t s of boston restaurants 
special charges 
special charges declined million to  in fiscal compared to million in fiscal special charges in fiscal related to the write off of lease development costs on unopened restaurants where development was cancelled 
special charges in fiscal related primarily to a million asset impairment charge taken at our lowest sales volume restaurant 
interest income 
interest income decreased by  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the decrease in interest income is related to a lower amount of invested assets during the year and lower interest rates 
we expect that interest income in fiscal will decrease slightly from fiscal interest expense 
interest expense increased  to  in fiscal from  in fiscal the increase in interest expense related to increased borrowings on our term loan and line of credit facilities 
we expect interest expense to increase in fiscal due to increased borrowings on our million term loan and million line of credit facility 
early extinguishment of debt 
early extinguishment of debt charges of  taken in fiscal related to deferred loan acquisition costs on our credit facility that was replaced in october provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes of million in fiscal  which is of pre tax income  represents our estimated tax liability for the year 
our tax rate increased slightly from fiscal primarily due to the reduced impact of the income tax credit we receive for fica taxes paid on reported tips 
we expect that our provision for income taxes will decrease to approximately of pre tax income in fiscal due to improvements in other available tax credits

restaurant sales increased by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was attributable to million of restaurant sales at new restaurants  partially offset by comparable restaurant sales decreases of  and an extra week s worth of sales in fiscal comparable restaurant sales decreased by in fiscal  primarily as a result of a decrease in guest visits of  offset by an approximate price increase in january product 
product costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal product costs decreased as a percentage of restaurant sales to in fiscal from in fiscal this reduction as a percentage of sales was primarily a result of stronger purchasing contracts for a number of key products  management s efforts to reduce costs  especially at newer restaurants  a continued shift in sales to baked specialties and specials that have higher product margins  and the price increase at the beginning of the year 
labor 
labor costs increased by million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal labor costs remained constant as a percentage of sales at in fiscal and an improvement in hourly labor as a percentage of sales was offset by the increase as a percentage of sales of primarily fixed management payroll and benefits costs  which was due to the decline in average weekly sales

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal we expect to continue to generate cash from operating activities in future periods 
we use cash primarily to fund the development and construction of new restaurants 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in january  we purchased nine vinny t s of boston restaurants for approximately million 
we opened buca di beppo restaurants in fiscal compared to new buca di beppo restaurants in each of fiscal and each new buca di beppo or vinny t s of boston leased restaurant is expected to require  on average  a total cash investment of between million and million  excluding pre opening costs expected to be approximately  for a buca di beppo and  for a vinny t s of boston restaurant 
since  we have been building restaurants based upon our prototype designs 
these designs are expected to require between million to million in total cash investment per restaurant 
this investment represents an incremental  increase over the historical cash investment for remodeled restaurants 
in the future  we may refinance any purchases of land or buildings through sale leaseback transactions 
we cannot predict whether this financing will be available when needed or on terms acceptable to us 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal financing activities in fiscal consisted primarily of borrowings on our term loan and line of credit facilities 
the proceeds from our debt borrowings were used primarily to purchase vinny t s of boston  develop new restaurants and for general corporate purposes 
financing activities in fiscal and consisted primarily of the sales of equity securities 
in january  we amended our credit facility to include a million term loan and a million line of credit with the option to borrow an additional million provided we were not in default under the terms of the agreement 
the credit facility was to expire on december  the term loan was required to be paid as follows million in fiscal  million in fiscal  and million in fiscal the credit facility bore interest at the lower of our lenders reference rate plus to or libor plus to  dependent upon our meeting certain financial ratios 
we were required to pay on all unused line of credit funds 
the credit agreement contained covenants that placed restrictions on sales of properties  transactions with affiliates  creation of additional debt  limitations on capital expenditures and other customary covenants 
borrowings under the credit agreement were collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
the credit facility required us to raise an additional million in equity or subordinated debt by march  if we did not raise additional capital by march   our capital expenditures would have been limited to million for fiscal the credit facility was paid off and terminated on october  on october   we closed on a new credit facility comprised of a million term loan and a million line of credit facility with the option to borrow an additional million under the line of credit provided we are not in default under the terms of the loan agreement at the time 
the revised credit facility expires on december  we are required to pay back million annually in principal toward the term loan during fiscal through principal payments are to be made on a quarterly basis 
the credit facility bears interest at the lower of our lenders reference rate plus to or eurodollar rate plus to to as of march   dependent upon our meeting certain financial ratios 
we are required to pay on all unused line of credit funds 
the credit agreement contains covenants that place restrictions on sales of properties  transactions with affiliates  creation of additional debt  limitations on capital expenditures and other customary covenants 
borrowings under the credit agreement are collateralized by substantially all of our assets 
we had million in borrowings under the revised credit facility as of march  our capital requirements  including development costs related to the opening of additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
we expect our capital requirements in fiscal to be approximately million 
we will need substantial capital to finance our expansion plans  which require funds for capital expenditures  pre opening costs and initial operating losses related to new restaurant openings 
the adequacy of available funds and our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  the costs and capital expenditures for new restaurant development and the nature of contributions  loans and other arrangements negotiated with landlords 
although we can make no assurance  we believe that our available cash  cash flows from operations  and our available borrowings will be sufficient to fund our capital requirements through at least to fund future operations  we may need to raise additional capital through public or private equity or debt financing to continue our growth 
in addition  we have and may continue to consider acquiring the operations of other companies 
the sale of additional equity or debt securities could result in additional dilution to our shareholders 
we cannot predict whether additional capital will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
contractual obligations the following table provides aggregate information about our contractual payment obligations and the periods in which payments are due payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt and capital leases operating leases see notes  and to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for details of our contractual obligations 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements include accounts of buca  inc and all of our wholly owned subsidiaries 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related notes 
in preparing these financial statements  we have used our best estimates and judgements of certain amounts included in the financial statements  giving due consideration to materiality 
we do not believe there is a great likelihood that materially different amounts would be reported related to the accounting policy described below 
however  application of this accounting policy involves the exercise of judgment and use of assumptions as to future uncertainties and  as a result  actual results could differ from these estimates 
our significant accounting policies are disclosed in more detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets we review our long lived assets  such as fixed assets and intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value amount of an asset or group of assets may not be recoverable 
we consider a history of consistent and significant operating losses to be a primary indicator of potential asset impairment 
assets are grouped and evaluated for impairment at the lowest level for which there are identifiable cash flows  primarily the individual restaurants 
a restaurant is deemed to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows directly related to the restaurant is less than its carrying amount 
if a restaurant is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the restaurant exceeds its fair value 
fair value is an estimate based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets or the results of valuation techniques such as undiscounted estimated future cash flows as if the decision to continue to use the impaired restaurant was a new investment decision 
impairment of goodwill we assess the recoverability of goodwill that is related to our purchase of vinny t s of boston on an annual basis and whenever events or changes in circumstance indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
we test impairment at the concept level for this goodwill based upon the historical cash flow and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
a concept is deemed to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted future operating cash flows directly related to the concept is less than its carrying amount of fixed assets and goodwill 
if a restaurant is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the concept exceeds its fair value 
fair value is an estimate based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets or the results of valuation techniques such as undiscounted estimated future cash flows as if the decision to continue to use the impaired restaurant was a new investment decision 
self insurance we are self insured for a portion of our current medical  dental  workers compensation and general liability insurance programs 
in estimating our self insurance reserves  we utilize estimates of future losses  based upon our historical loss trends and historical industry data 
these reserves are monitored and adjusted when warranted by changing circumstances 
should a change in claims occur compared to what was estimated  our reserves could be either increased or decreased based upon that data 
any increases or decreases in insurance reserves would be offset by a corresponding increase or decrease in insurance expense 
purchase accounting we account for our acquisitions under the purchase method of accounting and accordingly  the acquired assets and liabilities assumed are recorded at their respective fair values 
the recorded values of assets and liabilities are based on third party estimates and valuations when available 
the remaining values are based on management s judgments and estimates 
our financial position and results from operations may be affected by changes in estimates and judgments 
provision of income taxes we estimate certain components of our provision for income taxes 
the estimates include effective state and local income tax rates  allowable tax credits for items such as fica taxes paid on reported tip income and the work opportunity tax credit  and the tax rate in which deferred taxes are recognized

inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food  labor and utility costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
to date  inflation has not had a material impact on our operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on borrowings under our revolving line of credit that bears interest at the lower of our lender s reference rate plus to or eurodollar rate plus to to as of march  
as of march   we had million outstanding in debt borrowings under our credit facility 
thus  a change in interest rates would cause annual interest expense to increase by we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in our cash and cash equivalents 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by commodity pricing and are  therefore  subject to price volatility caused by weather  production problems  delivery difficulties and other factors that are outside our control 
to control this risk in part  we have fixed price purchase commitments with terms of one year or less for food and supplies from vendors who supply our national food distributor 
in addition  we believe that substantially all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks 
we believe we have the ability to increase menu prices  or vary the menu items offered  if needed  in response to a food product price increase 
to compensate for a hypothetical price increase of for food and beverages  we would need to increase menu prices by an average of  which is only slightly more than our average price increases of approximately in fiscal  and in each of fiscal and fiscal accordingly  we believe that a hypothetical increase in food product costs would not have a material effect on our operating results
