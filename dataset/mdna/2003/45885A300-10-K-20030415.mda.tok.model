internap is a leading provider of ip based connectivity solutions to businesses that need assured network availability for mission critical internet based applications 
customers connected to the internet through one of our service points have their data intelligently routed to and from destinations on the internet using our overlay network  which analyzes the traffic situation on the many networks that comprise the internet and delivers mission critical information and communications fast and reliably 
use of our overlay network usually results in lower instances of data loss and greater quality of service than services offered by conventional internet connectivity providers 
our customers are primarily businesses that desire high performance internet connectivity services in order to run mission critical internet based applications 
due to our high quality of service  we generally price our services at a premium to providers of conventional internet connectivity services 
we expect to remain a premium provider of high quality internet connectivity services and anticipate continuing our pricing policy in the future 
we believe customers will continue to demand the highest quality of service as their internet connectivity needs grow and become even more complex and  as such  will continue to pay a premium for high quality service 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements of internap network services corporation  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  doubtful accounts  investments  intangible assets  long lived assets  income taxes  restructuring costs  long term service contracts  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ materially from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the judgments and estimates used in the preparation of internap s consolidated financial statements 
customer credit risk 
we review the creditworthiness of our customers routinely 
if we determine that collection of service revenues is uncertain  we do not recognize revenue until cash has been collected 
additionally  we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments on accounts receivable 
to establish the size of the allowances against revenue and receivables on the balance sheet  we apply a credit risk rating system that is based on management s best understanding of our customers ability to pay 
our assessment of customers credit worthiness may include consideration of payment history 
the sum of individual customer receivable balances multiplied by the credit rating is the basis for reserves against revenues and receivables 
we also increase our reserve estimates for estimated customer credits 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  or management becomes aware of new information impacting customers credit risk  additional allowances may be required 
as of december  and  the valuation allowances for revenue and receivables were million and million  respectively 
bad debt expense during and was million and million  respectively 
investments 
we account for investments without readily determinable fair values at historical cost  as determined by our initial investment 
the recorded value of cost basis investments is periodically reviewed to determine the propriety of the recorded basis 
when a decline in the value that is judged to be other than temporary has occurred  based on available data  the cost basis is reduced and an investment loss is recorded 
as of december  and we had a cost basis investment with an initial cost of million and a recorded valuation allowance of million resulting in a million net investment balance 
if we should become aware of a decline in the business prospects of the investee  or otherwise believe an impairment of our investment has occurred  we may need to increase our allowance for all or a portion of the remaining million net investment balance 
we account for investments that provide us with the ability to exercise significant influence  but not control  over an investee using the equity method of accounting 
significant influence  but not control  is generally deemed to exist if the company has an ownership interest in the voting stock of the investee of between and  although other factors  such as minority interest protections  are considered in determining whether the equity method of accounting is appropriate 
as of december   we have a single investment that qualifies for equity method accounting  our joint venture with ntt me corporation of japan  known as internap japan 
we record our proportional share of the losses of our investee one month in arrears 
we record our investment in our equity method investee on the consolidated balance sheets as a component of non current investments and our share of the investee s losses as loss on investment on the consolidated statement of operations 

table of contents goodwill 
goodwill was recorded as a result of our acquisition of vpnx 
com  inc the company accounts for its goodwill under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement requires an impairment only approach to accounting for goodwill 
the sfas no 
goodwill impairment model is a two step process 
first  it requires a comparison of the book value of net assets to the fair value of the related operations that have goodwill assigned to them 
if the fair value is determined to be less than book value  a second step is performed to compute the amount of the impairment 
in this process  a fair value for goodwill is estimated  based in part on the fair value of the operations used in the first step  and is compared to its carrying value 
the shortfall of the fair value below carrying value represents the amount of goodwill impairment 
sfas no 
requires goodwill to be tested for impairment annually at the same time every year  and when an event occurs or circumstances change such that it is reasonably possible that impairment may exist 
the company selected august as its annual testing date 
to estimate fair value in the future  for purposes of completing the first step of the sfas no 
analysis  we will use a market based analysis based on the value of our equity  or a discounted cash flow analysis 
the forecasts of future cash flows will be based on the company s best estimate of future revenues  operating costs and general market conditions  and is subject to review and approval by senior management 
both approaches to determining fair value will depend on the company s stock price since market capitalization will impact the discount rate to be applied as well as a market multiple analyses 
changes in the forecast could cause the company to either pass or fail the first step test and could result in the impairment of goodwill 
as of december  and  the recorded value of goodwill was million 
all or a portion of this balance may be impaired in the future subject to impairment analysis described above 
restructuring liability 
when circumstances warrant  we may elect to exit certain business activities or change the manner in which we conduct ongoing operations 
when such a change is made  management will estimate the costs to exit a business or restructure ongoing operations 
the components of the estimates may include estimates and assumptions regarding the timing and costs of future events and activities that represent management s best expectations based on known facts and circumstances at the time of estimation 
management periodically reviews its restructuring estimates and assumptions relative to new information  if any  of which it becomes aware 
should circumstances warrant  management will adjust its previous estimates to reflect what it then believes to be a more accurate representation of expected future costs 
because management s estimates and assumptions regarding restructuring costs include probabilities of future events  such estimates are inherently vulnerable to changes due to unforeseen circumstances  changes in market conditions  regulatory changes  changes in existing business practices and other circumstances that could materially and adversely affect the results of operations 
during and  we recorded restructuring costs of million and million  respectively 
we also reduced our accrued restructuring liability by million and million during and  respectively 
these adjustments represent changes to our original restructuring cost estimates  primarily due to revised expectations about the future cost of exiting certain real estate locations 
a change in our restructuring estimates in a future period  compared to the million restructuring liability at december   would result in a million expense or benefit in the statement of operations during the period in which the change in estimate occurred 
deferred taxes 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
since inception we have recorded a valuation allowance equal to our net deferred tax assets 
although we consider the potential for future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we determine we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 

table of contents network service commitment liability 
we monitor our network service commitments with our network service providers 
when we determine that a service commitment will not be achieved through the ordinary course of business and the service provider is not expected to provide relief from the commitment  management records an expense to the direct costs of network and a liability for the estimated shortfall 
if we are unable to continue increasing our base of customers or if our customer base decreases  we may experience a deterioration of our operating margins 
at december  and our accrued liability for network service commitments with network service providers was million and million  respectively 
restructuring and impairment costs restructuring charge 
during fiscal year  due to the decline and uncertainty of the telecommunications market  we announced two separate restructurings of our business 
under the restructuring programs  management decided to exit certain non strategic real estate lease and license arrangements  consolidate and exit redundant network connections and streamline the operating cost structure 
as part of the restructuring activity  employees were involuntarily terminated 
employee separations occurred in all departments 
the majority of the costs related to the termination of employees in were paid during the total charges include restructuring costs of million 
during fiscal year  we incurred cash restructuring expenditures totaling million and non cash restructuring expenditures of million 
we reduced the original restructuring charge cost estimate by million  primarily as a result of favorable lease obligation settlements  leaving a balance of million as of december  during the first and third quarters of  we further reduced our restructuring charge liability by million and million  respectively 
the first reduction was primarily due to settlements to terminate and restructure certain colocation lease obligations on terms more favorable than our original restructuring estimates 
the second reduction was primarily due to the decision to relocate our corporate headquarters to the previously restructured atlanta  georgia facility 
pursuant to the original restructuring plans  we did not anticipate using the atlanta facility in the future 
however  due to changes in management  corporate direction  and other factors  which could not be foreseen at the time of the original restructuring plans  the atlanta facility was selected as the location for the new corporate headquarters 
restructuring and asset impairment charge 
with the continuing decline and uncertainty of the telecommunications market during  we took additional restructuring actions to align our business with market opportunities 
as a result  we recorded a business restructuring charge and asset impairments of million in the three months ended september  the charges were primarily comprised of real estate obligations related to a decision to relocate the corporate headquarters from seattle  washington to an existing leased facility in atlanta  georgia  net asset write downs related to the departure from the seattle office and costs associated with further personnel reductions 
the restructuring and asset impairment charge of million during was offset by a million adjustment  described above  resulting from the decision to utilize the atlanta facility as our corporate headquarters 
the previously unused space in the atlanta location had been accrued as part of the restructuring liability established during fiscal year included in the million restructuring charge are million of personnel costs related to a reduction in force of approximately employees 
this represents employee severance payments made during we expect that there will be additional restructuring costs in the future as additional payments are made to employees who are subject to deferred compensation arrangements payable at the completion of interim employment agreements 
we expect these costs to total less than million 
additionally  we continue to evaluate the restructuring reserve as plans are being executed  which could result in additional charges or adjustments 
real estate obligations 
both the and restructuring plans require us to abandon certain leased properties not currently in use or that will not be utilized by us in the future 
also included in real estate obligations is the abandonment of certain colocation license obligations 
accordingly  we recorded real estate related restructuring costs of 
table of contents million  net of non cash plan adjustments  which are estimates of losses in excess of estimated sublease revenues or termination fees to be incurred on these real estate obligations over the remaining lease terms expiring through these costs were determined based upon our estimate of anticipated sublease rates and time to sublease the facilities 
if rental rates decrease in these markets or if it takes longer than expected to sublease these properties  the actual loss could exceed this estimate 
network infrastructure obligations 
the changes to our network infrastructure require that we decommission certain network ports we do not currently use and will not use in the future pursuant to the restructuring plan 
these costs have been accrued as components of the restructuring charge because they represent amounts to be incurred under contractual obligations in existence at the time the restructuring plan was initiated 
these contractual obligations will continue in the future with no economic benefit  or they contain penalties that will be incurred if the obligations are cancelled 
asset impairments 
on june   we completed the acquisition of co space  which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
the purchase price was allocated to net tangible assets and identifiable intangible assets and goodwill 
on february   management and the board of directors approved a restructuring plan that included ceasing development of the executed but undeveloped leases and the termination of core colocation development personnel 
consequently  financial projections for the business were lowered and  pursuant to the guidance provided by financial accounting standards board no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of sfas  management completed a cash flow analysis of the colocation assets  including the assets acquired from co space 
the cash flow analysis showed that the estimated cash flows were less than the carrying value of the colocation assets 
accordingly  pursuant to sfas  management estimated the fair value of the colocation assets to be million based upon a discounted future cash flow analysis 
as estimated fair value of the colocation assets was less than their recorded amounts  we recorded an impairment charge of approximately million

we expect to complete the majority of the restructuring activities related to the and restructuring charges during  although certain remaining restructured real estate and network obligations represent long term contractual obligations that extend beyond business combinations on july   we completed our acquisition of vpnx 
com 
the acquisition was recorded using the purchase method of accounting under apb opinion no 
the aggregate purchase price of the acquired company  plus related charges  was approximately million and was comprised of issuance of our common stock  cash  acquisition costs and assumed options to purchase common stock 
we issued approximately million shares of common stock and assumed options to purchase vpnx common stock that were subsequently converted into options to purchase approximately  shares of our common stock to effect the transaction 
results of operations of vpnx have been included in our financial results from the closing date of the acquisition forward 
as a result of the vpnx acquisition  we recorded a total of million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
through december   the goodwill and other intangible assets were amortized to expense over their useful lives  which are estimated to be three years  resulting in an expense of million and million for the years ended december  and respectively 
no amounts were amortized for goodwill during as a result of the adoption on january   of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment on an annual basis  or more frequently if indications of impairment arise 
we also recorded an expense of million related to acquired in process research and development costs for the year ended december  the amount allocated to acquired in process research and development is related to technology acquired from vpnx that was expensed immediately subsequent to the closing of the acquisition since the technology had not completed the preliminary stages of development  had not commenced application development and did not have alternative future uses 
furthermore the technologies associated with the acquired in process research and development did not have a proven market and are sufficiently complex so that the probability of completion of a marketable service or product could not be determined 
the fair value of the acquired in process research and development was determined using the income approach  which estimates the expected cash flows from projects once commercially viable and discounts expected future cash flows to present value 
the percentage of completion for each project was determined based upon time and costs incurred on the project in addition to the relative complexity 
the percentages of completion varied by individual project and ranged from to 
the discount rate of used in the present value calculation was derived from an analysis of weighted average costs of capital  weighted average returns on assets and venture capital rates of returns adjusted for the specific risks associated with the in process research and development expense 
the development of the acquired technologies remains a significant risk as the nature of the efforts to develop the 
table of contents acquired technologies into commercially viable services consists primarily of planning  designing and testing activities necessary to determine that the products can meet customer expectations 
results of operations our revenues are generated primarily from the sale of internet connectivity services at fixed rates or usage based pricing to our customers that desire a ds or faster connection and other ancillary services  such as colocation  content distribution  server management and installation services  virtual private networking services  managed security services  data backup  remote storage and restoration services and video conferencing services 
we also offer t and fractional ds connections at fixed rates 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the service has been provided  the fees for the service rendered are fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
customers are billed on the first day of each month either on a usage or a flat rate basis 
the usage based billing relates to the month prior to the month in which the billing occurs  whereas certain flat rate billings relate to the month in which the billing occurs 
deferred revenues consist of revenues for services to be delivered in the future and consist primarily of advance billings  which are amortized over the respective service period and billings for initial installation of customer network equipment  which are amortized over the estimated life of the customer relationship 
direct cost of network is comprised primarily of the costs for connecting to and accessing internet backbone providers and competitive local exchange providers  costs related to operating and maintaining service points and data centers and costs incurred for providing additional third party services to our customers 
to the extent a service point is located a distance from the respective internet backbone providers  we may incur additional local loop charges on a recurring basis 
customer support costs consist primarily of employee compensation costs for employees engaged in connecting customers to our network  installing customer equipment into service point facilities  and servicing customers through our network operation centers 
in addition  facilities costs associated with the network operations center are included in customer support costs 
product development costs consist principally of compensation and other personnel costs  consultant fees and prototype costs related to the design  development and testing of our proprietary technology  enhancement of our network management software and development of internal systems 
costs associated with internal use software are capitalized when the software enters the application development stage until implementation of the software has been completed 
all other product development costs are expensed as incurred 
sales and marketing costs consist of compensation  commissions and other costs for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and field service support functions  as well as advertising  tradeshows  direct response programs  new service point launch events  management of our web site and other promotional costs 
general and administrative costs consist primarily of compensation and other expenses for executive  finance  human resources and administrative personnel  professional fees and other general corporate costs 
since inception  in connection with the grant of certain stock options to employees  we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million  representing the difference between the fair value of our common stock on the date options were granted and the exercise price 
in connection with our acquisition of vpnx  we recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million related to unvested options we assumed 
these amounts are included as a component of stockholders equity and are being amortized over the vesting period of the individual grants  generally four years  using an accelerated method as described in financial accounting standards board interpretations no 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation in the amount of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
at december   we had a total of  remaining to be amortized over the corresponding vesting periods of the stock options 
the revenue and income potential of our business and market is unproven  and our limited operating history makes it difficult to evaluate its prospects 
we have only been in existence since  and our services are 
table of contents only offered in limited regions 
we have incurred net losses in each quarterly and annual period since our inception  and as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
the following table sets forth  as a percentage of total revenues  selected statement of operations data for the periods indicated year ended december  revenues costs and expenses direct cost of network customer support product development sales and marketing general and administrative depreciation and amortization amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets amortization of deferred stock compensation lease termination expense restructuring costs impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets in process research and development loss on sales and retirements of property and equipment total operating costs and expenses loss from operations other income expense interest income expense  net loss on investment total other income expense net loss years ended december  and revenues 
revenues for the year ended december  increased by to million  up from million for the year ended december  the increase during was primarily driven by increased connectivity service revenues  accounting for of the increase  which reflects a full year of operations at the six service points that were opened during  and an increase in our overall customer base from to  customers across our metropolitan market service points 
revenue for the year ended december  also increased by million compared to due to a reduction in the term of a customer s service contract 
as a result of this reduction in the contractual service period and other factors  we changed the estimated life of the customer relationship over which we recognize deferred revenues from months to months  with months remaining at december  the current balance of deferred revenue attributable to the customer therefore increased to reflect the amortization of the remaining balance over the remaining customer relationship period 
also included is contract termination revenues of million collected from customers that discontinued service during the year 
of the remaining increase  can be attributed primarily to content delivery network services and the remaining can be attributed to colocation data center services  including facilities charges 
we expect that revenues will continue to increase for the fiscal year as compared to the fiscal year and connectivity revenues will remain our primary revenue source 
we expect the composition of future revenue increases will include an increasing percentage of revenue from non connectivity products and services than in the past 
direct cost of network 
direct cost of network for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million in reflects reduced network cost and local access expenses representing of the decrease  resolution of disputes with network vendors representing of the decrease and lower third party colocation and service point facility costs representing an additional of the decrease 
these decreases were offset by a increase in customer local access costs  a increase in colocation costs in our facilities and a increase in costs associated with content delivery network services 
connectivity costs vary dependent on customer demands and pricing variables and are expected to decrease during  even with modest revenue growth  due to the full year impact of pricing improvements negotiated during colocation and other service point facility costs are generally fixed in nature  and we expect these costs to remain stable during content delivery network and other costs associated with reseller arrangements are generally variable in nature and are expected to increase  although to a lesser extent as revenue increases 

table of contents customer support 
customer support costs for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million was primarily driven by decreases in compensation representing of the decrease  facilities representing of the decrease  and decreases in communications  general office  travel and entertainment and other costs representing of the decrease 
customer support costs are primarily related to employee costs 
we expect customer support costs to decrease during due to the full year effect of employee terminations completed during product development 
product development costs for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million reflects reduced compensation expense representing of the decrease  facilities representing of the decrease  outside professional services representing of the decrease and communications and other costs representing of the decrease 
product development costs are primarily related to employee and professional service costs 
we anticipate product development costs in to decrease due to the full year effect of employee terminations completed during sales and marketing 
sales and marketing costs for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  approximately of the million decrease can be attributed to a marketing and advertising campaign in additionally  of the decrease relates to compensation costs as a result of employee terminations completed during sales and marketing expenses in should remain consistent with expenses as a result of more focused and efficient marketing and advertising efforts than those in prior periods 
general and administrative 
general and administrative costs for the year ended december  decreased to million from million for the year ended december  the decrease of million reflects lower facility costs representing of the decrease  lower compensation costs representing of the decrease  decreases in taxes and bad debt expense each representing of the decrease  reduced professional services representing of the decrease lower training  communications  travel and entertainment and other office costs representing of the decrease 
we anticipate general and administrative costs will be lower in as compared to as a result of employee terminations and other cost savings measures taken during depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense for the year ended december  increased to million as compared to million for the year ended december  the increase is attributable to a increase in depreciation and amortization expense relating to network and service point assets  including the deployment of six additional service points during we expect network depreciation and amortization to decrease in as compared to as assets reach the end of their depreciable lives 
the increase in depreciation and amortization related to network assets was partially offset by a decrease in depreciation and amortization related to non network assets 
this decrease was primarily due to retirements and write downs of assets during and we expect depreciation related to these assets to decrease in as compared to overall depreciation and amortization is expected to be generally consistent with levels as network assets that become technologically obsolete or reach the end of their estimated useful lives will be replaced with newer assets 
our current plans do not require the deployment of significant additional capital assets during other income expense 
other income expense consists of interest income  interest and financing expense  investment losses and other non operating expenses 
other income expense for the year ended december  increased to million from other expense of million for the year ended december  this increase was primarily due to losses incurred during on our investments in networks and aventail of million and million  respectively  and the million provision we recorded on a note receivable 
during  our other expense items consisted of million in losses related to our equity method investment and million of interest income expense  which decreased due to lower cash balances and higher levels of debt during as compared to we expect other expenses in to be generally consistent with levels 

table of contents years ended december  and revenues

other income expense consists of interest income  interest and financing expense  investment losses and other non operating expenses 
other income expense  net  decreased to million for the year ended december  from other income of million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to losses incurred on our investments in networks and aventail of million and million  respectively  and the provision we recorded on a note receivable of million 
provision for income taxes we have incurred operating losses from inception through december  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our net deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of our ability to realize those assets in future periods 

table of contents as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  capital loss carryforwards of approximately million and tax credit carryforwards of approximately million 
due to limitations imposed by provisions of the internal revenue code of  as amended  upon certain substantial changes in our ownership  approximately million of the aggregate net operating loss and capital loss carryforwards  and million of the tax credit carryforwards will not be utilized 
loss carryforwards of approximately million are available to reduce future taxable income and expire at various dates beginning in  and the amount that could be utilized annually in the future to offset taxable income will be limited 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow for the years ended december    and net cash used in operating activities

these uses of cash were partially offset by decreases in receivables of million and an increase in accrued restructuring costs of million 
the decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities are a result of our efforts to streamline operations during  resulting in lower monthly operating costs in the final quarter of the accounts receivable decrease is largely a result of improved collections during day s sales outstanding were days at december   and reached days during the first half of  ending at days

also during  pursuant to an investment agreement  we purchased  shares of aventail corporation series d preferred stock at per share for a total cash investment of million 
because aventail is a privately held enterprise for which no active market for its securities exists  the investment is recorded as a cost basis investment 
during the second quarter of  we concluded based on available information  specifically aventail s most recent round of financing  that our investment in aventail had experienced a decline in value that was other than temporary 
as a result during june  we recognized a million loss on investment when we reduced its recorded basis to million  which remains its estimated value as of december  additionally  we entered into a joint marketing agreement with aventail which  among other things  granted us limited exclusive rights to sell aventail s managed extranet service and granted aventail specified rights to sell our services 
in return  we committed to either sell aventail services or pay aventail  or a combination of both  which would result in aventail s receipt of million over a two year period 
the joint marketing agreement expired during and we accrued a liability for the million shortfall as a component of accrued expenses 
during the second quarter of we entered into a note payable to aventail in lieu of immediate payment of the shortfall amount and reclassified the million accrued expense to notes payable

we paid million under capital lease agreements for the year ended december  capital equipment leases have been used since inception to finance the majority of our networking equipment located in our service points other than leasehold improvements related to our colocation facilities 
approximately million of networking equipment has been purchased under capital leases from inception through december   of which we paid million to the lessor under the terms of an amendment to purchase equipment with an original cost of million 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily related to a million issuance of series a convertible preferred stock net of million in issuance costs and million proceeds from the issuance of common stock and the exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities was offset by million in payments on capital leases and million paid on a note payable 
net proceeds from financing activities were primarily used to fund operating losses during and  to a lesser extent  for purchases of property and equipment 
on september   we completed a million private placement of units at a per unit price of per unit and issued an aggregate of  units  with each unit consisting of of a share of series a convertible preferred stock and a warrant to purchase of a share of common stock  resulting in the issuance of  shares of series a convertible preferred stock and  warrants to purchase equivalent shares of common stock at an exercise price of per share  which are exercisable for a period of five years

each share of series a convertible preferred stock is initially convertible into shares of common stock subject to adjustments for certain dilutive events 
each share of series a convertible preferred stock may be converted at any time at the option of the holder 
subject to satisfaction of certain conditions  including the listing of the company s common stock on the nasdaq national market system  shares of series a convertible preferred stock automatically convert to common stock on the earlier of i september   ii at such date that the common stock has traded in excess of for a period of consecutive trading days or  iii upon the affirmative vote of of the outstanding shares of series a convertible preferred stock

upon completion of distribution to holders of series a convertible preferred stock  remaining assets will be distributed ratably between holders of series a convertible preferred stock and holders of common stock until holders of series a convertible preferred stock have received an amount equal to three times the original issue price

accounting for convertible debt and debt issued with stock purchase warrants

on april    shares of our common stock were sold in a public offering at a price of per share 
of these shares  we sold  and  shares were sold by selling stockholders 
we did not receive any of the proceeds from the sale of shares of common stock by the selling stockholders 
our proceeds from the offering were million  net of underwriting discounts and commissions of million 
liquidity we have experienced significant net operating losses since inception 
during fiscal  we incurred net losses of million and used million of cash in our operating activities 
management expects net losses to continue for the foreseeable future 
we have decreased the size of our workforce by employees  or as compared to the number of employees at december   and terminated certain real estate leases and commitments in order to control costs 
our plans indicate our existing cash and investments are adequate to fund our operations in however  our capital requirements depend on several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our services  the ability to expand and retain our customer base and other factors 
if we fail to realize our planned revenues or costs  management believes it has the ability to curtail capital spending and reduce expenses to ensure cash and investments will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements in if however  our cash requirements vary materially from those currently planned  or if we fail to generate sufficient cash flow from the sales of our services  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
we cannot assure you such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
our cash requirements through the end of are primarily to fund operations  restructuring outlays  payments to service capital leases  payments on notes payable and capital expenses 
with a slowdown in the macroeconomic environment during and continuing into  we have been focused on significantly reducing the cost structure of the business while maintaining a continued focus on growing revenue 
during fiscal  we announced two separate restructurings of our business 
under the restructuring programs  management made decisions to exit certain non strategic real estate lease and license arrangements  consolidate and exit redundant network connections and to streamline the operating cost structure 
the total charges include restructuring costs of million and a charge for asset impairment of million 
we completed the majority of our restructuring activities related to the plan during  although certain remaining restructured real estate and network obligations represent long term contractual obligations that extend through with the continuing decline and uncertainty in the telecommunications market  we committed to additional restructuring actions during to align our business with market opportunities 
as a result  we recorded a business restructuring charge and asset impairments of million 
the charges were primarily comprised of real estate obligations related to a decision to relocate our corporate headquarters from seattle  washington to an existing leased facility in atlanta  georgia  net asset write downs related to the departure from the seattle office and costs associated with further personnel reductions 
we expect to complete the restructuring activities related to the plan during based on savings from our and restructuring programs and other forecasted cash savings  we believe our cash should be sufficient to meet our cash requirements in if we fail to realize our planned revenues or costs  management believes it has the ability to curtail capital spending and reduce expenses to ensure cash and investments will be sufficient to meet our cash requirements in however  the cash impact of continuing uncertain market demand and the timing of cost reductions is difficult to project 
our cost reduction initiatives may have unanticipated adverse effects on our business 
a portion of our planned operating cash improvement is expected to come from an increase in revenues and cash collections from customers 
commitments and other obligations 
we have commitments and other obligations that are contractual in nature and will represent a use of cash in the future unless there are modifications to the terms of those agreements 

table of contents the amounts in the table below captioned network commitments primarily represent purchase commitments made to our largest bandwidth vendors and  to a lesser extent  contractual payments to license colocation space used for resale to customers 
our ability to improve cash used in operations in the future would be negatively impacted if we do not grow our business at a rate that would allow us to offset the service commitments with corresponding revenue growth 
the following table summarizes our credit obligations and future contractual commitments in thousands as of december  payment due by period total less than year to years to years after years line of credit notes payable capital lease obligations operating leases commitments network commitments total note that the table above summarizes our most significant contractual commitments but does not represent all uses of cash that will occur in the normal course of business

see financial statements and consolidated balance sheets 
one of our network commitment contracts with an internet backbone service provider  representing million of scheduled minimum payments in and million in  includes a provision allowing us to defer portions of our minimum commitments into future periods in the event we do not meet annual contract minimums credit facilities 
at december   we had a line of credit of million and had drawn all available amounts under the facility 
in october  we entered into a revised loan and security agreement  refinancing the line of credit facility and other equipment notes with the same lender 
under the terms of the new loan and security agreement  the million outstanding under the previous facility was refinanced into a million revolving line of credit and a million equipment note 
availability under the revolver is based on of eligible accounts receivable plus of unrestricted cash and investments 
availability is further restricted by the million outstanding under the term loan until the company achieves a specified minimum debt coverage service level for six consecutive months as defined in the agreement 
the amount available under the revolver at the time of the refinancing and at december  was million and million was drawn under the line at december  the revolving line of credit facility is a month facility expiring during october and bears interest at a rate ranging from prime plus to prime plus per year at december   depending on a certain balance sheet ratio as defined in the agreement 
monthly payments are interest only over the term of the facility 
both the revolving facility and the equipment notes are governed by a common security agreement and are collateralized by substantially all the assets of the company 
the agreement allows the lender to require us to maintain cash and investment accounts with them and allows the lender greater control over our customer deposits  
table of contents as defined in the agreement 
both the revolving credit facility and the term loan also contain financial covenants that require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth as defined in the agreement 
further  the lender has the ability to demand repayment in the event  in its view  there has been a material adverse change in our business 
at december  we were in compliance with the financial covenants 
on march  we entered into an amended loan and security agreement

preferred stock 
as discussed under the description of financing activities  we received net proceeds of million during from the sale of preferred stock 
among other things  the preferred stock purchase agreement establishes restrictions on the amount of new debt that we can incur without specific preferred stockholder approval 
if we should  in the future  decide to obtain additional debt to improve our liquidity  there can be no assurance that preferred stockholder approval could be obtained 
lease facilities 
since our inception  we have financed the purchase of network routing equipment using capital leases 
the present value of our capital lease payments are million at december   with million to be paid during we have fully utilized available funds under our lease facilities 
in june  we amended the terms of our master lease agreement with our primary supplier of networking equipment 
the amended terms of the master lease included a retroactive effective date to march  and extended the payment terms and provided for a deferral of lease payments of the underlying lease schedules for a period of months in exchange for a buy out payment of million in satisfaction of the outstanding lease obligation on schedules totaling million and for the purchase of the equipment leased under the same schedules totaling million 
the terms of our master lease agreement  as amended  include financial covenants that require us to maintain minimum liquidity balances  periodic revenues  ebitda levels and other customary covenants 
should we breach the covenants  experience a change of control represented by a change in of the aggregate ordinary voting power  or the lessor believes we have experienced a material adverse change in our business  the lessor has the ability to demand payment of all amounts due 
as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenants

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain cash and short term deposits at our financial institutions that have daily liquidity 
due to the short term nature of our deposits  they are recorded on the balance sheet at fair value 
we also have a million equity investment in aventail  an early stage  privately held company 
this strategic investment is inherently risky  in part because the market for the products or services being offered or developed by aventail has not been proven and may never materialize 
because of risk associated with this investment  we could lose our entire initial investment in aventail 
furthermore we have invested million in a japan based joint venture with ntt me corporation  internap japan 
this investment is accounted for using the equity method and to date we have recognized million in equity method losses  representing our proportionate share of the aggregate joint venture losses 
furthermore  the joint venture investment is subject to foreign currency exchange rate risk 
in addition  the market for services being offered by internap japan has not been proven and may never materialize 
as of december   our cash equivalents mature within three months and our short term investments generally mature in less than one year 
therefore  as of december   we believe the reported amounts of cash and cash equivalents  investments and lease obligations to be reasonable approximations of fair value and the market risk arising from our holdings to be minimal 
substantially all of our revenues are currently in united states dollars and from customers primarily in the united states 
therefore  we do not believe we currently have any significant direct foreign currency exchange rate risk
