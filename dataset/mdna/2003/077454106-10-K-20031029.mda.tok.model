we are a leading designer  manufacturer and distributor of advanced connectivity products for the global network communication and specialty electronic marketplaces 
network communication encompasses connectivity products for the electronic and optical transmission of data  voice and multimedia over local and wide area networks 
products in this segment include high bandwidth network and interconnect cables  fiber optic cable and passive components  including connectors  wiring racks and panels  and interconnecting hardware for end to end network structured wiring systems  and communication cable products for central office  wireless and other applications 
the specialty electronic segment includes highly engineered wire and cable products  as well as conventional wire and cable products  covering a broad range of specialized applications and niche markets  including commercial aviation and marine  automotive electronics  medical electronics  electronic testing equipment  and industrial applications  including robotics and electronically controlled factory equipment 
also included are cables for automation applications  such as climate control  premise video distribution and sophisticated security and signal systems involving motion detection  electronic card and video surveillance technologies  process control applications  such as remote signaling and electronic monitoring systems  sound applications  such as voice activation  evacuation and other similar systems  and safety applications  such as data transmission cable for advanced fire alarm and safety systems  including cable having improved safety and performance attributes under hazardous conditions 
included in the specialty electronic segment are non cable related manufacturing activities encompassing precision tire casting and sheet metal fabrication which are not material to our business reclassification of shipping and handling costs shipping and handling costs incurred for the delivery of goods to customers were historically classified as either cost of sales or selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  depending on the specific operating unit 
effective august   all shipping and handling costs have been included in cost of sales  and prior year statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation 
results of operations the following table presents selected information from our consolidated statements of operations  expressed as a percentage of net sales year ended july  net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses income from operations net loss income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change year ended july  compared with year ended july  sales for fiscal decreased million  or  to million compared to sales of million for fiscal the favorable impact of currency exchange rates on international revenue represented approximately a increase in fiscal sales  and incremental fiscal sales attributable to a network communication business acquired in fiscal contributed approximately to fiscal sales 
these increases were more than offset by lower sales volumes and decreased selling prices 
network communication segment sales decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  and specialty electronic segment sales declined million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal within the network communication segment  sales of network products declined due to decreases in selling prices and lower demand for structured wiring products  particularly in the us and southeast asia regions 
sales of products for the telecommunication market decreased  as the additional sales of an acquired business in eastern europe helped to offset decreases in sales by our existing businesses of these products in the us and western europe 
the decrease in sales for the specialty electronic segment was primarily due to lower sales of commercial aviation products due to reduced demand from aircraft manufacturers 
sales outside of north america were million for fiscal  an increase of compared to sales of million for fiscal the increase in sales outside of north america was primarily due to the additional sales of an acquired business in europe and the favorable effect of currency translation 
gross profit for fiscal was million compared to million for fiscal  and the gross margin was compared to last year 
the decrease in gross margin was primarily a result of decreases in the selling prices of our network connectivity products for the network communication segment 
sg a decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease in sg a was primarily due to reduced employee costs resulting from our efforts to reduce expenses in response to economic conditions as well as lower sales volume related expenses 
sg a as a percentage of sales decreased to this year compared to for fiscal research and development expenses decreased million to million compared to million in fiscal 
table of contents during fiscal we incurred business restructuring expenses of million million  net of tax associated with the implementation of various cost saving initiatives  including the consolidation of four facilities into other operations  the planned divestiture of our awi cdt operation  and workforce reductions company wide 
the restructuring expenses include severance and other employee termination costs of approximately million  asset impairment charges  net of recoveries  of approximately million  future rent payments under noncancelable operating leases of million  and other costs associated with the facility consolidations of million 
business restructuring expenses of million million  net of tax were incurred in fiscal  including million of severance costs associated with workforce reductions and a million charge associated with property and equipment to be held for sale and other costs incurred in connection with the closing of the company s wireless assembly facility 
approximately million of the fiscal and million of the fiscal restructuring expenses were associated with operations in the network communication segment 
net interest expense decreased million to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal  due both to a lower average interest rate and a lower average balance of outstanding debt 
the company s tax benefit of million in fiscal was a result of the company having pretax profits in relatively higher tax rate jurisdictions and pretax losses in lower tax rate jurisdictions 
tax expense for fiscal was million  and the effective tax rate in fiscal of was higher than the us federal statutory rate primarily due to the unfavorable relative effect of permanent non deductible expenses on lower pretax income  as well as an unfavorable effect due to the geographical mix of taxable earnings 
diluted loss per common share from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change was for fiscal compared to diluted earnings per common share before cumulative effect of accounting changes of for fiscal net loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change was million for fiscal compared to net income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change of million for fiscal the fiscal net loss from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change compared to fiscal net income from continuing operations before cumulative effect of accounting change was primarily due to the effect of the lower sales volume  the lower gross margin and increase in expense related to business restructuring activities 
on october   we sold substantially all of the operating assets of our norcom operating unit  a manufacturer of outside plant and central office cable for the us and canadian marketplaces 
results of the discontinued norcom business are presented as discontinued operations in the accompanying financial statements 
net loss from discontinued operations was million  net of tax benefit of million  for fiscal compared to net loss of million  net of tax benefit of million  for fiscal the fiscal net loss includes a million net of tax loss on the sale 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective august  sfas required that amortization of goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives cease as of august  and that the recorded value of goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets be reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
the implementation of sfas resulted in a non cash goodwill impairment charge of million  net of tax  which was recorded retroactively in fiscal to august  as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
our historical recorded value of goodwill related primarily to our specialty electronic business units  and million  net of tax  of the goodwill impairment charge related to reporting units in this segment 
year ended july  compared with year ended july  sales for fiscal decreased million  or  to million compared to sales of million for fiscal sales attributable to acquisitions  which were primarily in the network communication segment  represented approximately of fiscal sales 
network communication segment sales decreased to million for fiscal compared to sales of million for fiscal the lower sales for this segment were primarily due to the slowdown in both the us and european economies  and in the telecommunication marketplace that began in the second half of our fiscal year 
sales of products for the telecommunication market continue to be affected by very low demand  decreasing from fiscal excluding sales attributable to acquired businesses 
network product sales decreased  primarily due to a decline in sales of the lower performance category cable and a decline in sales of connectivity products 
sales of the higher performance gigabit network cable remained relatively stable from fiscal  with slightly increased volumes and improved product mix offsetting the negative impact of declines in pricing 
specialty electronic segment sales decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the reduction in sales for this segment was primarily due to lower sales of industrial cables  due to lower demand from electronic equipment manufacturers in response to the economic slowdown 
sales outside of north america were million for fiscal  a decrease of compared to sales of million for fiscal the decline in international sales was primarily due to lower sales of network and telecommunication related products in europe  which was partially offset by sales attributable to acquired businesses 
gross profit for fiscal decreased to million compared to million for fiscal the decline in gross profit was due to lower sales volumes  as well as lower gross margins in both business segments 
the reduction in gross profit was partially mitigated by our cost reduction actions during fiscal the decrease in the segment gross margins was primarily due to volume inefficiencies and greater pricing pressure for our products 
volume inefficiencies were due to the absorption of manufacturing expenses over lower production levels  particularly for telecommunication equipment related products 
pricing pressures resulted from the slowdown in both the economy and particularly the telecommunication marketplace 
gross profit for fiscal was also negatively impacted by a million provision for slow moving inventory associated with products for the central office telecommunication marketplace 
the gross margin for fiscal was compared to for fiscal 
table of contents sg a decreased million  or  to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal the decrease in sg a was primarily due to lower sales volume related expenses  reduced employee related costs resulting in part from restructuring activities  and a decrease in bad debt provisions 
the decline in bad debt expense was partially due to the fact that a million bad debt charge was incurred in fiscal related to the bankruptcy of a customer 
the decline in sg a was partially offset by a million fiscal provision for a lawsuit  the worst case exposure for which we estimate at million 
sg a as a percentage of sales increased to this year compared to for fiscal research and development expenses decreased million to million compared to million in fiscal business restructuring expenses of million million  net of tax were incurred in fiscal  including million of severance costs associated with workforce reductions and a million charge associated with property and equipment to be held for sale and other costs incurred in connection with the closing of the company s wireless assembly facility

the effective tax rate for fiscal was compared to for fiscal for fiscal  million of the business restructuring expenses for goodwill impairment and loss on the sale of a business were not deductible for income tax purposes 
excluding the effect of the million non deductible business restructuring expenses  the effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the high effective tax rate in fiscal was primarily due to the unfavorable relative effect of permanent non deductible expenses on lower pretax income  as well as an unfavorable effect due to the geographical mix of taxable earnings 
diluted earnings per common share from continuing operations were for fiscal on net income from continuing operations of million  compared to for fiscal on net income from continuing operations of million 
the lower fiscal net income from continuing operations was primarily due to the effect of the lower sales volume and the lower gross margin percentage 
net loss from discontinued operations was million  or per diluted common share for fiscal compared to net income of million  or per diluted common share for fiscal liquidity and capital resources we generated million  million and million of net cash from operating activities in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fiscal decrease from fiscal was primarily due to less cash being generated through changes in working capital  as well as the lower net income 
the increase in fiscal was primarily due to favorable changes in working capital accounts  which more than offset a decline in net income 
during fiscal operating working capital decreased million 
the decrease in operating working capital was primarily the result of decreases in inventory and accounts receivable of million and million  respectively 
the change in operating working capital excludes changes in cash and current maturities of long term debt 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in fiscal  compared to net cash used for investing activities of million in fiscal and million in fiscal during fiscal  we received million from the sale of assets  primarily related to the sale of the norcom operations  and expended million for capital projects

table of contents in connection with the issuance of the convertible notes  the company repaid all amounts outstanding under its million us credit facility  including amounts outstanding under its million revolving canadian facility  which facility was supported by a letter of credit under the us facility  and reduced the availability under the us facility to million 
the us facility was subsequently terminated on august   except with respect to million of letters of credit that remain outstanding 
the bank issuing the letters of credit remains the sole lender under such facility 
there were no borrowings outstanding under the us facility as of july   other than the million of letters of credit 
our principal sources of liquidity in the short term are cash and cash equivalents and cash flows provided by operations 
we are reviewing the potential implementation of a new credit facility to serve as an additional source of funds 
based on current expectations for our business  management believes that our available cash  cash flow from operations and our ability to secure a new credit facility will provide us with sufficient liquidity to meet our current liquidity needs 
off balance sheet arrangements we have not conducted any transactions or have any obligations or relationships that could be considered off balance sheet arrangements 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following table summarizes our significant contractual obligations as of july  payments due per period total payments due thereafter dollars in thousands long term debt capital leases operating leases total contractual cash obligations in july the company entered into a sublease agreement for one of its facilities

as of july  and  the company also maintained a million bond in connection with workers compensation self insurance in the state of massachusetts 
critical accounting policies we prepare our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
preparation of financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  net sales  and expenses 
we base our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable based on specific circumstances 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to sales rebates and allowances  product returns  bad debts  inventory obsolescence  long lived assets  restructuring  pension and other post retirement benefits  income taxes  and contingencies and litigation  and revise our estimates when changes in events or circumstances indicate that revisions may be necessary 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies require more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
provisions for sales rebates  discounts  allowances  price protection programs and product returns are estimated based on historical experience  contract terms  inventory levels at distributors  and other factors 
a decline in market conditions could result in increased estimates of these amounts  resulting in an incremental reduction of net sales 
allowances for bad debts are estimated based on past collection history and specific risks identified in our outstanding accounts receivable 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
we maintain reserves to reduce the value of inventory based on the lower of cost or market principle 
the net realizable market value of inventory is estimated based on current levels and aging of inventory on hand  forecasted demand  market conditions  and other factors 
changes in these factors  including fluctuations in market conditions  could result in additional inventory write downs 
we evaluate the recoverability of long lived assets on an ongoing basis when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be fully recoverable 
our evaluation of potential impairment is based upon market prices  if available  or assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted cash flows that these assets are expected to generate 
judgment is required in determining the timing of the testing  and in the assumptions regarding estimates of future cash flows  which are subject to significant uncertainty 

table of contents we test goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment at least annually  or when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of any such asset may not be fully recoverable 
potential impairment is identified by comparing the fair value of the asset or  in the case of goodwill  the fair value of the reporting unit  to its carrying value 
the fair value is estimated based upon discounted cash flow analyses 
judgment is required in determining the assumptions regarding estimates of future cash flows  and changes in estimated cash flows could have a significant impact on whether an asset is impaired and the amount of the impairment 
accruals for the costs of restructuring activities are recorded in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
we sponsor defined benefit and postretirement plans for certain of our employees and retirees 
we account for these plans in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  sfas no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postemployment benefits 
accounting for the costs of these plans requires estimation of the cost of the benefits to be provided in the future 
this estimation requires management s judgment about the expected rate of return on plan assets  the discount rate used to determine the obligation  rate of future compensation increases  future health care costs and withdrawal and mortality rates  among other things 
changes in actuarial assumptions could significantly impact the future potential liability and funding requirements of the company s defined benefit and postretirement plans  and differences between our estimates and actual results may significantly affect the cost of our obligations under these plans 
we estimate our tax liability based on current tax laws in the statutory jurisdictions in which we operate 
these estimates include judgments about deferred tax assets and liabilities resulting from temporary differences between assets and liabilities recognized for financial reporting purposes and such amounts recognized for tax purposes 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences  including changes in tax laws  could result in potential significant losses or gains 
additionally we evaluate the need for a reserve on deferred tax assets based on our evaluation of recoverability 
we accrue for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  when it is probable that a liability or loss has been incurred and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
contingencies by their nature relate to uncertainties that require our exercise of judgment both in assessing whether or not a liability or loss has been incurred and estimating the amount of probable loss 
effects of inflation we do not believe that inflation had a significant impact on our results of operations for the periods presented 
on an ongoing basis  the company attempts to minimize any effects of inflation on its operating results by controlling costs of operations and  whenever possible  seeking to ensure that selling prices reflect increases in costs due to inflation 
fluctuation in copper price the cost of copper in inventories  including finished goods  reflects purchases over various periods of time ranging from one to several months for each of the company s operations 
for certain communication cable products  profitability is generally not significantly affected by volatility of copper prices as selling prices are generally adjusted for changes in the market price of copper  however  differences in the timing of selling price adjustments do occur and may impact near term results 
for other products  although selling prices are not generally adjusted to directly reflect changes in copper prices  the relief of copper costs from inventory for those operations having longer inventory cycles may affect profitability from one period to the next following periods of significant movement in the cost of copper 
we do not generally engage in activities to hedge the underlying value of our copper inventory

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  primarily related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and certain commodity prices  which arise from transactions that are entered into in the normal course of business 
we seek to minimize these risks through our normal operating and financing activities and  when considered appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
we do not hold derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
interest rate sensitivity as of july   the company did not have any variable rate debt obligations outstanding 
see note financing arrangements of the notes to consolidated financial statements for components of the company s debt 
foreign currency exchange rates we have operating subsidiaries located in various countries outside of the united states  including canada  germany  the united kingdom  the czech republic  italy  sweden and denmark 
foreign currency exposures may arise from transactions entered into by our subsidiaries that are denominated in currencies other than the functional currency of the subsidiary  as well as from foreign denominated revenue and profit translated into us dollars 
we periodically enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge certain balance sheet exposures against future movements in foreign exchange rates 
our strategy is to negotiate the terms of the derivatives such that they are highly effective  resulting in the change in the fair value of the derivatives largely offsetting the impact of the underlying hedged items 
any resulting gains or losses from hedge ineffectiveness are reflected directly in income see note derivative financial instruments and fair value of financial instruments under part ii  item of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
assuming a hypothetical percent increase in the foreign currency exchange rates as of july  and  and holding all other variables constant  the value of foreign currency forward contracts outstanding would have decreased by million and million as of july  and  respectively 
commodity price risk copper is a primary raw material purchased by us and is purchased from several suppliers 
price terms are generally producers prices at time of shipment 
we do not generally engage in activities to hedge the underlying value of our copper inventory
