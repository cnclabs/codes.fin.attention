overview kronos is a single source provider of human resources  payroll  scheduling  and time and labor solutions 
kronos solutions are designed for a wide range of businesses from single site to large multi site enterprises 
kronos derives revenues from the licensing of its software solutions  sales of its hardware solutions and providing professional services as well as ongoing customer support and maintenance 
although kronos has been successful in continuing to increase annual revenues in all periods presented  management believes that the continued economic environment may result in many customers deferring or reducing their technology purchases in the future 
while management believes the impact on technology purchasing may be temporary  the effect may continue to cause delays or reductions in customer purchases of kronos products and services in the future 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon kronos consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires kronos to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
kronos bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
kronos has identified the following critical accounting policies that affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of kronos accounting policies 
please refer to note a in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further information 
revenue recognition the company licenses software and sells data collection hardware and related ancillary products to end user customers through its direct sales force as well as indirect channel customers  which include adp and other independent resellers 
substantially all of the company s software license revenue is earned from perpetual licenses of off the shelf software requiring no modification or customization 
the software license  data collection hardware and related ancillary product revenues from the company s end user customers and indirect channel customers are generally recognized using the residual method when o persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  which is typically when a non cancelable sales and software license agreement has been signed  o delivery  which is typically fob shipping point  is complete for the software either physically or electronically  data collection hardware and related ancillary products  o the customer s fee is deemed to be fixed or determinable and free of contingencies or significant uncertainties  o collectibility is probable  and o vendor specific objective evidence of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  typically maintenance and professional services 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
substantially all of the company s product revenue is recognized in this manner 
if the company cannot determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in an arrangement  the company will defer revenue until all elements are delivered  services are performed or until fair value can be objectively determined 
as part of an arrangement  end user customers typically purchase maintenance contracts as well as professional services from the company 
maintenance services include telephone and web based support as well as rights to unspecified upgrades and enhancements  when and if the company makes them generally available 
professional services are deemed to be non essential and typically are for implementation planning  loading of software  installation of the data collection hardware  training  building simple interfaces  running test data  and assisting in the development and documentation of pay rules and best practices consulting 
revenues from maintenance services are recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance contract period based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the amount charged when purchased separately  which is typically the contract s renewal rate 
maintenance services are typically stated separately in an arrangement 
the company has classified the allocated fair value of revenues pertaining to the contractual maintenance obligations that exist for the month period subsequent to the balance sheet date as a current liability  and the contractual obligations with a term beyond months as a non current liability 
revenues from time and material maintenance services are recognized as the services are delivered 
revenues from professional services are generally recognized based on vendor specific objective evidence of fair value when o a non cancelable agreement for the services has been signed or a customer s purchase order has been received  and o the professional services have been delivered 
vendor specific objective evidence of fair value is based upon the price charged when these services are sold separately and are typically an hourly rate for professional services and a per class rate for training 
based upon the company s experience in completing product implementations  it has determined that these services are typically delivered within a month period subsequent to the contract signing and therefore classifies deferred professional services as a current liability 
the company s arrangements with its end user customers and indirect channel customers do not include any rights of return or price protection  nor do arrangements with indirect channel customers include any acceptance provisions 
generally  the company s arrangements with end user customers also do not include any acceptance provisions 
however  if an arrangement does include acceptance provisions  they typically are based on the company s standard acceptance provision 
the company s standard acceptance provision provides the end user customer with a right to a refund if the arrangement is terminated because the product did not meet kronos published specifications 
generally  the company determines that these acceptance provisions are not substantive and therefore should be accounted for as a warranty in accordance with sfas no 
at the time the company enters into an arrangement  the company assesses the probability of collection of the fee and the terms granted to the customer 
for end user customers  the company s typical payment terms include a deposit and subsequent payments  based on specific due dates  such that all payments for the software license  data collection hardware and related ancillary products  as well as services included in the original arrangement are ordinarily due within one year of contract signing 
the company s payment terms for its indirect channel customers are less than days and typically due within days of invoice date 
if the payment terms for the arrangement are considered extended or if the arrangement includes a substantive acceptance provision  the company defers revenue not meeting the criterion for recognition under sop and classifies this revenue as deferred revenue  including deferred product revenue 
this revenue is recognized  assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied  when the payment of the arrangement fee becomes due and or when the uncertainty regarding acceptance is resolved as generally evidenced by written acceptance or payment of the arrangement fee 
the company reports the allocated fair value of revenues related to the product element of arrangements as a current liability because of the expectation that these revenues will be recognized within months of the balance sheet date 
since fiscal  the company has had a standard practice of providing creditworthy end user customers the option of financing arrangements beyond one year 
these arrangements  which encompass separate fees for software license  data collection hardware and ancillary products  maintenance and support contracts and professional services  are evidenced by distinct standard sales  license and maintenance agreements and typically require equal monthly payments 
the term of these arrangements typically range between and months 
at the time the company enters into an arrangement  the company assesses the probability of collection and whether the arrangement fee is fixed or determinable 
the company considers its history of collection without concessions as well as whether each new transaction involves similar customers  products and arrangement economics to ensure that the history developed under previous arrangements remains relevant to current arrangements 
if the fee is not determined to be collectible  fixed or determinable  the company will initially defer the revenue and recognize when collection becomes probable  which typically is when payment is due assuming all other conditions for revenue recognition have been satisfied 
allowance for doubtful accounts and sales returns allowance kronos maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
this allowance is based on estimates made by kronos after consideration of factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging and bad debt history 
if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances and bad debt expense may be required 
in addition  kronos maintains a sales returns allowance to reflect estimated losses for sales returns and adjustments 
sales returns and adjustments are generally due to incorrect ordering of product  general customer satisfaction issues or incorrect billing 
this allowance is established by kronos using estimates based on historical experience 
if kronos experiences an increase in sales returns and adjustments  additional allowances and charges against revenue may be required 
valuation of intangible assets and goodwill in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  kronos must make assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  kronos may be required to record impairment charges against these assets in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined 
for intangible assets  this evaluation includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over their estimated useful lives  kronos will record an impairment charge in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds their fair value 
for goodwill  the impairment evaluation includes a comparison of the carrying value of the reporting unit which houses goodwill to that reporting unit s fair value 
kronos has only one reporting unit 
the fair value of the reporting unit is based upon the net present value of future cash flows  including a terminal value calculation 
if the reporting unit s estimated fair value exceeds the reporting unit s carrying value  no impairment of goodwill exists 
if the fair value of the reporting unit does not exceed its carrying value  then further analysis would be required to determine the amount of the impairment  if any 
if kronos determines that there is an impairment in either an intangible asset  or goodwill  kronos may be required to record an impairment charge in the reporting period in which the impairment is determined  which may have a negative impact on earnings 
during the three month period ended september   the company completed its annual testing of the impairment of goodwill  as of june  as a result of the test  the company has concluded that no impairment of goodwill existed as of june  therefore  as a result of this impairment test  no impairment was recorded in fiscal capitalization of software development costs costs incurred in the research  design and development of software for sale to others are charged to expense until technological feasibility is established 
thereafter  software development costs are capitalized and amortized to product cost of sales on a straight line basis over the lesser of three years or the estimated economic lives of the respective products 
costs incurred in the development of software for internal use are charged to expense until it becomes probable that future economic benefits will be realized 
thereafter  certain costs are capitalized and amortized to operating expense on a straight line basis over the lesser of three years or the estimated economic life of the software 
income taxes kronos accounts for income taxes under the liability method 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between financial reporting and tax basis of assets and liabilities and are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that will be in effect when the differences are expected to reverse 
kronos records a valuation allowance in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount of future tax benefit that is more likely than not to be realized 
while kronos has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  there is no assurance that the valuation allowance will not need to be increased to cover additional deferred tax assets that may not be realizable 
any increase in the valuation allowance could have a material adverse impact on kronos income tax provision and net income in the period in which such determination is made 
results of operations revenues 
revenues amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
annual revenue growth amounted to in fiscal and  and in fiscal revenues from core business business generated from customers that have not been part of an acquired business transaction over the preceding four fiscal quarters accounted for of kronos revenue growth in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the principal factors driving revenue growth were increased demand for kronos products from new customers  including increased customer demand for the newest data collection hardware  as well as software capacity upgrades and platform conversions  continued demand for kronos professional and maintenance services from new and existing customers  and revenues attributable to acquisitions of businesses over the last four fiscal quarters 
revenues attributable to acquisitions of businesses over the last four fiscal quarters accounted for of kronos revenue growth in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the revenue growth experienced in fiscal was attributable to the effect of incremental revenues derived from customers obtained from acquisitions of businesses over the preceding four quarters and core business growth resulting from increased demand for kronos services 
management presently anticipates that revenue growth will range between for fiscal product revenues amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
product revenues increased in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the principal factors driving product revenue growth in fiscal were increased demand for kronos products from new and existing customers  including demand for the newest data collection hardware  as well as software capacity upgrades and platform conversions 
although product revenues increased during fiscal as compared to the prior year  management believes that the continued economic environment may result in customers deferring or reducing their technology purchases 
while management believes the impact on technology purchasing may be temporary  the effect may cause delays or reductions in customer purchases of kronos products and services in the future 
the product revenue growth during fiscal was attributable to revenues related to the conversion to kronos products by  and add on sales to  customers acquired from other providers of labor management solutions 
product revenue derived from acquired customers was million during fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal  respectively 
maintenance revenues amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
maintenance revenues increased in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
maintenance revenue from core business accounted for of kronos maintenance revenue growth in fiscal as compared to and of kronos maintenance revenue growth in fiscal and  respectively 
maintenance revenue growth attributable to acquisitions of businesses over the preceeding four quarters was in fiscal  as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the principal increase in maintenance revenues in all periods was the result of expansion of the installed base  an increase in the value of maintenance contracts  and incremental maintenance revenues attributable to customers obtained from the acquisition of businesses 
the increase in the value of the maintenance contracts was principally attributable to the platform upgrade of existing customers to kronos new products 
platform and capacity upgrade sales typically result in an increased value of maintenance contracts 
in fiscal  maintenance revenue growth also benefited from an improvement in the billing process which appropriately captures the effective date of contract reinstatements 
professional services revenues amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
professional services revenues increased in fiscal  as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
professional services revenue from core business accounted for of kronos professional services revenue growth in fiscal as compared to and of kronos professional services revenue growth in fiscal and  respectively 
professional services revenue growth attributable to acquisitions of businesses over the preceeding four quarters was in fiscal and and in fiscal and  respectively 
the growth in professional services revenues in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in demand for professional services accompanying sales to new customers  and an increase in the level of professional services accompanying new and platform conversion sales 
the growth in core business professional service revenues in fiscal and was attributable to an increase in the level of professional services accompanying new and platform conversion sales  an increase in the level of follow on services sold to the installed base  and an increase in delivery of professional services resulting from improving the efficiency of kronos services organization 
deferred maintenance revenues increased from september  current deferred maintenance revenues increased and long term deferred maintenance revenues decreased from september  maintenance revenues have grown at a faster rate than deferred maintenance primarily due to the positive impact on the improvement in the billing process which appropriately captures the effective date of contract reinstatements  as well as the effect of the expiration of multi year maintenance contracts sold in previous fiscal years 
as the multi year maintenance contracts approach the end of their term  the revenue will remain constant  however  the deferred maintenance revenue balance continues to decrease 
the decrease in the long term portion was due to kronos decision to curtail the practice of selling multi year maintenance contracts 
professional services revenues increased in fiscal  which approximates the growth in deferred professional services revenues from september  international revenues  which include revenues from kronos international subsidiaries and sales to independent international resellers  amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
international revenues grew by in fiscal and in fiscal and international revenues amounted to  and of total revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
the growth in international revenues in fiscal was primarily attributable to the timing of several large customer orders which were executed during fiscal kronos does not believe that the revenue growth experienced in fiscal is indicative of future results and expects the future year s revenue growth to be more consistent with that experienced in fiscal and gross profit 
gross profit as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decline in gross profit in fiscal is primarily attributable to a higher proportion of service revenues  which typically carries a lower gross profit and a decline in service gross profit as compared to fiscal product gross profit as a percentage of product revenues was in fiscal and  as compared to in fiscal although hardware revenues  which typically carry a lower gross profit than software revenues  were a greater proportion of total product revenues in fiscal than fiscal  the negative impact on product margin was offset by a decrease in sales of third party product for resale  which typically carry the lowest product gross profit 
the decrease in product gross profit in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  is primarily related to higher production costs attributable to the kronos tm terminal and related modules 
this decrease was partially offset by a higher proportion of software sales  which typically carry a higher gross profit than hardware sales 
service gross profit as a percentage of professional service and maintenance revenues was in fiscal as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in service gross profit in fiscal was primarily attributable to increased spending in support of kronos human resources and payroll product rollout  partially offset by growth in maintenance revenues and further leveraging of the existing support organization to support the increasing customer base 
the improvement in gross profit in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily attributable to increased productivity in the service organization  which was the result of leveraging investments in service systems to more effectively manage the resources required to deliver professional services and customer support 
net operating expenses 
net operating expenses for fiscal increased million  or  to million as compared to an increase of million  or  to million in fiscal the increase in actual spending in fiscal was primarily attributable to investments in personnel and related compensation and support costs in response to increased customer demand and to support the development of new products  as well as increased spending for outside consultants and professional fees 
net operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were in fiscal  as compared to and in fiscal and  respectively 
the decrease in net operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal was primarily attributable to the leveraging of investments in infrastructure to generate higher sales volumes  and continued corporate wide efforts to contain costs 
the decrease in net operating expenses as a percentage of revenues in fiscal was primarily due to the special charges recorded in the second and third quarters of fiscal and the elimination of goodwill amortization due to kronos adoption of statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective october  on a proforma basis  excluding the special charge and amortization expense  net operating expenses as a percentage of revenues were in fiscal although management intends to decrease operating expenses as a percentage of revenues during fiscal  principally through continued productivity improvements  uncertainty related to the current economic climate and its impact on the timing of customers purchases  as well as increased investments in productivity programs and infrastructure to support the anticipated increase in sales volume  may prevent decreases in operating expenses as a percentage of revenues from being realized 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal increased million  or  as compared to an increase of million  or in fiscal the increase in actual spending in fiscal was primarily attributable to kronos investment in sales personnel and related compensation and support costs to add new customers and to maximize the penetration of existing accounts  additional spending on programs related to the expansion of market awareness of kronos products and services  as well as additional spending for personnel training 
the increase in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal and was attributable to kronos investments in sales personnel and related support costs  as well as  to a lesser extent  the impact of converting kronos reseller operations to direct sales operations 
as a percentage of revenues  sales and marketing expenses were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in sales and marketing spending as a percentage of total revenues in fiscal and was primarily attributable to leveraging the investments in infrastructure to generate higher sales volumes 
these infrastructure investments include investments in information systems as well as investments in training programs 
engineering  research and development expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
engineering  research and development expenses increased million  or  as compared to an increase of million  or  in fiscal the increase in actual spending in fiscal was principally attributable to an increase in compensation related expenses  expenses associated with the introduction of the new human resources and payroll products  as well as an increase in training expenses  partially offset by the reallocation of certain engineering resources focused upon information systems support to general and administrative expenses 
the increase in spending in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in salary related expenses  partially offset by a reduction in spending related to contract consultants 
as a percentage of revenues  engineering  research and development expenses were in fiscal as compared to in both fiscal and the decrease as a percentage of revenues in fiscal  as compared to fiscal  was primarily due to higher sales volume in fiscal these expenses are net of capitalized software development costs of million  million and million  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the significant project development efforts in fiscal principally related to further development and enhancement of the workforce central r suite  workforce hr tm  workforce payroll tm  and the kronos terminal 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
general and administrative expenses increased million  or  in fiscal  as compared to an increase of million  or in fiscal general and administrative expenses primarily consist of personnel and overhead related expenses for administrative  information technology  finance  legal  and human resources support functions 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal was primarily due to kronos investment in personnel and related compensation and support costs including those costs associated with the previously discussed reallocation of engineering resources to general and administrative expenses  an increase in fees related to tax planning and other professional services  and continued investment in infrastructure to support the growth of operations 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in fiscal is primarily due to kronos investment in personnel and other infrastructure to support the growth of operations 
as a percentage of revenues  general and administrative expenses were in fiscal as compared to in fiscal and amortization of intangible assets as a percentage of revenues were in fiscal and  as compared to in fiscal the decrease in amortization in fiscal as compared to fiscal was the result of the elimination of goodwill amortization described in this annual report and or form k 
other income  net as a percentage of revenues was in fiscal and  as compared to in fiscal other income  net is principally interest income earned from kronos cash as well as investments in its marketable securities and financing arrangements 
special charge fiscal a special charge in the amount of million was recorded in fiscal approximately million of the special charge was recorded in the second quarter of fiscal related to the termination of kronos crosswinds technology operations 
the crosswinds technology group  which was purchased in may  was responsible for the product development  marketing and sales support of time and attendance applications that operated as a microsoft outlook plug in product 
lower than anticipated sales of these applications  redundant infrastructure and ongoing operating losses resulted in the termination of the standalone operating unit 
the million charge consisted of million in termination costs  million for the write off of intangible assets and million in other costs 
approximately million of the special charge was recorded in the third quarter of fiscal related to termination costs from a reduction in workforce of approximately employees 
this charge was the result of management s effort to streamline operations to better align costs with expected revenues 
as of september   kronos did not have any remaining liability related to the special charge 
income taxes 
the provision for income taxes as a percentage of pre tax income was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal kronos effective income tax rate may fluctuate between periods as a result of various factors  including income tax credits  foreign tax rate differentials and state income taxes 
management currently anticipates that the income tax rate will decline in fiscal as kronos implements certain tax management strategies 
newly issued accounting standards 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
the statement amends the disclosure requirements of fasb statement no 
to require prominent disclosure in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
kronos accounts for stock based compensation arrangements in accordance with the provisions of accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and complies with the disclosure provisions of fasb statement no 
the transition provisions are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the disclosure provisions are effective for interim periods beginning after december  kronos implemented the required disclosure provisions in the three month period ended march  the adoption of this statement did not have any impact on kronos consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows and kronos does not anticipate making the voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin no 
requires certain variable interest entities  or vies  to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin no 
is effective for all vies created or acquired after january  in october  the fasb issued fin no 
 effective date of fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
this fasb staff position deferred the effective date for applying the provisions of fin no 
for interests held by public entities in variable interest entities or potential variable interest entities created before february  a public entity need not apply the provisions of fin no 
to an interest held in a variable interest entity or potential variable interest entity until the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  if both of the following apply o the variable interest entity was created before february  o the public entity has not issued financial statements reporting interests in variable interest entities in accordance with fin no 
 other than certain required disclosures 
kronos currently has no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and therefore the adoption of fin no 
will not have a material effect on kronos consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
liquidity and capital resources kronos funds its business through cash generated by operations 
if near term demand for kronos products weakens or if significant anticipated sales in any quarter do not close when expected  the availability of such funds may be adversely impacted 
kronos believes that it has more than adequate financing to sustain its operations through the next fiscal year 
cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities which includes both short and long term securities amounted to million as of september  and million as of september  this increase in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities is due to cash generated from operations 
working capital as of september  amounted to million as compared with million at september  this increase in working capital is primarily due to an increase in cash resulting from cash provided by operations 
cash provided by operations amounted to million in fiscal as compared to million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
the increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal is principally attributable to higher net income  an increase in accruals related to taxes and compensation expenses due to the timing of payments  as well as increased non cash charges that are added back in the calculation of cash flow from operations 
these are partially offset by an increase in accounts receivable due to higher sales volume 
the increase in cash provided by operations in fiscal is principally attributable to an increase in net income  collection of accounts receivable from trade customers and the tax benefit from the exercise of stock options 
these are partially offset by a reduced rate of increase in kronos deferred revenues as well as an increase in cash used due to timing of compensation related payments 
cash used for property  plant and equipment was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal kronos use of cash for property  plant and equipment in all periods presented includes investments in information system and infrastructure to improve and support expanding operations 
kronos use of cash for the acquisition of businesses and software in all periods presented was principally related to the acquisitions of specified assets and or businesses of kronos resellers and or other providers of labor management solutions 
in addition  during fiscal  kronos use of cash for the acquisition of businesses and software included cash used for the acquisition of the source code license for the abra enterprise human resources and payroll software 
kronos is assessing several acquisition opportunities that may be completed over the next twelve months  although there can be no assurance that these acquisitions will be completed 
management anticipates making significant capital investments during fiscal in conjunction with the replacement of information technology systems 
these investments could approximate up to of total revenues in fiscal excess cash reserves not required for operations  investments in property  plant and equipment or acquisitions are invested in marketable securities 
net investments in marketable securities increased by million in fiscal compared to an increase of million in fiscal and an increase of million in fiscal under kronos stock repurchase program  kronos repurchased  shares of common stock in fiscal at a cost of million  compared to  shares of common stock at a cost of million in fiscal and  shares of common stock at a cost of million in fiscal the common stock repurchased under the program is used for kronos employee stock option plans and employee stock purchase plan 
during the first quarter of fiscal  kronos received million upon the maturity of a call option arrangement 
as of september   kronos did not have any outstanding call option arrangements 
please refer to note a in the notes to condensed consolidated financial statements for further details regarding call option arrangements 
cash provided by operations was sufficient to fund investments in capitalized software development costs  property  plant and equipment and stock repurchases 
kronos leases certain office space  manufacturing facilities and equipment under long term operating lease agreements 
in addition  certain acquisition agreements contain provisions that require kronos to make a guaranteed payment and or contingent payments based upon profitability of the business unit or if specified minimum revenue requirements are met 
future minimum rental commitments under operating leases with non cancelable terms of one year or more  and future payment obligations related to guaranteed payments are as follows in thousands payments due by period more than more than year  year  less than less than less than more than contractual obligations total year years years years operating lease obligations 
     guaranteed payment obligations    total      kronos believes that with cash generated from ongoing operations it has adequate cash and investments and operating cash flow to fund its investments in property  plant and equipment  software development costs  cash requirements under operating leases  cash payments related to acquisitions  if any  and any additional stock repurchases for the foreseeable future 
certain factors that may affect future operating results except for historical matters  the matters discussed in this annual report and or form k are forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of the act 
kronos desires to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the act and is including this statement for the express purpose of availing itself of the protection of the safe harbor with respect to all forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
kronos actual operating results may differ from those indicated by forward looking statements made in this annual report and or form k and presented elsewhere by management from time to time because of a number of factors including the potential fluctuations in quarterly results  timing and acceptance of new product introductions by kronos and its competitors  the dependence on kronos time and labor product line  the ability to attract and retain sufficient technical personnel  the protection of kronos intellectual property and the potential infringement on kronos intellectual property rights  competitive pricing pressure  and the dependence on alternate distribution channels and on key vendors  as further described below 
potential fluctuations in results 
kronos operating results  including revenue growth  sources of revenue  effective tax rate and liquidity  may fluctuate as a result of a variety of factors  including the purchasing patterns of its customers  mix of products and services sold  the ability of kronos to effectively integrate acquired businesses into kronos operations  the timing of the introduction of new products and product enhancements by kronos and its competitors  the strategy employed by kronos to enter the human resources and payroll market  market acceptance of new products  competitive pricing pressure and general economic conditions 
kronos historically has realized a relatively larger percentage of its annual revenues and profits in the third and fourth quarters and a relatively smaller percentage in the first and second quarters of each fiscal year  although there can be no assurance that this pattern will continue 
in addition  substantially all of kronos product revenue and profits in each quarter result from orders received in that quarter 
if near term demand for kronos products weakens or if significant anticipated sales in any quarter do not close when expected  kronos revenues for that quarter will be adversely affected 
kronos believes that its operating results for any one period are not necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
competition 
the employee relationship management erm market  which includes time and labor  scheduling  human resources and payroll  is highly competitive 
technological changes such as those allowing for increased use of the internet have resulted in new entrants into the market 
increased competition could adversely affect kronos operating results through price reductions and or loss of market share 
with kronos efforts to expand its labor management offering with the recent introduction of its human resources and payroll product suite  kronos will continue to meet strong competition 
many of these competitors may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their human resources and payroll products 
many of kronos human resources and payroll competitors have significantly greater financial  technical and sales and marketing resources than kronos  as well as more experience in delivering human resources and payroll solutions 
although kronos believes it has core competencies that position it strongly in the marketplace  maintaining kronos technological and other advantages over competitors will require continued investment by kronos in research and development and marketing and sales programs 
there can be no assurance that kronos will have sufficient resources to make such investments or be able to achieve the technological advances necessary to maintain its competitive advantages 
there can be no assurance that kronos will be able to compete successfully in the human resources and payroll marketplace  and its failure to do so could have a material adverse impact upon its business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
dependence on time and labor product line 
to date  more than of kronos revenues have been attributable to sales of labor management systems and related services 
although kronos has introduced products for the licensed human resources and payroll market during fiscal  kronos expects that its dependence on the time and labor product line for revenues will continue for the foreseeable future 
competitive pressures or other factors could cause kronos time and labor products to lose market acceptance or experience significant price erosion  adversely affecting the results of kronos operations 
product development and technological change 
continual change and improvement in computer software and hardware technology characterize the markets for erm systems 
kronos future success will depend largely on its ability to enhance the capabilities and increase the performance of its existing products and to develop new products and interfaces to third party products on a timely basis to meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of its customers 
although kronos is continually seeking to further enhance its erm offerings and to develop new products and interfaces  there can be no assurance that these efforts will succeed  or that  if successful  such product enhancements or new products will achieve widespread market acceptance  or that kronos competitors will not develop and market products which are superior to kronos products or achieve greater market acceptance 
dependence on alternate distribution channels 
kronos markets and sells its products through its direct sales organization  independent resellers and adp under an oem agreement 
in fiscal  approximately of kronos revenue was generated through sales to resellers and adp 
management does not anticipate that its entrance into the human resources and payroll market will have a negative impact on its relationship with adp 
during fiscal  kronos and adp signed an agreement extending their business relationship for an additional term of five years 
however  a reduction in the sales efforts of either kronos major resellers or adp  or termination or changes in their relationships with kronos  could have a material adverse effect on the results of kronos operations 
attracting and retaining sufficient technical personnel for product development  support and sales 
kronos has encountered intense competition for experienced technical personnel for product development  technical support and sales and expects such competition to continue in the future 
any inability to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified technical personnel could adversely affect kronos ability to produce  support and sell products in a timely manner 
protection of intellectual property 
kronos has developed  and through its acquisitions of businesses and software  acquired proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
kronos success is dependent upon its ability to further develop and protect its proprietary technology and intellectual property rights 
kronos seeks to protect products  software  documentation and other written materials primarily through a combination of trade secret  patent  trademark and copyright laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
while kronos has attempted to safeguard and maintain its proprietary rights  it is unknown whether kronos has been or will be successful in doing so 
despite kronos efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of its products or obtain and use information that is regarded as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of kronos products is difficult 
while kronos is unable to determine the extent to which piracy of its software products exists  software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
kronos can offer no assurance that it can adequately protect its proprietary rights or that its competitors will not reverse engineer or independently develop similar technology 
infringement of intellectual property rights 
kronos cannot provide assurance that others will not claim that kronos developed or acquired intellectual property rights infringe on their intellectual property rights or that kronos does not in fact infringe on those intellectual property rights 
any litigation regarding intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming and divert the attention of kronos management and key personnel from business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require kronos to enter into costly royalty or license agreements  and in this event  kronos may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on acceptable terms  if at all 
kronos may also be subject to significant damages or an injunction against the use of its products 
a successful claim of patent or other intellectual property infringement against kronos could cause immediate and substantial damage to its business and financial condition
