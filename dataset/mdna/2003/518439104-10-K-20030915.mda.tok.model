item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses reported in those financial statements 
these judgments can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results could differ from those estimates 
our most critical accounting policies relate to revenue recognition  concentration of credit risk  inventory  pension and other postretirement benefit costs  goodwill and other intangible assets  income taxes  and derivatives 
revenue recognition generally  revenues from merchandise sales are recorded at the time the product is shipped to the customer 
we report our sales levels on a net sales basis  which is computed by deducting from gross sales the amount of actual returns received and an amount established for anticipated returns 
as is customary in the cosmetics industry  our practice is to accept returns of our products from retailers if properly requested  authorized and approved 
in accepting returns  we typically provide a credit to the retailer against sales and accounts receivable from that retailer on a dollar for dollar basis 
our sales return accrual is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net sales 
this accrual is calculated based on a history of gross sales and actual returns by region and product category 
in addition  as necessary  specific accruals may be established for future known or anticipated events 
as a percentage of gross sales  sales returns were  and in fiscal  and  respectively 
concentration of credit risk an entity is more vulnerable to concentrations of credit risk if it is exposed to risk of loss greater than it would have had it mitigated its risk through diversification of customers 
such risks of loss manifest themselves differently  depending on the nature of the concentration  and vary in significance 
we have three major customers that owned and operated retail stores that in the aggregate accounted for approximately billion  or  of our consolidated net sales in fiscal and million  or  of our accounts receivable at june  these customers sell products primarily within north america 
although management believes that these customers are sound and creditworthy  a severe adverse impact on their business operations could have a corresponding material adverse effect on our net sales  cash flows  and or financial condition 
in the ordinary course of business  we have established an allowance for doubtful accounts and customer deductions in the amount of million and million as of june  and  respectively 
our allowance for doubtful accounts is a subjective critical estimate that has a direct impact on reported net earnings 
this reserve is based upon the evaluation of accounts receivable aging  specific exposures and historical trends 
inventory we state our inventory at the lower of cost or fair market value  with cost being determined on the first in  first out fifo method 
we believe fifo most closely matches the flow of our products from manufacture through sale 
the reported net value of our inventory includes saleable products  promotional products  raw materials and componentry that will be sold or used in future periods 
inventory cost includes raw materials  direct labor and overhead 
we also record an inventory obsolescence reserve  which represents the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value  based on various product sales projections 
this reserve is calculated using an estimated obsolescence percentage applied to the inventory based on age  historical trends and requirements to support forecasted sales 
in addition  and as necessary  we may establish specific reserves for future known or anticipated events 
pension and other postretirement benefit costs we offer the following benefits to some or all of our employees a domestic trust based noncontributory defined benefit pension plan us plan  an unfunded  nonqualified domestic noncontributory pension plan to provide benefits in excess of statutory limitations  a contributory defined contribution plan  international pension plans  which vary by country  consisting of both defined benefit and defined contribution pension plans  deferred compensation  and certain other postretirement benefits 
the amounts necessary to fund future payouts under these plans are subject to numerous assumptions and variables 
certain significant variables require us to make assumptions that are within our control such as an anticipated discount rate  expected rate of return on plan assets and future compensation levels 
we evaluate these assumptions with our actuarial advisors and we believe they are within accepted industry ranges  although an increase or decrease in the assumptions or economic events outside our control could have a direct impact on reported net earnings 
the pre retirement discount rate for each plan used for determining future pension obligations is based on a review of highly rated long term bonds 
at june   we used a pre retirement discount rate for our us plan of and varying rates on our international plans of between and 
for fiscal  we used an expected return on plan assets of for our us plan and varying rates of between and for our international plans 
in determining the long term rate of return for a plan  we consider the historical rates of return  the nature of the plan s investments and an expectation for the plan s investment strategies 
the us plan asset allocation as of june  was approximately equity investments  fixed income investments  cash and other investments 
for fiscal  we will use a pre retirement discount rate for the us plan of and anticipate using an expected return on plan assets of 
the change in this assumption from that used in fiscal will cause an increase in pension expense in fiscal we will continue to monitor the market conditions relative to these assumptions and adjust them accordingly 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill is calculated as the excess of the cost of purchased businesses over the value of their underlying net assets 
other intangible assets principally consist of purchased royalty rights and trademarks 
goodwill and other intangible assets that have an indefinite life are not amortized 
on an annual basis  we test goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment 
to determine the fair value of these intangible assets  there are many assumptions and estimates used that directly impact the results of the testing 
we have the ability to influence the outcome and ultimate results based on the assumptions and estimates we choose 
to mitigate undue influence  we use industry accepted valuation models and set criteria that are reviewed and approved by various levels of management 
additionally  we evaluate our recorded goodwill with the assistance of a third party valuation firm 
income taxes we have accounted for  and currently account for  income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
this statement establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effects of income taxes that result from an enterprise s activities during the current and preceding years 
it requires an asset and liability approach for financial accounting and reporting of income taxes 
as of june   we have current net deferred tax assets of million and non current net deferred tax assets of million 
these net deferred tax assets assume sufficient future earnings for their realization  as well as the continued application of current tax rates 
included in net deferred tax assets is a valuation allowance of approximately million for deferred tax assets  which relates to foreign tax loss carryforwards not utilized to date  where management believes it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets will not be realized in the relevant jurisdiction 
based on our assessments  no additional valuation allowance is required 
if we determine that a deferred tax asset will not be realizable  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset will result in a reduction of earnings at that time 
furthermore  we provide tax reserves for federal  state and international exposures relating to audit results  planning initiatives and compliance responsibilities 
the development of these reserves requires judgments about tax issues  potential outcomes and timing  and is a subjective critical estimate 
derivatives we currently account for derivative financial instruments in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities 
this statement also requires the recognition of all derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities on the balance sheet and that they be measured at fair value 
we currently use derivative financial instruments to hedge certain anticipated transactions and interest rates  as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies 
we do not utilize derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
hedge effectiveness is documented  assessed and monitored by our employees who are qualified to make such assessments and monitor the instruments 
variables that are external to us such as social  political and economic risks may have an impact on our hedging program and the results thereof 
results of operations we manufacture  market and sell skin care  makeup  fragrance and hair care products which are distributed in over countries and territories 
the following is a comparative summary of operating results for fiscal  and and reflects the basis of presentation described in note and note to the notes to consolidated financial statements for all periods presented

we have presented these reconciliations because of the special nature of the charges or the fact that they are not necessarily comparable from period to period 
we believe that such measures provide investors with a view of our ongoing business trends and results of operations 
this is consistent with the approach used by management in its evaluation and monitoring of such trends and results and provides investors with a base for evaluating future periods

the amount of the charge in this case is significantly larger than similar charges we have incurred individually or in the aggregate for legal proceedings in any prior year and we do not expect to take a charge of a similar magnitude for a single matter like it in the near future

fiscal as compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased or million to  million  reflecting growth in all product categories and each of our geographic regions 
product category results were led by skin care  and our regions were led by europe  the middle east africa  where results benefited from favorable foreign exchange rates to the us dollar and improvements in the travel retail business 
travel retail improved during the middle of fiscal compared with lower results during the middle of fiscal but was adversely affected during the last quarter of fiscal by certain world events  including the lingering effects of the war in iraq and concerns relating to sars 
such events may affect our future sales and earnings 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales increased 
product categories skin care net sales of skin care products increased or million to  million  which was primarily attributable to the recent launches of perfectionist correcting serum for lines wrinkles and resilience lift overnight face and throat creme by estee lauder  and the repairwear line of products and advanced stop signs from clinique 
additionally  the increase was supported by strong sales of comforting cream cleanser  moisture surge extra thirsty skin relief and moisture surge eye gel  and products in the step skin care system by clinique  as well as by re nutriv ultimate lifting creme from estee lauder  and a perfect world line of products by origins 
partially offsetting this increase were lower net sales of certain existing products such as stop signs  total turnaround cream and turnaround cream by clinique and idealist skin refinisher by estee lauder 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  skin care net sales increased 
makeup makeup net sales increased or million to  million due to strong sales of our makeup artist lines and current year launches of dewy smooth anti aging makeup and colour surge lipstick by clinique  and magnascopic maximum volume mascara and artist s lip and eye pencils from estee lauder 
also contributing to growth were strong sales from estee lauder brand products including so ingenious multi dimension liquid makeup and loose powder  as well as from new and existing products in the pure color line 
offsetting this increase were lower net sales of certain existing products such as sumptuous lipstick from estee lauder  and gentle light makeup and powder and high impact eye shadow duos by clinique 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  makeup net sales increased 
fragrance net sales of fragrance products increased or million to  million  primarily reflecting the effects of favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the us dollar 
the fragrance industry continues to experience a difficult environment 
the travel retail business  which depends substantially on fragrance products  began to improve in the middle of the fiscal year relative to the prior year  however the latter part of fiscal was adversely affected by international uncertainties stemming from events in iraq and concerns relating to sars 
in fiscal  we successfully launched estee lauder pleasures intense  t girl by tommy hilfiger  clinique happy heart  lauder intuition for men and donna karan black cashmere 
net sales also benefited from strong sales of beautiful by estee lauder and aromatics elixir from clinique 
offsetting these increases and sales from new product launches were lower net sales of certain tommy hilfiger products  intuition by estee lauder and estee lauder pleasures 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  fragrance net sales were relatively unchanged from the prior year 
hair care hair care net sales increased or million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble products 
we also increased the number of company owned aveda experience centers and strategically decreased the number of salons that offer aveda products 
partially offsetting the increase were lower net sales of clinique s simple hair care system 
the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products  which we take into account in our business planning 
geographic regions net sales in the americas increased or million to  million primarily reflecting growth from our newer brands as well as the success of new and recently launched products 
despite the increase  we continue to experience a soft retail environment in the united states 
in europe  the middle east africa  net sales increased or million to  million 
net sales in the united kingdom  spain  italy  france  switzerland and greece experienced double digit growth 
also contributing to the increase with double digit growth was our worldwide travel retail business  as sales recovered from the levels experienced after september  however  our travel retail business was adversely affected at the end of fiscal by certain world events including the lingering effects of the war in iraq and concerns associated with sars 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  europe  the middle east africa net sales increased 
net sales in asia pacific increased or million to million primarily due to higher net sales in korea  japan  australia and thailand 
despite increased net sales in japan  the country remains a difficult market due to local economic conditions and competition 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  asia pacific net sales increased 
we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market  which may account for differences in regional sales growth 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales improved to from  reflecting production and supply chain efficiencies and lower costs from promotional activities 
we continued to emphasize sourcing initiatives and overall supply chain management which resulted in lower manufacturing costs  whereas in the prior year we experienced under absorption of overhead as a result of the impact of the events of september  the inclusion of promotional merchandise as a component of cost of sales results in lower margins 
a strategic shift to reduce these activities has contributed to the improvement in our gross profit margin for the year 
the inclusion of the cost of purchase with purchase and gift with purchase merchandise as a component of cost of sales resulted from our adoption of eitf issue no 
since the cost of these promotional activities is a component of cost of sales and the timing and level of promotions vary with our promotional calendar  we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in the cost of sales percentage 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased to of net sales as compared with of net sales in the prior year period 
the current year results were impacted by a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of million or of net sales 
prior year operating expenses included a restructuring charge of million or of net sales 
before considering the effect of these two charges  operating expenses increased slightly to of net sales compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in spending primarily related to advertising  sampling and merchandising activities particularly during the early portion of fiscal excluding purchase with purchase and gift with purchase activities  discussed as a component of cost of sales which supported our sales growth and built momentum going into the second half of fiscal changes in advertising  sampling and merchandising spending result from the type  timing and level of activities related to product launches and rollouts  as well as the markets being emphasized 
operating results operating income increased or million to million as compared with the prior year period 
operating margins were of net sales in the current period as compared with in the prior year period 
these results include a charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding of million in the current year and a prior year restructuring charge of million 
absent these items  operating income increased or million to million and operating margins increased to as compared with in fiscal these increases in operating income and operating margin reflect sales growth  including the benefits from favorable foreign currency exchange rates to the us dollar and gross margin improvement  as well as benefits from our prior restructurings and our continued cost containment efforts 
net earnings and net earnings per diluted share increased approximately and  respectively 
net earnings improved million to million and net earnings per diluted share increased by 
from 
to 
absent the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in fiscal  net earnings increased by million or and diluted earnings per common share increased to from 
in the prior year 
before the fiscal charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding and the fiscal restructuring and the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle  net earnings increased to million and diluted earnings per common share increased to from in the prior year 
the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of the fiscal charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding and the fiscal restructuring 
we believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business 
the tables on page reconcile these results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statement of earnings 
product categories operating income more than doubled to million in fragrance due primarily to improved results from our travel retail business 
operating income increased to million in skin care and to million in makeup reflecting higher net sales  partially offset by strategic spending on advertising  sampling and merchandising  particularly in the earlier portion of the current year 
operating income increased million or to million in hair care  reflecting improvements in aveda and bumble and bumble  as well as higher profits in the latter portion of the year outside the united states 
geographic regions operating income in the americas increased or million to million due to sales growth  the benefits of our prior restructurings and continued cost containment efforts 
operating income also benefited from the results of strategic efforts related to product support spending in the earlier part of the year that led to increased net sales during the year 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income increased or million to million primarily due to the improved operating results in the united kingdom as well as increased results generated from our travel retail business 
as described elsewhere  profitability in the region has been and will continue to be affected by current international uncertainties 
in asia pacific  operating income decreased or million to million 
this decrease reflects improved results in korea and thailand  which were more than offset by a decrease in australia  which derived a benefit in the prior year period from a change in our retailer arrangements 
interest expense  net net interest expense was million as compared with million in the prior year 
the decrease in net interest expense was primarily due to lower outstanding net borrowings and higher interest income generated by higher invested cash balances 
this improvement was partially offset by a higher effective interest rate  which resulted from the increased proportion of fixed rate debt as compared with variable rate debt in the same period last year 
in may  we executed a fixed to floating interest rate swap on our million senior notes due see liquidity and capital resources for further details 
provision for income taxes the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes for the fiscal year was as compared with in the prior year period 
these rates differ from statutory rates  reflecting the effect of state and local taxes  tax rates in foreign jurisdictions and certain nondeductible expenses 
the decrease in the effective tax rate was principally attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives  including the favorable settlement of certain tax negotiations and the reduction of the overall tax rate relating to the company s foreign operations 
in addition  the tax effect of the charge related to the pending settlement of a legal proceeding in late fiscal contributed to an effective tax rate slightly lower than previously expected 
fiscal as compared with fiscal net sales net sales increased or million to billion reflecting growth in the makeup  skin care and hair care categories  partially offset by a decline in fragrance net sales 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  net sales increased 
the unusual events that occurred during fiscal and their effect on the economy  particularly in the united states  adversely impacted our business 
in addition  the decline in worldwide travel during most of fiscal led to a reduction in our travel retail sales 
sales growth from certain newer brands and recently launched products partially offset these decreases 
the following discussions of net sales by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of the restructurings in fiscal and fiscal neither restructuring was material to our net sales  and we believe the following analysis of net sales better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business 
for a discussion of the restructurings  see operating expenses restructuring and special charges in this section 
the tables on pages and reconcile these results to operating income as reporting in the consolidated statement of earnings 
product categories skin care net sales of skin care products increased or million to billion 
the net sales increase is primarily attributable to recently launched products such as total turnaround visible skin renewer  advanced night repair eye recovery complex  moisture surge extra thirsty skin relief and moisture surge eye gel  a perfect world line of products  lightsource transforming moisture lotion and cream  and re nutriv ultimate lifting creme 
partially offsetting these increases were lower net sales of certain existing products such as turnaround cream and resilience lift  as well as products in clinique s step skin care system 
makeup makeup net sales increased or million to billion 
newer brands such as mac  bobbi brown and stila  which are primarily makeup products  contributed through growth at existing doors and increased distribution 
in addition  strong sales of the pure color line of products  the worldwide launch of gentle light makeup and illusionist mascara contributed positively to net sales growth 
partially offsetting the increase in net sales were lower sales of two in one eye shadow  lucidity makeup  and long last soft shine lipstick 
fragrance net sales of fragrance products decreased or million to billion 
this category was impacted by the softness of the fragrance business in the united states and the decline in our travel retail business  which depends substantially on fragrance products 
lower net sales of beautiful  estee lauder pleasures  dkny for women and certain existing tommy hilfiger products were partially offset by the launch of t  a fragrance in the tommy hilfiger line  and intuition for men  as well as strong sales of donna karan cashmere mist 
hair care hair care net sales increased or million to million 
this increase was primarily the result of growth from aveda  which benefited from the launch of texture lotion products and color conserve shampoo and an increase in the number of company owned aveda experience centers 
sales of bumble and bumble products increased due to an expanded product line and an increase in the number of points of sale 
the results were partially offset by lower sales from clinique s simple hair care system when compared with the prior year launch 
the introduction of new products may have some cannibalizing effect on sales of existing products  which we take into account in our business planning 
geographic regions net sales in the americas increased or million to billion 
the increase was primarily due to the success of most newer brands  partially offset by economic weakness and uncertainty in the united states during most of the fiscal year 
in europe  the middle east africa  net sales increased or million to billion 
this increase was primarily the result of higher net sales in the united kingdom  spain and greece  where in fiscal we formed a joint venture  in which we own a controlling majority interest  with our former distributor 
the increase was partially offset by lower net sales in our travel retail business  which has been adversely affected by a decrease in worldwide travel 
excluding the impact of our travel retail business  net sales in europe  the middle east africa increased or million 
net sales in asia pacific increased or million to million primarily due to higher net sales in korea and thailand  as well as in australia where we benefited from a change in retailer arrangements 
the increased sales were partially offset by lower net sales in japan 
japan continued to be a difficult market due to local economic conditions and increasing competition 
the challenges were made more difficult by the weakness of the japanese yen during fiscal as compared with the us dollar 
excluding the impact of foreign currency translation  asia pacific net sales increased 
we strategically stagger our new product launches by geographic market  which may account for differences in regional sales growth 
cost of sales cost of sales as a percentage of total net sales was as compared with in the prior year 
the lower margin can be attributed in part to production volume decreases resulting in under absorption of overhead  as well as lower than planned raw material purchases that reduced anticipated savings from sourcing initiatives 
partially offsetting these negative factors were lower sales volumes of products with a higher cost of goods  particularly in travel retail and fragrance 
operating expenses operating expenses increased to of net sales as compared with of net sales in the prior year 
the increase in operating expenses primarily related to restructuring expenses  continued advertising and promotional spending and the cost to expand and operate our retail stores 
the increase in operating expenses as a percentage of net sales reflects a slower growth rate in sales than operating expenses  primarily due to economic conditions in the united states as discussed above 
as part of our long term strategies  we continued to emphasize the building of brand equities through advertising and promotional spending and retail store expansion despite difficult economic times 
changes in advertising and promotional spending result from the type  timing and level of advertising and promotional activities related to product launches and rollouts  as well as the markets being emphasized 
excluding the impact of restructuring and special charges  operating expenses were and of net sales for the fiscal years ended and  respectively 
restructuring and special charges during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded charges for a restructuring related to repositioning certain businesses as part of our ongoing efforts to drive long term growth and increase profitability 
the restructuring focused on cost reduction opportunities related to the internet  our supply chain  globalization of the organization and distribution channel refinements 
we committed to a defined plan of action  which resulted in an aggregate pre tax charge of million  of which million is cash related 
on an after tax basis  the aggregate charge was million  equal to 
per diluted share 
specifically  the charge included the following o internet 
in an effort to achieve strategic objectives  reduce costs and improve profitability  we outsourced gloss 
com platform development and maintenance efforts to a third party provider 
additionally  gloss 
com closed its san francisco facility and consolidated its operations in new york 
as a result  included in the charge was a million provision for restructuring the gloss 
com operations  including benefits and severance packages for employees as well as asset write offs 
we also took a million charge to write off the related gloss 
com acquisition goodwill 
o supply chain 
building on previously announced supply chain initiatives  we restructured certain manufacturing  distribution  research and development  information systems and quality assurance operations in the united states  canada and europe  which included benefits and severance for employees 
a charge of million was recorded related to this effort 
o globalization of organization 
we continued to implement our transition  announced in  to a global brand structure designed to streamline the decision making process and increase innovation and speed to market 
the next phase of this transition entailed eliminating duplicate functions and responsibilities  which resulted in charges for benefits and severance for employees 
we recorded a charge of million associated with these efforts 
o distribution 
we evaluated areas of distribution relative to our financial targets and decided to focus our resources on the most productive sales channels and markets 
as a result  we closed our operations in argentina and the remaining customers are being serviced by our chilean affiliate 
we began to close all remaining in store tommy s shops and we identified for closing other select points of distribution 
we recorded a million provision related to these actions  which included benefits and severance for employees 
following is a summary of the charges as recorded in the consolidated statement of earnings for fiscal restructuring net cost of operating sales sales expenses total in millions internet supply chain globalization of organization distribution total charge tax effect net charge the restructuring charge was recorded in other accrued liabilities or  where applicable  as a reduction of the related asset 
during fiscal  million related to this restructuring was paid 
we expected to  and did  settle a majority of the remaining obligations by the end of fiscal with certain additional payments to be made ratably through fiscal during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded charges for restructuring and special charges related to repositioning certain businesses as part of our ongoing efforts to drive long term growth and increase profitability 
the restructuring and special charges focused on four areas product fixtures for the jane brand  in store tommy shops  information systems and other assets  and global brand reorganization 
we committed to a defined plan of action  which resulted in an aggregate pre tax charge of million  of which million is cash related 
on an after tax basis  the aggregate charge was million  equal to 
per diluted share 
as of june   the remaining obligation was million with payments expected to be made ratably through fiscal operating results operating income decreased or million to million as compared with the prior year 
operating margins were of net sales in fiscal as compared with in the prior year 
the decrease in operating margin was primarily due to restructuring expenses  lower than expected sales levels  increased support spending and new distribution channel costs 
this was partially offset by the exclusion of amortization expense due to the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in fiscal and the november expiration of amortization related to purchased royalty rights 
operating income reflected the inclusion of restructuring and special charges of million and million in fiscal and  respectively 
before consideration of the restructuring and special charges  operating income decreased to million and operating margins were in fiscal as compared with in fiscal net earnings and net earnings per diluted share decreased approximately and  respectively 
net earnings declined million to million and net earnings per diluted share was lower by 
per diluted share from to 
on a comparable basis  before restructuring and special charges  before the cumulative effect of adopting a new accounting principle  and excluding goodwill amortization in fiscal  net earnings were million  representing a decrease of over the prior year  and diluted earnings per common share decreased to from in the prior year 
the following discussions of operating results by product categories and geographic regions exclude the impact of restructuring and special charges 
we believe the following analysis of operating income better reflects the manner in which we conduct and view our business 
the tables on pages and reconcile these results to operating income as reported in the consolidated statement of earnings 
product categories operating income decreased to million in fragrance  to million in makeup and to million in skin care  primarily due to lower than anticipated sales levels  coupled with continued advertising and promotional spending to promote new and recently launched products 
hair care operating income increased  from a smaller base  to million  primarily due to sales growth from aveda and bumble and bumble 
geographic regions operating income in the americas decreased or million to million  primarily due to lower sales attributable to weakness in the us economy and continued advertising and promotional spending 
in europe  the middle east africa  operating income decreased or million to million  primarily due to the significant decrease in our travel retail business 
partially offsetting the decrease were improved operating results in italy  the united kingdom  spain and germany 
we also benefited from the inclusion of operating results from our majority owned joint venture in greece 
in asia pacific  operating income decreased slightly to million due to lower income in china and hong kong offset by higher results in korea  in australia  where we benefited from a change in retailer arrangements  and in japan  where we were able to reduce operating expenses 
interest expense  net net interest expense was million as compared with million in the prior year 
the decrease in net interest expense resulted from a lower effective interest rate compared with the prior year 
this was primarily due to our interest rate risk management strategy that relied on commercial paper and variable rate term loans 
in january  we took advantage of prevailing market rates and issued fixed rate long term notes to replace our variable rate debt 
provision for income taxes the company s effective tax rate will change from year to year based on non recurring and recurring factors including  but not limited to  the geographical mix of earnings  the timing and amount of foreign dividends  state and local taxes  tax audit settlements and the interaction of various global tax strategies 
the provision for income taxes represents federal  foreign  state and local income taxes 
the effective rate for income taxes for fiscal was compared with in the prior year 
these rates reflect the effect of state and local taxes  changes in tax rates in foreign jurisdictions  tax credits and certain non deductible expenses 
the decrease in the effective income tax rate was attributable to ongoing tax planning initiatives  as well as a decrease in non deductible domestic royalty expense and the elimination of certain non deductible goodwill amortization resulting from the implementation of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
financial condition liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of funds historically have been cash flows from operations and borrowings under commercial paper  borrowings from the issuance of long term debt and committed and uncommitted credit lines provided by banks in the united states and abroad 
at june   we had cash and cash equivalents of million compared with million at june  at june   our outstanding borrowings of million included i million of senior notes due january consisting of million principal  an unamortized debt discount of million  and an million adjustment to reflect the fair value of an outstanding interest rate swap  ii a billion yen term loan approximately million at current exchange rates  which is due in march  iii million of other short term borrowings  and iv million of other long term borrowings 
in may  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to effectively convert the fixed rate interest on our outstanding million senior notes to variable interest rates based on libor 
in the short term  this will provide us with a lower level of interest expense related to the senior notes based on current variable interest rates  however  over the life of the notes  interest expense may be greater than based upon the fluctuations of libor 
we have a million commercial paper program under which we may issue commercial paper in the united states 
our commercial paper is currently rated a by standard poor s and p by moody s 
our long term credit ratings are a by standard poor s and a by moody s 
at june   we had no commercial paper outstanding 
we also have an effective shelf registration statement covering the potential issuance of up to million in debt securities 
as of june   we had an unused million revolving credit facility  expiring on june   and million in additional uncommitted credit facilities 
our business is seasonal in nature and  accordingly  our working capital needs vary 
from time to time  we may enter into investing and financing transactions that require additional funding 
to the extent that these needs exceed cash from operations  we could  subject to market conditions  issue commercial paper  issue long term debt securities or borrow under the revolving credit facility 
the effects of inflation have not been significant to our overall operating results in recent years 
generally  we have been able to introduce new products at higher selling prices or increase selling prices sufficiently to offset cost increases  which have been moderate 
we believe that cash on hand  cash generated from operations  available credit lines and access to credit markets will be adequate to support currently planned business operations and capital expenditures on both a near term and long term basis 
cash flows net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal as compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the improved operating cash flow primarily reflects increased earnings and seasonal levels of operating assets and liabilities 
operating assets and liabilities reflect an improvement in accounts receivable collections  and a higher level of accounts payable  partially offset by increased inventories in anticipation of product launches in the first half of fiscal and the impact of acquisitions on required inventory levels 
the improvement in net cash flows for fiscal compared to fiscal was generated primarily by a reduction of inventory 
inventory levels were unseasonably high at the end of fiscal and were lowered during fiscal as part of our effort to keep inventory levels in line with forecasted sales 
operating cash flows were generally not impacted by the fiscal restructuring as lower net earnings were offset by the non cash portion of the charge and the increase in other accrued liabilities 
net cash used for investing activities was million in fiscal  compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal net cash used in investing activities in fiscal primarily relates to capital expenditures and the acquisition of darphin and certain aveda distributors 
net cash used in investing activities during fiscal and fiscal relates primarily to capital expenditures 
capital expenditures amounted to million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
spending in all three years primarily reflected the continued upgrade of manufacturing equipment  dies and molds  new store openings  store improvements  counter construction and information technology enhancements 
the reduced level of capital expenditures in fiscal reflects tight control on our spending in light of economic conditions  fewer retail store openings and reduced spending related to leasehold improvements 
cash used for financing activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the net cash used for financing activities in primarily relates to common stock repurchases  the repayment of long term debt and dividend payments 
net cash used for financing during fiscal primarily relates to dividend payments and common stock repurchases 
the net cash used in fiscal was primarily related to dividend payments 
dividends the board of directors declared  and we paid on our class a common stock and class b common stock  an annual dividend of 
per share in fiscal and quarterly dividends at the rate of 
per share in each quarter of fiscal and the last quarterly dividend of 
per share was paid in the first quarter of fiscal as previously disclosed  the board of directors determined that  at its discretion  it would declare and the company would pay dividends on its common stock annually rather than quarterly commencing in fiscal in fiscal  and  dividends declared on our common stock totaled million  million and million  respectively 
total dividends declared  including dividends on the cumulative redeemable preferred stock  were million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
share repurchase program in september  our board of directors authorized a share repurchase program to repurchase a total of up to million shares of class a common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  depending on market conditions and other factors 
in october  the board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million additional shares of class a common stock  increasing the total authorization under the share repurchase program to million shares 
during fiscal  we purchased million shares for million 
as of june   we have purchased approximately million shares under this program 
subsequent to year end  we purchased an additional million shares for million bringing the cumulative total of acquired shares to million 
pension plan funding and expense we maintain pension plans covering substantially all of our full time employees for our us operations and a majority of our international operations 
several plans provide pension benefits based primarily on years of service and employees earnings 
in the united states  we maintain a trust based  noncontributory defined benefit pension plan us plan 
additionally  we have an unfunded  nonqualified domestic benefit plan to provide benefits in excess of internal revenue code limitations 
our international pension plans are comprised of defined benefit and defined contribution plans 
several factors influence our annual funding requirements 
for the us plan  our funding policy consists of an annual contribution at a rate that provides for future plan benefits and maintains appropriate funded percentages 
such contribution is not less than the minimum required by the employee retirement income security act of  as amended erisa  and subsequent pension legislation and is not more than the maximum amount deductible for income tax purposes 
for each international plan  our funding policies are determined by local laws and regulations 
in addition  amounts necessary to fund future obligations under these plans could vary depending on estimated assumptions as detailed in critical accounting polices and estimates 
the effect on operating results in the future of pension plan funding will depend on economic conditions  employee demographics  mortality rates  the number of participants electing to take lump sum distributions  investment performance and funding decisions 
during fiscal  we changed certain of the underlying assumptions associated with our pension plans based upon the recent past performance and outlook of the securities markets  resulting in a larger funding requirement 
in addition  the assets associated with the pension plans experienced negative investment returns  which also affected our funding requirements 
even after considering the impact of these factors  there was no minimum contribution to the us plan required by erisa for fiscal and however  at management s discretion  we made cash contributions to the us plan of million and million during fiscal and  respectively 
in addition  at june   we recognized a liability on our balance sheet for each pension plan if the fair market value of the assets of that plan was less than the accumulated benefit obligation and  accordingly  a charge is recorded in accumulated other comprehensive income loss in shareholders equity 
during fiscal and  we recorded a charge to accumulated other comprehensive income loss of million and million  respectively 
this charge had no impact on our consolidated net earnings or liquidity 
commitments and contingencies we will be required to redeem the outstanding cumulative redeemable preferred stock on june  however  in the event that mrs 
estee lauder were to pass away before such date  then we would have the right to redeem the shares from the current holders  and the holders of such shares would have the right to put the shares to us  at per share for an aggregate cost of million 
if shares of cumulative redeemable preferred stock are put to us  we would have up to days after notice to purchase such shares 
certain of our business acquisition agreements include earn out provisions 
these provisions generally require that we pay to the seller or sellers of the business additional amounts based on the performance of the acquired business 
the payments typically are made after a certain period of time and our next earn out payment is expected to be made after the end of fiscal since the size of each payment depends upon performance of the acquired business  we do not expect that such payments will have a material adverse impact on our future results of operations or financial condition 
under agreements covering our purchase of trademarks for a percentage of related sales  royalty payments totaling million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively  have been charged to expense 
such payments were made to mrs 
estee lauder 
this obligation is not necessarily fixed and determinable  and therefore has been excluded from the following contractual obligation table 
contractual obligations the following table summarizes scheduled maturities of our contractual obligations for which cash flows are fixed and determinable as of june  payments due in fiscal total thereafter in millions long term debt including current portion redeemable preferred stock lease commitments unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations  refer to note of notes to consolidated financial statements

in july  we signed a new lease for our principal offices at the same location 
our rental obligations under the new lease will commence in fiscal and expire in fiscal obligations pursuant to the lease in fiscal    and thereafter are million  million  million  million and million  respectively 
business acquisitions and license agreements in april  we acquired the paris based darphin group of companies that develops  manufactures and markets the darphin brand of skin care products 
the initial purchase price  paid at closing  was funded by cash provided by operations  and did not have a material effect on our results of operations or financial condition 
an additional payment is expected to be made in fiscal  the amount of which will depend on future net sales and earnings of the darphin business 
in may  we entered into a license agreement to manufacture and sell fragrances and beauty products under the michael kors trademarks with michael kors llc at the same time  we purchased certain related rights and inventory from american designer fragrances  a division of lvmh 
derivative financial instruments and hedging activities we address certain financial exposures through a controlled program of risk management that includes the use of derivative financial instruments 
we primarily enter into foreign currency forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options to reduce the effects of fluctuating foreign currency exchange rates 
we also enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the effects of fluctuating interest rates 
we categorize these instruments as entered into for purposes other than trading 
for each derivative contract entered into where we look to obtain special hedge accounting treatment  we formally document the relationship between the hedging instrument and hedged item  as well as its risk management objective and strategy for undertaking the hedge 
this process includes linking all derivatives that are designated as fair value  cash flow  or foreign currency hedges to specific assets and liabilities on the balance sheet or to specific firm commitments or forecasted transactions 
we also formally assess  both at the hedge s inception and on an ongoing basis  whether the derivatives that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items 
if it is determined that a derivative is not highly effective  then we will be required to discontinue hedge accounting with respect to that derivative prospectively 
foreign exchange risk management we enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions as well as receivables and payables denominated in foreign currencies for periods consistent with our identified exposures 
the purpose of the hedging activities is to minimize the effect of foreign exchange rate movements on our costs and on the cash flows that we receive from foreign subsidiaries 
almost all foreign currency contracts are denominated in currencies of major industrial countries and are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 
we also enter into foreign currency options to hedge anticipated transactions where there is a high probability that anticipated exposures will materialize 
the forward exchange contracts and foreign currency options entered into to hedge anticipated transactions have been designated as cash flow hedges 
as of june   these cash flow hedges were highly effective  in all material respects 
as a matter of policy  we only enter into contracts with counterparties that have at least an a or equivalent credit rating 
the counterparties to these contracts are major financial institutions 
we do not have significant exposure to any one counterparty 
our exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by any of the counterparties is limited to only the recognized  but not realized  gains attributable to the contracts 
management believes risk of loss under these hedging contracts is remote and in any event would not be material to the consolidated financial results 
the contracts have varying maturities through the end of june costs associated with entering into such contracts have not been material to our consolidated financial results 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
at june   we had foreign currency contracts in the form of forward exchange contracts and option contracts in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the foreign currencies included in forward exchange contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the euro million  swiss franc million  japanese yen million  british pound million  canadian dollar million  south korean won million and australian dollar million 
the foreign currencies included in the option contracts notional value stated in us dollars are principally the swiss franc million  canadian dollar million and euro million 
interest rate risk management we enter into interest rate derivative contracts to manage the exposure to fluctuations of interest rates on our funded and unfunded indebtedness  as well as cash investments  for periods consistent with the identified exposures 
all interest rate derivative contracts are with large financial institutions rated as strong investment grade by a major rating agency 
in may  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement with a notional amount of million to effectively convert fixed interest on the existing million senior notes to variable interest rates based on libor 
we designated the swap as a fair value hedge 
as of june   the fair value hedge was highly effective  in all material respects 
additionally  in may  we entered into a series of treasury lock agreements on a notional amount totaling million at a weighted average all in rate of 
these treasury lock agreements expire in september and are used to hedge the exposure to a possible rise in interest rates prior to the anticipated issuance of debt 
the agreements will be settled upon the issuance of the new debt  if completed  and any realized gain or loss to be received or paid by us will be amortized in interest expense over the life of the new debt 
we designated the treasury lock agreements as cash flow hedges 
as of june   the cash flow hedges were highly effective  in all material respects 
market risk we use a value at risk model to assess the market risk of our derivative financial instruments 
value at risk represents the potential losses for an instrument or portfolio from adverse changes in market factors for a specified time period and confidence level 
we estimate value at risk across all of our derivative financial instruments using a model with historical volatilities and correlations calculated over the past day period 
the measured value at risk  calculated as an average  for the twelve months ended june  related to our foreign exchange contracts was million 
as of june   the measured value at risk related to our interest rate contracts was million 
the model estimates were made assuming normal market conditions and a percent confidence level 
we used a statistical simulation model that valued our derivative financial instruments against one thousand randomly generated market price paths 
our calculated value at risk exposure represents an estimate of reasonably possible net losses that would be recognized on our portfolio of derivative financial instruments assuming hypothetical movements in future market rates and is not necessarily indicative of actual results  which may or may not occur 
it does not represent the maximum possible loss or any expected loss that may occur  since actual future gains and losses will differ from those estimated  based upon actual fluctuations in market rates  operating exposures  and the timing thereof  and changes in our portfolio of derivative financial instruments during the year 
we believe  however  that any loss incurred would be offset by the effects of market rate movements on the respective underlying transactions for which the hedge is intended 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not maintain any off balance sheet arrangements  transactions  obligations or other relationships with unconsolidated entities that would be expected to have a material current or future effect upon our financial condition or results of operations 
recently issued accounting standards in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas no 

sfas no 
established standards for classifying and measuring certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it specifically requires that mandatorily redeemable instruments  instruments with repurchase obligations which embody  are indexed to  or obligate the repurchase of  the issuer s own equity shares  and instruments with obligations to issue a variable number of the issuer s own equity shares  be classified as a liability 
initial and subsequent measurements of the instruments differ based on the characteristics of each instrument and as provided for in the statement 
sfas no 
is effective for all freestanding financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise became effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  we have adopted this statement effective for all instruments entered into or modified after may  and will adopt the statement for any existing financial instruments in the first quarter of fiscal based on the provisions of this statement  beginning in fiscal  we will be classifying the cumulative redeemable preferred stock as a liability and the related dividends thereon will be characterized as interest expense 
restatement of financial statements for earlier years presented is not permitted 
the adoption of this statement will result in the inclusion of the dividends on the preferred stock equal to million per year as interest expense 
while the inclusion will impact net earnings  net earnings attributable to common stock and earnings per common share will be unaffected 
given that the dividends are not deductible for income tax purposes  the inclusion of the preferred stock dividends as an interest expense will cause an increase in our effective tax rate 
the adoption of sfas no 
will have no impact on our financial condition 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation as originally defined by sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
additionally  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure in both the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transitional requirements of sfas no 
are effective for all financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  we adopted the disclosure portion of this statement for the fiscal quarter ended march  the application of the disclosure portion of this standard has no impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the fasb recently indicated that it will require stock based employee compensation to be recorded as a charge to earnings pursuant to a standard on which it is currently deliberating 
the fasb anticipates issuing an exposure draft in the fourth quarter of and a final statement in the second quarter of we will continue to monitor the fasb s progress on the issuance of this standard as well as evaluate our position with respect to current guidance
