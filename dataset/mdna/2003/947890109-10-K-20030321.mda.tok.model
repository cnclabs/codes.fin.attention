item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of webster financial corporation and the notes thereto collectively  the financial statements 
critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are defined as those that are reflective of significant judgments and uncertainties  and could potentially result in materially different results under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that our most critical accounting policies upon which our financial condition depends  and which involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments  are as follows allowance for loan losses arriving at an appropriate level of allowance for loan losses involves a high degree of judgment 
the company s allowance for loan losses provides for probable losses based upon evaluations of known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
management uses historical information to assess the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses as well as the prevailing business environment  as it is affected by changing economic conditions and various external factors  which may impact the portfolio in ways currently unforeseen 
the allowance is increased by provisions for loan losses and by recoveries of loans previously charged off and reduced by loans charged off 
for a full discussion of the company s methodology of assessing the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  see the asset quality section elsewhere within this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation 
income taxes the company accounts for income taxes by deferring income taxes based on estimated future tax effects of differences between the tax and book basis of assets and liabilities considering the provisions of enacted tax laws 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheets 
the company must also assess the likelihood that any deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and establish a valuation allowance for those assets determined to not likely be recoverable 
management judgment is required in determining the amount and timing of recognition of the resulting deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the actual realization of the assets could differ materially from that recognized if actual factors and conditions differ from those used by management 
these factors and conditions include federal and state tax laws and regulations and future level of webster s taxable income 
valuation of goodwill intangible assets and analysis for impairment webster  in part  has increased its market share through acquisitions accounted for under the business combinations method of accounting  as well as from the purchase of financial institution s branches and selected assets not entire institution 
for acquisitions under the purchase method and the acquisition of financial institution branches  the company is required to record assets acquired and liabilities assumed at their fair value which is an estimate determined by the use of internal or other valuation techniques 
these valuation estimates result in goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill is subject to ongoing periodic impairment tests and is evaluated using various fair value techniques including multiples of price equity and price earnings ratios 
for a discussion of impairment testing methodology  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this report 
pension and other post retirement benefits the determination of the company s obligation and expense for pension and other post retirement benefits is dependent upon certain assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
key assumptions used in the actuarial valuations include the discount rate  expected long term rate of return on plan assets and rates of increase in compensation and health care costs 
actual results could differ from the assumptions and market driven rates may fluctuate 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in the assumptions may materially affect the future pension and other post retirement obligations and expense

results of operations comparison of and years for the year  net income was million  or per diluted common share  an increase of million  or  compared to net income of million or per share for the previous year 
the improvement was the result of increased net interest income and noninterest income that more than offset increases in the provision for loan losses and noninterest expenses 
net interest income rose to million for  an increase of million  or

noninterest income reached million  an increase of million  or  when compared to million the previous period

and an extraordinary expense of million net of taxes that represents costs incurred for early extinguishment of debt for the prepayment of borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
net interest income net interest income totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this resulted mainly from an increase in average outstanding earning assets during the year and from an increase in the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis to for from during the prior year 
see the rate volume table below for further information 
the decline in interest rates during resulted in a favorable environment for webster 
as rates dropped and mortgage and other assets prepaid at increasing levels  and the proceeds were reinvested at lower yields 
however  maturing and repricing liabilities were replaced at even lower costs 
as can be seen from the rate volume table that follows  of the increase in net interest income is due to changes in interest rates  with liability costs dropping faster than asset yields 
the remaining increase is due to the volume growth in earning assets funded by the growth in low cost core deposits 
see asset liability management and market risk section within management s discussion and analysis for additional information 
the growth of billion in average outstanding earning assets during slightly outpaced the growth in average interest bearing liabilities of million 
the growth in earning assets versus accounted for of the increase in net interest income 
net interest income also can be understood in terms of the impact of changing rates and changing volumes 
the following table describes the extent to which changes in interest rates and changes in the volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities have impacted interest income and interest expense during the periods indicated 
information is provided in each category with respect to i changes attributable to changes in volume changes in volume multiplied by prior rate  ii changes attributable to changes in rates changes in rates multiplied by prior volume and iii the net change

the decline in the yield on earning assets was the primary cause of decreased interest income 
this was due to the lower interest rate environment in when compared with the yield earned on earning assets declined during to from during the year earlier 
in addition to the larger volume of mortgage and other fixed rate loan prepayments during the current year  declines in interest rates impacted the returns on adjustable rate loans  which accounted for approximately of total loans at december  earning assets rose during  partially offsetting the reduced yield 
earning assets averaged billion during the year  up from billion during growth occurred primarily in the available for sale securities portfolio and in commercial and consumer loans 
interest expense interest expense declined million  or  to million for as compared to million the previous year 
the decline in expense was primarily due to the decrease in cost of funds  partially offset by increased volume 
due to the short maturity structure of webster s funding sources  webster was able to take advantage of falling interest rates throughout almost one half  or  of the benefit of declining interest rates was realized in the wholesale borrowing area 
the cost of repurchase agreements and other borrowings and fhlb advances also decreased during by and basis points  respectively

management performs a quarterly review of the loan portfolio to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
see the allowance for loan losses methodology section later in this management s discussion and analysis for further details 
based upon these reviews  it was determined that the provision for loan losses should be increased over the second half of factors that influenced this increase included the following o during the fourth quarter  webster took action to eliminate its exposure to classified telecommunications and cable loans by sale or by transfer to held for sale 
this resulted in an additional fourth quarter charge to the provision of million 
o the bank s strategic plan is to change the mix of the loan portfolio and increase the proportion of commercial and consumer loans and decrease residential mortgage loans 
commercial and consumer lending carry inherently more risk than residential lending 
o net charge offs increased to million during from million the previous year  an increase of million or 
the net charge offs were concentrated in the commercial lending area  which accounted for million  or  of the total 
the million of net charge offs does not include the million of writedowns related to the telecommunication loans transferred to held for sale 
at december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of total loans

the increase in security gains was in response to the favorable environment for the securities sold and other opportunities available 
deposit service fees increased mainly due to fees associated with usage of webster checking products  including the introduction of high performance checking 
loan fees increased chiefly due to prepayment penalties  as borrowers sought to refinance their outstanding loans as a result of declining rates 
the acquisition of whitehall in august contributed to loan service fee income of million in from million in insurance revenue continued to show growth in with an increase of million 
this is due principally to increased premiums for property and casualty insurance post september  as well as successful sales efforts by webster insurance staff 
the acquisition of wolff zackin and benefits plans design insurance agencies in april has also helped to enhance the increases in insurance revenue 
the decline in trust and investment services is the result of declines in stock values and retail investor purchase activity 
fee revenue is based off the value of assets under management 
the increased financial advisory services revenue primarily resulted from the increase in valuation services related to client s implementation of sfas no 
during a significant portion of the decrease in other noninterest income for was the receipt of a nonrecurring million bank owned life insurance boli benefit payment in noninterest expenses the following table presents the composition of noninterest expenses for the years ended december  and increase decrease dollars in thousands amount compensation and benefits    occupancy   furniture and equipment    goodwill and intangible amortization    marketing    professional services    acquisition related   capital securities   dividends on preferred stock of subsidiary corporation branch reconfiguration   other expenses    total noninterest expenses    the increase in compensation and benefits of million over the prior year is the result of million in salaries due to merit increases for full time employees  and increases in staffing due to the expansion of the business 
this includes increased temporary help and higher commissions due to increased volume in our mortgage lending business 
the current year reflects the full year impact of acquisitions as well as the year addition of whitehall 
benefits expense comprised million of the increase and is related to higher group insurance  pension expense and payroll taxes 
the decrease in goodwill and intangible amortization is the result of the adoption of sfas nos 
and which no longer requires amortization of goodwill as an expense 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere in this report for further information 
the impact on was approximately million

on july   webster announced effective july   it will begin to expense the cost of employee stock option using sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 webster had previously elected to use apb no 
to account for employee stock based compensation 
by electing to use the preferred method under sfas no 
 compensation expense will be recorded for employee stock option grants using the fair value method and amortized over the vesting period  commencing with grants made during for the current year  compensation and benefits expense includes  of stock option expense 
this amount will grow as the application of sfas no 
becomes fully phased in 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for information on the full impact of expensing stock options 
income taxes income tax expense for increased to million from million in the increase is primarily due to the increase in income before taxes for the reasons discussed above

comparison of and years net interest income net interest income totaled million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
the factors causing this change were an increase in the net interest margin on a fully taxable equivalent basis to for from during the prior year and an increase in average earning assets during the year 
see the rate volume table that is contained elsewhere within this report 
the decline in interest rates during  combined with a steepening of the yield curve  resulted in a favorable environment for webster 
as interest rates dropped and mortgage and mortgage related securities assets prepaid at increasing levels  yields dropped as these assets were replaced with ones earning lower yields 
however  maturing and repricing liabilities  deposits and borrowings  were replaced at even lower costs due to the steepness of the yield curve 
as can be seen from the rate volume table that precedes this section  of the increase in net interest income is due to the decline in interest rates  with liability costs dropping much faster than asset yields 
the growth of million in average earning assets during outpaced the growth in average interest bearing liabilities of million 
the increase in earning assets versus  occurring primarily in investments and in commercial and consumer loans  accounted for of the increase in net interest income 
interest income total interest income increased million  or  to million for the year as compared to million during the previous year 
as discussed above  the increase was due entirely to increased volume of earning assets during as compared to the previous year 
although loans and mortgage related securities prepaid at increased volumes during due to the declining interest rate environment  webster was able to increase assets through the acquisition of mechanics in and center capital in as well as through the increase in consumer loans 
the increased consumer loans were primarily home equity lines of credit  the majority of which were originated within the bank s primary market area 
the yield earned on earning assets declined during to from during the year earlier 
the decline was entirely within the loan category as the yield on loans declined basis points  while the yield on securities and short term investments increased by basis points 
in addition to the larger volume of mortgage and other fixed rate loan prepayments during the current year  as discussed above  declines in interest rates impacted the returns on adjustable rate loans  which accounted for approximately of total loans at december  interest expense interest expense declined million  or  to million for fiscal year as compared to million the previous year 
the decline was entirely due to the decrease in the cost of funds 
due to the short maturity structure of the wholesale borrowing portfolio  webster was able to take advantage of falling rates throughout two thirds of the benefit of declining rates was realized in the wholesale borrowing area 
the deposit area accounted for one third of the rate decline benefit 
savings  checking and certificate of deposit offering rates were decreased as general market interest rates declined throughout the year 
the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million for compared to the mechanics acquisition accounted for a portion of the volume increase as the balances were outstanding for all of  as opposed to only half a year in approximately half of the increase occurred in repurchase agreements and other borrowings due to their relative lower cost 
the remainder of the increase occurred in money market and checking accounts 
provision for loan losses the provision for loan losses increased to million for the year ended december  from million the year earlier  an increase of million or 
management performs a quarterly review of the loan portfolio to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses

the net charge offs were concentrated in the commercial lending area  which accounted for million  or  of the total 
o nonaccrual loans increased to million  or of total loans  at december   from million  or  a year earlier 
o the general economic slowdown has raised concerns about employment stability and economic health in connecticut and the country 
at december   the allowance for loan losses totaled million or of total loans 
a year earlier  the allowance totaled million or of total loans 
noninterest income the most significant factor in the increase in noninterest income was the acquisitions completed during and the june mechanics acquisition  as well as the purchase of branches from fleetboston and chase manhattan during the year  added to deposit fees 
the center capital acquisition during added to loan fee income 
the continued expansion of webster insurance  with the purchase of the louis levine agency  inc  levine in and wolff zackin  benefit plans and musante in  added to insurance revenue 
duff phelps was acquired in november and added income from financial advisory services 
webster s plan has been to expand its sources of noninterest income through the acquisition of fee based businesses and become less reliant on net interest income 
noninterest expenses noninterest expenses increased million or 
again  acquisitions in and played the most significant role in the increase 
adjusting both years for the effect of purchase acquisitions  noninterest expenses would have increased less than

liquidity and capital resources liquidity management allows webster to meet cash needs at a reasonable cost under various operating environments 
liquidity is actively managed and reviewed in order to maintain stable  cost effective funding to support growth in the balance sheet 
liquidity comes from a variety of sources such as the cash flow from operating activities including principal and interest payments on loans and investments  unpledged securities which can be sold or utilized to secure funding and by the ability to attract new deposits 
webster s goal is to maintain a strong  increasing base of core deposits to support its growing balance sheet 
the main sources of liquidity are payments of principal and interest from its loan and securities portfolio and the ability to use its loan and securities portfolios as collateral for secured borrowings 
the bank is a member of the fhlb system 
at december   outstanding fhlb advances totaled billion and the bank had additional borrowing capacity from the fhlb of million 
investment securities were not pledged as collateral for fhlb advances at december  had securities been used for collateral  additional borrowing capacity would be approximately billion 
the bank also has the ability to borrow funds through repurchase agreements  using the securities portfolio as collateral 
at december   outstanding repurchase agreements totaled billion 
fhlb advances  repurchase agreements and other borrowings increased million from the prior year end  primarily to fund the increase in loans 
other factors affecting liquidity include loan origination volumes  loan prepayment rates  maturity structure of existing loans  core deposit growth levels  time deposit maturity structure and retention  credit ratings  investment portfolio cash flows  the composition  characteristics and diversification of wholesale funding sources  and the market value of investment securities that can be used to collateralize fhlb advances and repurchase agreements 
the bank s liquidity position is influenced by general interest rate levels  economic conditions and competition 
for example  as interest rates decline  payments of principal from the loan and mortgage backed securities portfolio accelerate  as borrowers are more willing to prepay 
additionally  the market value of the securities portfolio generally increases as rates decline  thereby increasing the amount of collateral available for funding purposes 
management monitors current and projected cash needs and adjusts liquidity as necessary 
liquidity policy ratios are designed to measure the liquidity from several different perspectives maturity concentration  diversification  and liquidity reserve 
actual ratios are measured against policy limits 
in addition to funding under normal market conditions  there is a contingency funding plan which is designed for dealing with liquidity under a crisis so that measures can be implemented in an orderly and timely manner 
webster s main sources of liquidity at the parent company level are dividends from the bank  investment income and net proceeds from borrowings and capital offerings 
the main uses of liquidity are purchases of available for sale securities  the payment of dividends to common stockholders  repurchases of webster s common stock  and the payment of interest to holders of senior notes and capital securities 
there are certain restrictions on the payment of dividends by the bank to webster 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for further information on dividend restrictions 
webster also maintains million in revolving lines of credit with correspondent banks as a source of additional liquidity 
during and  webster repurchased a total of  and  shares  respectively  of its common stock utilizing funds of approximately million and million respectively 
the repurchased shares were the result of an announcement during the third quarter of a stock repurchase program to acquire million shares of its common stock 
webster announced an additional stock repurchase program during the third quarter of to buyback an additional million shares 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for further information concerning stock repurchases 
on january   the bank completed an offering of million of subordinated notes 
the notes have an interest rate of and will mature on january  the notes constitute new funding and will supplement the bank s existing capital  including regulatory capital 
the bank is required by regulations adopted by the ots to maintain minimum levels of liquidity sufficient to ensure safe and sound operations 
adequate liquidity  as assessed by the ots  may vary from institution to institution depending on such factors as the institution s overall asset liability structure  market conditions  competition and the nature of the institution s deposit and loan customers 
management believes it exceeds all regulatory and operational liquidity requirements at december  applicable ots regulations require the bank  as a federal savings bank  to satisfy certain minimum capital requirements  including a leverage capital requirement and risk based capital requirements 
as an ots regulated savings institution  the bank is also subject to a minimum tangible capital requirement 
at december   the bank was in full compliance with all applicable capital requirements and met the fdic requirements for a well capitalized institution 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for further information concerning capital

webster s primary market risk is interest rate risk 
interest rate risk can be defined as the sensitivity of the economic value of webster s assets less the economic value of its liabilities and off balance sheet contracts equity at risk and the sensitivity of webster s earnings to changes in interest rates earnings at risk 
both types of risk measure a change in value for given changes in interest rates 
equity at risk analyzes sensitivity in the present value of cash flows over the expected life of the bank s existing assets  liabilities and off balance sheet contracts 
it is a measure of the long term interest rate risk to future earnings streams embedded in the bank s current balance sheet 
the bank utilizes asset liability models to measure equity and earnings at risk 
key assumptions underlying the present value of cash flows include the behavior of interest rates and spreads  asset prepayment speeds and attrition rates on deposits 
cashflow projections from the model are continually compared to market expectations for similar collateral type and adjusted based on webster experience with its own portfolio 
the model s valuation results are compared to observable market prices for similar instruments whenever possible 
the bank studies the behavior of its deposit and loan customers using historical time series analysis to model future customer behavior under varying interest rate environments 
earnings at risk analyzes sensitivity in net income over a twelve month horizon 
it uses the same assumptions as equity at risk on the existing balance sheet  but also includes balance sheet growth assumptions over the next twelve months 
it is a measure of short term interest rate risk to reported earnings of the bank 
webster believes that an effective asset liability management process must balance the risks and rewards from both long and short term interest rate risks in determining management strategy and action 
to facilitate and manage this process  webster has an asset liability committee alco 
the primary goal of webster s alco is to manage interest rate risk to maximize net economic value and net income over time in changing interest rate environments subject to board of director approved limits 
the board approves limits for both equity and earnings at risk for parallel shocks in interest rates of plus and minus and basis points 
webster also typically analyzes rate shocks of basis points as well as ad hoc scenarios for specific economic scenarios 
with today s overnight interest rate at  downward parallel rate shocks of more than basis points are unrealistic and therefore not currently analyzed 
equity and earnings at risk are quantified using simulation software from one of the leading firms in the field of asset liability modeling 
from such simulations  interest rate risk is quantified and appropriate strategies are formulated and implemented 
the simulation process uses multiple interest rate paths generated by an arbitrage free trinomial lattice term structure model 
the base case rate scenario  against which all others are compared  uses the month end libor swap yield curve as a starting point to derive forward rates for future months 
using interest rate swap option volatilities as inputs  the model creates multiple rate paths for this scenario with forward rates as the mean 
in shock scenarios  the starting yield curve is shocked up or down in a parallel fashion 
future rate paths are then constructed in a similar manner to the base case 
cash flows for all instruments are created for each scenario and each rate path using product specific prepayment models and account specific system data for properties such as maturity date  amortization type  coupon rate and repricing date 
webster enhances its asset liability simulation software with a mortgage prepayment model and a collateralized mortgage obligation database 
instruments with explicit options ie  caps  floors  puts and calls and implicit options ie  prepayment and early withdrawal ability require such a rate and cashflow modeling approach to more accurately quantify value and risk 
on the asset side  webster s risk is impacted the most by a large amount of mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities  which can typically prepay at any time without penalty and may have embedded caps and floors 
on the liability side  webster has a large concentration of customers with indeterminate maturity deposits who have options to add or withdraw funds from their accounts at any time 
the bank also has the option to change the rate paid on these deposits at any time 
webster has four main tools for managing interest rate risk the size and duration of the investment portfolio  the size and duration of the wholesale funding portfolio  off balance sheet interest rate contracts and the pricing and structure of its loans and deposits 
alco meets at least monthly to make decisions on the investment and funding portfolios based on the economic outlook  the committee s interest rate expectations  the bank s risk position and other factors 
alco delegates pricing and product design responsibilities to individuals and sub committees  but monitors and influences their actions on a regular basis 
webster can use various interest rate contracts  including futures and options  interest rate swaps and interest rate caps and floors to manage interest rate risk by reducing net exposures 
as of december   webster was paying the floating rate side of million in interest rate swaps of varying maturities 
these swaps were entered into during in order to convert fixed rate federal home loan bank advances into floating rate liabilities 
all of webster s swaps qualify for the short cut hedge accounting treatment under sfas no 
these interest rate contracts involve  to varying degrees  credit risk and interest rate risk 
credit risk is the possibility that a loss may occur if a counterparty to a transaction fails to perform according to the terms of the contract 
the notional amount of interest rate contracts is the amount upon which interest and other payments are based 
the notional amount is not exchanged and therefore  the notional amounts should not be taken as a measure of credit risk 
see notes and of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for additional information 
webster can also hold futures and options positions to minimize the price volatility of certain assets held as trading securities 
changes in the market value of these positions are recognized in the consolidated statements of income in the period for which the change occurred 
the following table summarizes the estimated economic value of webster s assets  liabilities and hedges at december  and  and the projected change to economic values if interest rates instantaneously increase or decrease by basis points 
estimated estimated economic value book economic change dollars in thousands value value bp bp assets     liabilities     off balance sheet contracts    decrease increase in net economic value   net change as of tier capital assets     liabilities     decrease increase in net economic value   net change as of tier capital the book value of assets exceeded the estimated market value at december  and because the equity at risk model assigns no value to goodwill and other intangible assets  which totaled million and million  respectively 
the above table includes interest earning assets that are not directly impacted by changes in interest rates 
assets include equity securities of million at december  and million at december  equity securities include million of fhlb stock million of preferred stock and million in common stock at december  see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for further information concerning investment securities 
values for mortgage servicing rights have been included in the tables above as movements in interest rates affect the valuation of the servicing rights 
the change in sensitivity between and is due to changes in the interest rate environment and structural changes in the balance sheet 
interest rates have fallen and the yield curve has flattened with short rates down basis points and long rates down from to basis points from the prior year end 
this has shortened mortgage related asset durations and lengthened core deposit durations significantly 
in addition  while long duration core non maturity deposit volumes have grown by approximately million in the past year  most of the asset growth has been concentrated in short duration floating rate assets like home equity credit lines and asset based commercial lending 
duration is expressed in terms of years and is a measure of the price sensitivity of financial instruments for small changes in interest rates 
for fixed rate instruments it can also be thought of as the weighted average expected time to receive future cash flows 
the longer the duration  the greater the price sensitivity for changes in interest rates 
floating rate instruments are considered to have a duration of one month and therefore have very little price sensitivity due to changes in interest rates 
increases in interest rates typically reduce the value of assets as future discounted cash flows are worth less at higher discount rates 
a liability s value decreases for the same reason in a rising rate environment 
a reduction in value of a liability is a benefit  however  as this is an obligation of the bank 
a duration gap between assets and liabilities near zero implies that the balance sheet is matched and would exhibit no change in estimated economic value for a small change in interest rates 
a negative duration gap implies that assets are shorter than liabilities and therefore  they have less economic price sensitivity than liabilities and will reset their interest rates faster than liabilities 
consequently  webster s net estimated economic value would increase when rates rise as the decreased value of liabilities would more than offset the decreased value of assets 
the opposite would occur when rates fall 
webster s net income would also generally be expected to increase when rates rise and decrease when rates fall 
webster s duration gap was a negative at year end 
the estimated change in webster s net income for the subsequent twelve month period beginning december  for an increase and decrease in interest rate of basis point was an increase of and a decrease of  respectively 
this estimate assumes interest rates instantaneously increase or decrease parallel along the yield curve 
at december   the estimated changes were a decrease of and an increase of  respectively 
webster expects interest rates to rise in second half of and is positioned to benefit accordingly 
this position has been achieved primarily through shortening duration of the investment portfolio and strong growth in core deposits 
these estimates assume that management does not take any action to mitigate any positive or negative effects from changing interest rates 
the economic values and net income estimates are subject to factors that could cause actual results to differ 
management believes that webster s interest rate risk position at december  represents a reasonable level of risk given the low probability of a further significant decline in interest rates 
management  as always  is prepared to act in the event that interest rates do fall 
financial condition at december   total assets were billion  an increase of billion  or  as compared to total assets of billion at december  the increase in total assets for the current year period was primarily due to an increase in loans of billion 
total liabilities increased billion for the current year period primarily due to increases in deposits and borrowings of million and million  respectively 
total equity at december  and was billion 
securities increased by million  or  to billion at december  as mortgage securities prepaid at accelerated speeds due to the low interest rate environment during  webster reinvested these funds into its securities portfolio 
these additional investments were primarily mortgage related securities  as their balance rose to billion at december  from billion  an increase of 
loans  net increased billion  or  to billion at december  webster made progress in achieving its strategic plan for the loan portfolio 
the plan called for an increase in the percentage of outstanding commercial and consumer loans  while reducing the reliance on residential mortgage loans 
residential mortgage loans decreased to of net loans at december  from a year earlier 
commercial and consumer loans increased to and  respectively  from and  respectively  a year earlier 
loans held for sale totaled million at december   an increase of million  or  from a year earlier 
as webster s wholesale lending volume increased substantially  so did the balance of loans held for sale 
at december   webster s net deferred tax asset approximated million  and included a valuation allowance of approximately million for the full amount of the connecticut state tax portion of its gross deferred tax assets  due to uncertainties of realization 
management believes it is more likely than not that webster will realize its net deferred tax assets  based upon its recent historical and anticipated future levels of pre tax income 
there can be no absolute assurance  however  that webster will generate any specific level of future income 
deposits increased million  or  to billion at december  deposits also reflected the success of webster s strategic plan 
the increase occurred entirely in the lower cost  non maturity deposits  as demand deposits  now accounts  regular savings and money market deposits which increased by million  or while higher cost certificates of deposit decreased by million  or 
certificates of deposit decreased as a percentage of total deposits to at december  from a year earlier 
as a result of the combined effects of the decrease in interest rates during and the migration of deposits to lower cost  non maturity deposits  the weighted average interest rate dropped to at december  from a year earlier 
total borrowings increased million  or  to billion at december  due to the current low interest rate environment  a portion of the borrowings portfolio was swapped from fixed to floating to take advantage of the current lower rates 
during  million of fhlb advances outstanding at december  matured and million was called prior to maturity 
new borrowings consisted of million of new year advances  million of year advances and million of years advances 
the swapping of these transactions should reduce the volatility of borrowing costs over the short term 
total shareholders equity at december  was billion 
the million increase in equity is primarily due to net income of million and the change in unrealized gains on available for sale securities of million  partially offset by cash dividends of million and stock repurchases of million 
asset quality asset quality improved significantly in as nonperforming assets declined to million compared to million at year end classified loans totaled million at december   a decline of million from million a year ago 
these improvements were due primarily to the elimination of webster s exposure to classified telecommunications and cable loans in as a result of the sale and writedown of these loans  management increased the loan loss provision in the fourth quarter 
the level of the overall loan loss allowance has increased to of total loans at year end compared with at december  management believes the level of allowance at december  is adequate for the level of risks in the portfolio 
nonperforming assets  classified assets  loan delinquency and credit losses are considered by webster to be key measures of asset quality 
asset quality is one of the key factors in the determination of the level of the allowance for loan losses 
see allowance for loan losses contained elsewhere within this section for further information on the allowance 
nonperforming assets webster devotes significant attention to maintaining asset quality through conservative underwriting standards  active servicing of loans and aggressively managing nonperforming assets 
nonperforming assets  which include nonaccrual loans and loans held for sale  loans past due days or more and accruing and foreclosed properties were million and million at december  and  respectively 
the aggregate amount of nonperforming assets decreased as a percentage of total assets to at december  from at december  nonperforming loans were million at december   compared to million at december  nonperforming loans are defined as nonaccruing loans and loans past due or more days and accruing 
the ratio of nonperforming loans to total loans was and at december  and  respectively 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million and represented of nonperforming loans and of total loans 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was million and represented of nonperforming loans and of total loans 
interest on nonaccrual loans that would have been recorded as additional income for the years ended december   and had the loans been current in accordance with their original terms approximated million  million  and million  respectively 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained elsewhere within this report for information concerning webster s nonaccrual loan policy 
the decrease in nonperforming loans of million  or  was due mainly to five classified shared national telecommunications credits totaling million  million of which were nonperforming and two classified shared national cable credits totaling million  which were sold or transferred to held for sale during the fourth quarter of a writedown of million was taken against the allowances for loan losses at the time of sale or transfer

occasionally  there are circumstances that cause loans to be placed in the days and accruing category  for example  loans that are considered to be well secured and in the process of collection 
troubled debt restructures the following accruing loans are considered troubled debt restructurings consistent with sfas no

a loan is considered substandard if  in the opinion of management  there are potential deficiencies which could result in the loan becoming inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or by the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard loans include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the institution could sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
loans classified as doubtful have all of the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses that are present make collection or liquidation in full on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
loans classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and of such little value that to continue to report them as loans without the establishment of a specific loss reserve is not warranted 
the loan classification system is consistent with the classification system prescribed by the ots 
when loans are classified as either substandard or doubtful  a portion of the allowance for loan losses in an amount deemed prudent by management is allocated as either a specific reserve or a general reserve against such loans 
specific reserves represent an allocation of the allowance against specific credits where a deficiency in collateral value or cash flow exists 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere within this report for additional information  including the recognition of cash basis interest income 
all other substandard or doubtful loans receive an allocation of a general reserve 
general reserves represent a portion of the allowance for loan losses which has been allocated to recognize the inherent risk associated with these loans 
when loans are classified as loss  a specific allowance for the loss is established equal to of the amount of the loan and a charge off is subsequently taken for such amount 
an institution s determination as to the classification of its loans and the amount of its allocated reserves is subject to review by the ots  which can require the establishment of additional reserves if it is in disagreement with the institution

at december   there was a decrease of million in classified loans from the prior year end 
this decrease occurred primarily in the specialized portfolio  in which classified loans declined million 
this decline was due primarily to the fourth quarter telecommunication and cable loans activity previously discussed 
improvements were also achieved in the residential  consumer and cre portfolios 
the improvements were somewhat offset by an increase in classified commercial banking loans of million 
classified loans as a percent of total loans decreased to from the prior year 
classified as a percentage of loans in the specialized portfolio decreased to at december  from at december  classified commercial banking loans also decreased to of the portfolio from the prior year although classified loan totals increased 
the classified loans table above does not include loans held for sale 
at december   there were million in commercial loans held for sale that were classified as substandard 
at december   there were no classified held for sale loans 
because webster believes that early identification and management of problem loans serves to minimize future losses  it employs a rigorous portfolio review and management process  which identifies deteriorating credit risk and proactively manages problem loans 
at december   million of nonperforming loans excluding accruing troubled debt restructurings were included in the classified loan total 
the remaining classified loans of million continued to perform in accordance with their contractual terms and to accrue interest 
under the definition of substandard above  these loans are considered by management to be potential problem loans 
allowance for loan losses methodology the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level estimated by management to provide adequately for probable losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
probable losses are estimated based upon a quarterly review of the loan portfolio  past loss experience  specific problem loans  economic conditions and other pertinent factors which  in management s judgment  deserve current recognition in estimating loan losses 
in assessing the specific risks inherent in the portfolio  management takes into consideration the risk of loss on nonaccrual loans  classified loans and watch list loans including an analysis of the collateral for such loans 
the allowance for loan losses at december  and totaled million and million  respectively 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to cover expected losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
management considers the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses a critical accounting policy  consistent with the sec s financial release concerning critical accounting policies 
as such  the adequacy of allowance for loan losses is subject to judgment in its determination 
actual loan losses could differ materially from management s calculation if actual loss factors and conditions differ significantly from the assumptions utilized by management 
these factors and conditions include the general economic conditions within connecticut and nationally  trends within industries where the loan portfolio is concentrated  real estate values  interest rates and the financial condition of individual borrowers 
while management believes the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december   actual results may prove different and these differences could be significant 
webster s methodology for assessing the appropriateness of the allowance consists of several key elements 
the loan portfolio is segmented into pools of loans that are similar in type and risk characteristic 
these homogeneous pools are tracked over time and historic delinquency  nonaccrual and loss information is collected and analyzed 
in addition  problem loans are identified and analyzed individually on a periodic basis to detect specific probable losses 
webster collects industry delinquency  nonaccrual and loss data for the same portfolio segments for comparison purposes 
webster analyzes the data and estimates probable losses in the portfolio by calculating formula allowances for homogeneous pools of loans and classified loans and specific allowances for impaired loans 
the formula allowance is calculated by applying loss factors to the loan pools based on historic default and loss rates  internal risk ratings  and other risk based characteristics 
changes in risk ratings  and other risk factors  from period to period for both performing and nonperforming loans affect the calculation of the formula allowance 
loss factors are based on webster s loss experience  and may be adjusted for significant factors that  in management s judgment  affect the collectability of the portfolio as of the evaluation date 
webster s approach fully allocates the allowance 
at december  there were no unallocated reserves 
webster considers the following when determining probable losses o webster utilizes migration models  which track the dynamic business characteristics inherent in the specific portfolios 
the assumptions are updated periodically to match changes in the business cycle 
o pooled loan loss factors not individually graded loans are based on expected net charge offs 
pooled loans are loans that are homogeneous in nature  such as residential and consumer loans 
o the loan portfolios are characterized by historical statistics such as default rates  cure rates  loss in event of default rates and internal risk ratings 
o webster statistically evaluates the impact of larger concentrations in the commercial loan portfolio 
o comparable industry charge off statistics by line of business  broadly defined as residential  consumer  home equity and second mortgages  commercial real estate and commercial and industrial lending  are utilized as factors in calculating loss estimates in the loan portfolios 
o actual losses by portfolio segment are reviewed to validate estimated future probable losses 
allowance for loan losses at december   webster s allowance for loan losses was million  or of the total loan portfolio  and of total nonperforming loans 
this compares with an allowance of million or of the total loan portfolio  and of total nonperforming loans at december  a writedown of million to the allowance resulted from the sale or transfer to held for sale of five classified shared national telecommunication credits totaling million 
the million addition to the allowance for acquired loans resulted from the whitehall asset based loan acquisition 
net charge offs for totaled million as compared to million for reflecting an increase of million 
the increase was primarily the result of commercial loan net charge offs being million higher for equipment financing net charge offs increased by million to million  or of commercial net charge offs 
specialized lending net charge off increased by million to million or 
as management performed its review of the loan portfolio and the loan loss allowance  it considered various factors when determining the adequacy of the allowance 
this review included the specialized lending portfolio and the additional risks inherent in this portfolio 
based upon this review  management believes that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to cover probable losses in the loan portfolio

unlike most industrial companies  substantially all of the assets and liabilities of a banking institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates have a more significant impact on webster s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services
