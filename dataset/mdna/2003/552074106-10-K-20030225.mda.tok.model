the decline in net new home orders and

table of contents the company s ability to utilize the foregoing tax benefits will depend upon the amount of its future taxable income and may be further limited under certain circumstances 
although the company s certificate of incorporation includes transfer restrictions intended to help reduce the risk of an ownership change  transactions could have occurred that would severely limit the company s ability to have used the tax benefits associated with the net operating loss carryforwards 
the company learned that one stockholder unknowingly violated the transfer restrictions 
the stockholder divested itself of the requisite number of shares in february and march  so that it was no longer out of compliance with the company s certificate of incorporation 
pursuant to the certificate of incorporation  the transfer restrictions terminated on november  neither the amount of the net operating loss carryforwards nor the amount of limitation on such carryforwards claimed by the company has been audited or otherwise validated by the internal revenue service  and it could challenge either amount that the company has calculated

table of contents assessment district bonds in some jurisdictions in which the company develops and constructs property  assessment district bonds are issued by municipalities to finance major infrastructure improvements and fees 
such financing has been an important part of financing master planned communities due to the long term nature of the financing  favorable interest rates when compared to the company s other sources of funds and the fact that the bonds are sold  administered and collected by the relevant government entity 
as a landowner benefited by the improvements  the company is responsible for the assessments on its land 
when the company s homes or other properties are sold  the assessments are either prepaid or the buyers assume the responsibility for the related assessments

in periods of high inflation  demand for the company s homes may be reduced by increases in mortgage interest rates 
further  the company s profits will be affected by its ability to recover through higher sales prices increases in the costs of land  construction  labor and administrative expenses 
the company s ability to raise prices at such times will depend upon demand and other competitive factors 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and costs and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those which impact its most critical 
table of contents accounting policies 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes that the following accounting policies are among the most important to a portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and require among the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments real estate inventories and cost of sales real estate inventories are carried at cost net of impairment losses  if any 
real estate inventories consist primarily of deposits  raw land  lots under development  homes under construction and completed homes of real estate projects 
all direct and indirect land costs  offsite and onsite improvements and applicable interest and other carrying charges are capitalized to real estate projects during periods when the project is under development 
land  offsite costs and all other common costs are allocated to land parcels benefited based upon relative fair values before construction 
onsite construction costs and related carrying charges principally interest and property taxes are allocated to the individual homes within a phase based upon the relative sales value of the homes 
the estimation process involved in determining relative fair values and sales values is inherently uncertain because it involves estimates of current market values for land parcels before construction as well as future sales values of individual homes within a phase 
the company s estimate of future sales values is supported by the company s budgeting process 
the estimate of future sales values is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of current market conditions as well as future market events and conditions 
additionally  in determining the allocation of costs to a particular land parcel or individual home  the company relies on project budgets that are based on a variety of assumptions  including assumptions about construction schedules and future costs to be incurred 
it is possible that actual results could differ from budgeted amounts for various reasons  including construction delays  increases in costs which have not yet been committed  or unforeseen issues encountered during construction that fall outside the scope of contracts obtained 
while the actual results for a particular construction project are accurately reported over time  a variance between the budget and actual costs could result in the understatement or overstatement of costs and a related impact on gross margins in a specific reporting period 
to reduce the potential for such distortion  the company has set forth procedures which have been applied by the company on a consistent basis  including assessing and revising project budgets on a monthly basis  obtaining commitments from subcontractors and vendors for future costs to be incurred  reviewing the adequacy of warranty accruals and historical warranty claims experience  and utilizing the most recent information available to estimate costs 
the variances between budget and actual amounts identified by the company have historically not had a material impact on its consolidated results of operations 
management believes that the company s policies provide for reasonably dependable estimates to be used in the calculation and reporting of costs 
the company relieves its accumulated real estate inventories through cost of sales for the cost of homes sold  as described more fully below in the section entitled sales and profit recognition

statement no 
requires impairment losses to be recorded on assets to be held and used by the company when indicators of impairment are present and the undiscounted cash flows estimated to be generated by those assets are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
the estimation process used in determining the undiscounted cash flows of the assets is inherently uncertain because it involves estimates of future revenues and costs 
as described more fully above in the section entitled real estate inventories and cost of sales  estimates of revenues and costs are supported by the company s budgeting process 
when an impairment loss is required for assets to be held and used by the company  the related assets are adjusted to their estimated fair value 

table of contents fair value represents the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than a forced or liquidation sale 
the estimation process involved in determining if assets have been impaired and in the determination of fair value is inherently uncertain because it requires estimates of current market yields as well as future events and conditions 
such future events and conditions include economic and market conditions  as well as the availability of suitable financing to fund development and construction activities 
the realization of the company s real estate inventories is dependent upon future uncertain events and conditions and  accordingly  the actual timing and amounts realized by the company may be materially different from their estimated fair values
