table of contents ments included in this form k 
the following information contains forward looking statements which involve certain risks and uncertainties 
see forward looking statements 
general the company produces and markets fresh baked breads  rolls and snack foods and frozen baked breads and desserts 
sales are principally affected by pricing  quality  brand recognition  new product introductions and product line extensions  marketing and service 
the company manages these factors to achieve a sales mix favoring its higher margin branded products  while using private label products to control overhead costs and maximize use of production capacity 
effective july  the first day of the third quarter of fiscal  the company s two operating segments  flowers bakeries and mrs 
smith s bakeries  were restructured to form three operating segments 
these segments are flowers bakeries  mrs 
smith s bakeries and flowers snack 
flowers snack consists of the snack business previously operated by mrs 
smith s bakeries 
because mrs 
smith s bakeries and flowers snack historically shared certain administrative and division expenses  certain allocations and assumptions have been made in order to present comparative historical information for mrs 
smith s bakeries and flowers snack as separate segments 
in most instances  administrative and division expenses have been allocated between the two segments based on cases of product sold 
management believes that the amounts are reasonable estimations of the costs that would have been incurred had mrs 
smith s bakeries and flowers snack performed these functions as separate divisions 
the principal elements comprising the company s production costs are ingredients  packaging materials  labor and overhead 
the major ingredients used in the production of the company s products are flour  sugar  shortening  fruits and dairy products 
the company also uses paper products  such as corrugated cardboard  aluminum products  such as pie plates  and plastic  to package its products 
the prices of these materials are subject to significant volatility 
the company has mitigated the effects of such price volatility in the past through its hedging programs  but may not be successful in protecting itself from fluctuations in the future 
in addition to the foregoing factors  production costs are affected by the efficiency of production methods and capacity utilization 
the company s selling  marketing and administrative expenses are comprised mainly of distribution  logistics and advertising expenses 
distribution and logistics costs represent the largest component of the company s cost structure  other than production costs  and are principally influenced by changes in sales volume 
additionally  the independent distributors receive a percentage of the wholesale price of sales to retailers and other customers 
the company records these amounts as selling  marketing and administrative expense 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the company are comprised of depreciation of property  plant and equipment and amortization of certain costs in excess of net tangible assets associated with acquisitions 
the company does not allocate depreciation and amortization to cost of goods sold 
critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its results of operations and financial condition are based upon the consolidated financial statements of the company  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of the revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  bad debts  raw materials  inventories  long lived assets  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  pensions and other post retirement benefits and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of 
table of contents assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  derivative instruments  reserves for obsolescence and unmarketable inventory  valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles  deferred tax asset valuation allowance  and pension obligations 
revenue recognition 
the company recognizes revenue from the sale of its products at the time of delivery when title and risk of loss pass to the customer 
the company records estimated reductions to revenue for customer programs and incentive offerings  including special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives  at the time the incentive is offered or at the time of revenue recognition for the underlying transaction that results in progress by the customer towards earning the incentive 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase incentive offerings  possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue 
independent distributors receive a discount equal to a percentage of the wholesale price of product sold to retailers and other customers 
the company records such amounts as selling  marketing and administrative expenses 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to increase distributor discounts  possibly resulting in an incremental increase in selling  marketing and administrative expenses at the time the discount is offered 
the consumer packaged goods industry has utilized scan based trading technology over several years to share information between the supplier and retailer 
an extension of this technology allows the retailer to pay the supplier when the consumer purchases the goods rather than at the time they are delivered to the retailer 
this technology is referred to in the industry as pay by scan pbs 
during  the industry saw a sharp increase in the use of scan based trading 
in response to this demand  the company began a pilot program in fiscal  working with certain retailers to develop the technology to execute pbs 
the company believes it is an industry leader in pbs and is aggressively working with its larger customers  such as wal mart  winn dixie  kroger and food lion  to expand the use of pbs 
in fiscal  the company recorded approximately million in sales through pbs 
the company estimates that by the end of fiscal  it will have approximately million in pbs sales 
while pbs modestly delays the timing of revenue recognition  given the quick turn of our products  the company does not expect pbs to have a material adverse effect on reported revenues in any period 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from non payment by our customers 
while the company believes its current allowance for doubtful accounts is reasonable  if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
derivative instruments 
the company s cost of primary raw materials is highly correlated to the commodities markets 
commodities  such as our baking ingredients  experience price fluctuations 
from time to time  we enter into forward purchase agreements and derivative financial instruments to reduce the impact of volatility in raw material prices 
if actual market conditions become significantly different than those anticipated  raw material prices could increase significantly  adversely affecting our results of operations 
the company may from time to time enter into contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under gaap 
these contracts must  under gaap  be marked to market as of the end of each quarter  which may result in significant volatility in our results of operations 

table of contents reserves for obsolescence and unmarketable inventory 
the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
valuation of long lived assets  goodwill and other intangibles 
the company records an impairment charge to property  plant and equipment assets  goodwill and intangible assets in accordance with applicable accounting standards when  based on certain indicators of impairment  it believes such assets have experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of these underlying assets could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the asset that may not be reflected in the asset s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring impairment charges in the future 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
pension obligations 
the company records pension costs and the liabilities related to its defined benefit plan based on actuarial valuations 
these valuations include key assumptions determined by management  including the discount rate and expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the expected long term rate of return assumption considers the asset mix of the plan portfolio  past performance of these assets and other factors 
material changes in pension costs may occur in the future due to changes in these assumptions 
future annual amounts could be impacted by changes in the number of plan participants  changes in the discount rate  changes in the expected long term rate of return  changes in the level of contributions to the plan and other factors 
there are no new participants in the company s defined benefit plan as participation was frozen as of december  the company s fiscal pension expense was million 
the company expects its fiscal pension expense to increase by approximately million 
this increase is largely attributed to unrecognized losses on pension assets related to weakness in the equity markets 
a quarter percentage point change in the discount rate would impact the company s fiscal expense by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
a quarter percentage point change in the long term expected rate of return would impact the company s fiscal pension expense by approximately million on a pre tax basis 
during fiscal and fiscal  the company contributed million and million  respectively  to the defined benefit plan 
the company s pension plan assets have declined due to the recent weakness in the equity markets  while pension liabilities and benefit payments have continued to grow 
the value of the company s plan assets were below the accumulated benefit obligation abo at its most recent plan measurement date 
accounting rules require that  if the abo exceeds the fair value of pension plan assets  the employer must recognize a liability that is at least equal to the unfunded abo 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company recorded a minimum pension liability adjustment that impacted other comprehensive income by million  net of tax 
other comprehensive income captures certain items excluded from net income  such as unrealized gains or losses related to derivative financial instruments  as well as additional minimum pension liabilities not yet recognized in the consolidated statement of income as part of net pension cost 
other balance sheet accounts impacted include deferred tax assets increase of million  unfunded pension liability increase of million  and an intangible asset related to unrecognized prior service costs increase of million 
future pension contributions will depend on market conditions 
if weak market conditions persist  the company expects to make future cash contributions to the pension plan 
in assessing different scenarios  the company believes its strong cash flow and balance sheet will allow it to fund future pension needs without affecting the business strategy of the company

information regarding non gaap financial measures the company prepares its consolidated financial statements in accordance with gaap 
however  from time to time  the company may present in its public statements  press releases and sec filings  ebitda  a non gaap measure  to measure the performance of the company and its operating divisions 
the company defines ebitda as earnings from continuing operations before interest  income taxes  depreciation  amortization and unusual items 
the company believes that ebitda is a useful tool for managing the operations of its business and is an indicator of the company s ability to incur and service indebtedness and generate free cash flow 
furthermore  pursuant to the terms of our credit agreement  ebitda as adjusted in accordance with the credit agreement  is used to determine the company s compliance with certain financial covenants 
the company also believes that ebitda measures are commonly reported and widely used by investors and other interested parties as measures of a company s operating performance and debt servicing ability because they assist in comparing performance on a consistent basis without regard to depreciation or amortization  which 
table of contents can vary significantly depending upon accounting methods and nonoperating factors such as historical cost 
ebitda is also a widely accepted financial indicator of a company s ability to incur and service indebtedness 
ebitda should not be considered an alternative to a income from operations or net income loss as a measure of operating performance  b cash flows provided by operating  investing and financing activities as determined in accordance with gaap as a measure of the company s ability to meet its cash needs  or c any other indicator of performance or liquidity that has been determined in accordance with gaap

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company uses derivative financial instruments as part of an overall strategy to manage market risk 
the company uses forward  futures  swap and option contracts to hedge existing or future exposure to changes in interest rates and commodity prices 
the company does not enter into these derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  raw material prices could increase significantly  adversely affecting the margins from the sale of our products 
commodity price risk the company enters into commodity forward  futures and option contracts and swap agreements for wheat and  to a lesser extent  other commodities in an effort to provide a predictable and consistent commodity price and thereby reduce the impact of volatility in its raw material and packaging prices 
at december   the fair market value of the company s commodity derivative portfolio was a liability of million 
of this fair value  million is based on quoted market prices and million is based on models and other valuation methods 
additionally  of this fair value  million and million relate to instruments that will be utilized in fiscal and  respectively 
a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to commodity price risk 
based on the company s derivative portfolio as of december   a hypothetical ten percent adverse change in commodity prices under normal market conditions could potentially have a million effect on the fair value of the derivative portfolio 
the analysis disregards changes in the exposures inherent in the underlying hedged item  however  the company expects that any loss in fair value of the portfolio would be substantially offset by reductions in raw material and packaging prices 
interest rate risk the company enters into interest rate swap agreements in order to reduce its overall interest rate risk 
at december   the fair market value of the company s interest rate swaps was a liability of million 
the fair value of the swaps is based on a valuation model using quoted market prices 
most of this fair value is related to portions of instruments to be utilized in fiscal and an immaterial amount to portions of instruments to be utilized in fiscal a sensitivity analysis has been prepared to estimate the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
assuming a increase in interest rates  the fair value of the company s interest rate swap agreements at december   with a notional amount of million  would increase by million 
a decrease in interest rates would reduce the fair value by million 
based on the company s floating rate debt at december   including the effect of the interest rate swap agreements  assuming a increase in interest rates  the company s interest expense would increase by million  while the impact of a decrease in interest rates would reduce interest expense by million

 an amendment of sfas no 
 and sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment of sfas no 
 was adopted by the company on december  the first day of fiscal 
table of contents in accordance with sfas  all derivatives are recognized on the consolidated balance sheet in current or other assets or other accrued liabilities or other liabilities at their fair value 
on the date the company enters into a derivative contract  it designates the derivative as a hedge of the fair value of a a recognized asset or liability or b an unrecognized firm commitment a fair value hedge or a hedge of the variability of cash flows that are to be received or paid in connection with a a forecasted transaction or b a recognized asset or liability a cash flow hedge 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as  and that is designated and qualifies as  a fair value hedge  along with changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the hedged risk including changes that reflect losses or gains on firm commitments  are recorded in current period earnings 
changes in the fair value of a derivative that is highly effective as  and that is designated and qualifies as  a cash flow hedge  to the extent that the hedge is effective  are recorded in other comprehensive income  until earnings are affected by the variability of cash flows of the hedged transaction eg  until periodic settlements of a variable rate asset or liability are recorded in earnings or when the underlying commodity being hedged is used in production and recorded to earnings 
any hedge ineffectiveness which represents the amount by which the changes in the fair value of the derivative exceeds the variability in the cash flows of the forecasted transaction is recorded in current period earnings in selling  marketing and administrative expenses 
the company may from time to time enter into contracts that do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment under gaap 
these contracts must  under gaap  be marked to market as of the end of each quarter  which may result in significant volatility in our results of operations 
changes in the fair value of derivative instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are also reported in current period earnings in selling  marketing and administrative expenses 
while sfas provides a significant change in the accounting guidance related to derivative instruments and hedging activities  the company has determined that the more stringent accounting and documentation requirements under sfas do not cause any significant changes in its overall risk management strategy and in its overall hedging activities 
the cash effects of the company s commodity derivatives and interest rate swap are included in the consolidated statement of cash flows as cash flow from operating activities
