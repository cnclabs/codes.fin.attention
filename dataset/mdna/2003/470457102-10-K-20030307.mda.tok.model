item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
due to economic and competitive conditions experienced recently  we have substantially curtailed our plans to develop new inns and to expand existing inns 
during we sold three jameson inns and one signature inn which were mostly under performing and which no longer met our investment criteria 
we plan on selling additional jameson and signature inns in the future 
see policies and objectives with respect to certain activities dispositions 
we also continue to consider other strategic alternatives as a possible means of growth and increasing shareholder value 
these include acquisitions of other properties  business combinations  corporate restructuring  an offering of additional equity securities  termination of our election to be taxed as a reit and other alternatives 
we have made no decisions or commitments at this time  but we intend to continue to consider these alternatives 
development of new inns 
we believe that selective opportunities may still exist for the development of new jameson inns in certain markets in the southeastern united states 
although we have no current plans to begin new development of jameson inns  we will continue to evaluate opportunities as they arise in targeted communities 
at december   we had one twenty room jameson inn under expansion 
additionally  in the first quarter of  we plan to begin converting an existing signature inn located in louisville  ky to a jameson inn 
we are evaluating plans to convert certain existing signature inns to jameson inns  according to our assessment of market demand  cost and other relevant factors 
we have entered into agreements with best western to co brand three signature inn hotels to the best western flag  and operate as a best western signature inn 
we have an option to convert one additional signature inn under a similar arrangement with best western during we may consider other re flagging opportunities in the future although we have no obligation to do so 
expansion of existing jameson inns 
we expanded one jameson inn in january we may consider expanding additional existing jameson inns if market conditions and other circumstances warrant 
to date  we have expanded jameson inns 
since jameson inns built prior to were initially constructed with the office and lobby  swimming pool and fitness center on sites generally large enough for future expansions  the incremental cost per room of expansions is lower than for new inn construction 
accordingly  we have been able to earn returns on the investment by expanding jameson inns in markets with strong room demand 
also  as compared to the development of new inns  expansion of existing jameson inns has been a relatively lower risk growth strategy since we have an opportunity to assess local room demand and market trends based on our direct experience in developing and owning the existing hotel 
we employ substantially the same strategy regarding possible expansion of our currently operating exterior corridor jameson inns 
the sites for new  interior corridor jameson inns  however  and all of the current signature inn sites are fully developed and these properties cannot be expanded 
kitchin hospitality as contractor 
we anticipate that kitchin hospitality will continue to act as general contractor for any new inns we build  for expansions  refurbishments and other capital expenditures with respect to existing jameson inns and signature inns 
each construction contract for a new inn or a group of inns provides for a turnkey price for all work performed under the contract subject to reduction  if kitchin hospitality s profits as defined in the construction contract exceed 
the contract price excludes the cost of the land and closing costs  but includes the costs of constructing and equipping the inns  including interest charges we incur on the associated construction debt during construction and working with kitchin hospitality to staff the inn prior to opening 
each contract for refurbishment and other capital expenditures provides for us to pay the actual cost of the work plus a contractor s fee 
an independent architectural firm engaged by the company reviews each construction contract and each is also subject to approval by a majority of our independent directors 
the average price charged by kitchin hospitality for the new jameson inn opened during and the four jameson inns expanded in was approximately  per guest room 
internal growth 
through percentage rent  we can participate in increases in room revenues generated through increases in occupancy rates and average daily room rates or adr of the inns by kitchin hospitality 
total rent payable under the jameson lease  including base rent and percentage rent  is limited  however  for each calendar year to of jameson inn room revenues 
kitchin hospitality practices market sensitive pricing  increasing room rates at particular inns as market conditions in the specific communities warrant 
the inns general managers receive a significant portion of their compensation based on achieving specified quarterly operating results 
sales and marketing 
kitchin hospitality is responsible for marketing the inns 
it focuses on local efforts directed to the business community in the city or town where the particular inn is located 
one of the key responsibilities of an inn s general manager is to make sales calls on local chambers of commerce  businesses  factories  government installations and colleges and universities 
the goal of the sales call is to familiarize local business people with the inn in their community and solicit their recommendation of the inn to business travelers visiting communities where inns are located  including both individual discretionary travelers as well as groups attending family or community events 
kitchin hospitality employs billboards and other similar types of advertising and has two numbers to facilitate reservations for the inns 
all jameson inns and signatures have direct links to global distribution systems gds for reservations which also interfaces with major electronic reservation systems such as sabre  apollo  worldspan  system one and amadeus 
this interface connects the jameson and signature inns with travel agents nationally and internationally 
in addition to billboard advertising which kitchin hospitality has traditionally utilized and will continue to utilize  kitchin hospitality places advertisements for the inns in regional and special event publications and in newspapers 
kitchin hospitality also markets the inns through the website www 
jamesoninns 
com 
competition 
the hotel industry remains highly competitive 
each of the inns is located in an area that has competing hotels 
the number of competitive hotels in a particular area could have a material adverse effect on occupancy  adr  and revenue per available room  or revpar  of the inns 
many of our inns are located in cities and communities in which significant new hotel and motel development has occurred in recent years 
the inns compete mainly on the basis of price  quality and perceived value 
competition for the inns is made up primarily of limited service hotels in the southeastern and midwestern united states operating under national franchises  many of which have greater financial resources than we do  substantial advertising budgets  national reservation systems  marketing programs  guest reward programs and greater name recognition 
regulations environmental matters 
under various federal  state  and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real property may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of hazardous or toxic substances on  under or in such property 
such laws often impose liability whether or not the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
in addition  the presence of hazardous or toxic substances  or the failure to properly remediate such property  may adversely affect the owner s ability to borrow using the real property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at the disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person 
while we have not incurred any such costs in connection with our ownership of the inns or land parcels  we may be potentially liable for such costs 
we are not aware of any potential material liability or claims for which we may be responsible 
however  we cannot be certain that there are no material claims or liabilities related to real property which we own  future laws  ordinances or regulations will not impose any material environmental liability on us  or the current environmental condition of the inns will not be affected by their operations  by the condition of properties in the vicinity of the inns such as the presence of underground storage tanks or by third parties 
under the terms of the master leases  we indemnify kitchin hospitality against environmental liabilities  except those caused by the acts or negligent failures of kitchin hospitality 
in addition  the master leases provide that kitchin hospitality will indemnify us against environmental liabilities caused by kitchin hospitality s acts or negligent failures  although kitchin hospitality s financial condition may limit the value of such indemnity and  in any event  such indemnity will not apply to or protect us against past unknown violations and related liabilities 
see the master leases  above 
we believe that the inns are in compliance in all material respects with all federal  state and local ordinances and regulations regarding hazardous or toxic substances and do not anticipate that we will be required in the foreseeable future to expend any material amounts in order to comply with such ordinances and regulations 
we have not been notified by any governmental authority  and are not otherwise aware  of any material noncompliance  liability or claim relating to hazardous or toxic substances in connection with any of our present or former properties 
americans with disabilities act 
under the americans with disabilities act of or the ada  all public accommodations are required to meet certain federal requirements related to access and use by disabled persons 
in addition to remedial costs  noncompliance with the ada could result in imposition of fines or an award of damages to private litigants 
we believe that all existing inns are substantially in compliance with these requirements and we intend to construct future inns in accordance with such requirements as well 
we have engaged disabilities consultants at various times to make recommendations regarding compliance of the inns with the ada 
these consultants submitted reports recommending a number of improvements for access to and use by disabled persons with respect to certain of the inns in operation  which improvements were made 
we have also incorporated the consultants recommendations into the construction of new jameson inns and will continue to do so 
employees at december   we employed persons 
our employees are also employees of kitchin hospitality 
under the cost reimbursement agreement between jameson and kitchin hospitality  we reimburse kitchin hospitality for the time and for other general and administrative costs that these shared employees spend on our business 
for the year ended december   our reimbursement to kitchin hospitality totaled approximately  none of our or kitchin hospitality s employees is represented by a union or labor organization  nor have our or kitchin hospitality s operations ever been interrupted by a work stoppage 
we consider relations with our employees to be excellent

policies and objectives with respect to certain activities the following is a discussion of our investment objectives and policies  financing policies and policies with respect to certain other activities 
these policies may be amended or revised from time to time at the sole discretion of our board of directors 
we can give no assurance that we will attain our investment objectives or that the value of jameson will not decrease 
investment objectives and policies 
our investment objective is to provide quarterly cash distributions and achieve long term capital appreciation through increases in cash flow and the value of jameson 
we will seek to accomplish these objectives through the ownership and leasing of the inns to kitchin hospitality  increases in the inns room revenues and selective development and expansion of inns 
a key criterion for new investments will be the opportunity they offer for growth in funds from operations and cash available for distribution 
for definitions  calculation of funds from operations and cash available from operations and related disclosures  see item jameson management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we currently intend to invest only in jameson inns and signature inns  although we may also hold temporary cash investments from time to time pending investment or distribution to stockholders 
we may purchase or lease properties for long term investment  expand and improve properties  or sell such properties  in whole or in part  when circumstances warrant 
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness which have priority over our equity interest 
while we emphasize equity real estate investments  we may  in our discretion  invest in mortgages  stock of other reits and other real estate interests 
mortgage investments may include participating or convertible mortgages 
however  we have not invested previously in mortgages or stock of other reits  and do not presently intend to do so 
dispositions 
during  we sold three room jameson inns 
one signature inn located in cincinnati  ohio was sold in february one additional signature inn was classified as held for sale at december  and was sold in january while we have presently made no commitments to sell any other jameson inns or signature inns we may identify additional inns to dispose of which do not meet our investment criteria 
we do not expect the combined sales of these properties to result in a significant gain or loss 
financing 
our policy has been to finance all of the costs of developing new inns and expanding existing inns 
indebtedness we incur may be in the form of bank borrowings  secured and unsecured  and publicly and privately placed debt instruments 
indebtedness may be recourse to all or any part of our inns or may be limited to the inn to which the indebtedness relates 
we may also use the proceeds from any of our borrowings for the payment of distributions  for working capital  to refinance existing indebtedness or to finance acquisitions  expansions or development of new inns 
most of our current mortgage indebtedness is with recourse to us 
at december   we had outstanding an aggregate of approximately million of mortgage debt  including  in construction debt drawn for the one expansion in progress 
for this inn expansion in progress  the construction debt provides for additional borrowings of  and is secured by this expansion 
while our organizational documents do not limit the amount or percentage of indebtedness that we may incur  we currently have a policy of limiting outstanding indebtedness for new construction  expansions and refinancings to of the aggregate value of the inns based on the most recent appraisals obtained on the inns 
our board of directors could change our current policies and we could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increased risk of default on our obligations and in an increase in debt service requirements 
this increase could adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations  our ability to make dividend distributions to our stockholders and could  as a result  jeopardize our status as a reit 
we may attempt to raise additional equity capital for working capital purposes or the repayment of indebtedness 
in the event we desire to raise additional equity capital  our board of directors has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue additional shares of jameson common stock or other capital stock of jameson in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
existing stockholders would have no preemptive right to purchase shares issued in any offering  and any such offering might cause a dilution of a stockholder s investment in jameson 
working capital reserves 
our policy is to maintain working capital reserves and when not sufficient  access to borrowings in amounts that our board of directors determines to be adequate to meet normal contingencies in connection with the operation of our business and investments 
policy regarding capital expenditures 
in july  we adopted a policy of maintaining cash or sufficient access to borrowings equal to of the jameson inns aggregate room revenues since july   less amounts actually spent from that date forward for capital expenditures 
this policy extends to the signature inns acquired in may for the period july  through december   our actual expenditures for these purposes have exceeded these amounts as of room revenues equaled million and we expended million on items during that same period 
other policies 
we intend to operate in a manner that will not subject us to regulation under the investment company act of we do not intend to invest in the securities of other issuers for the purpose of exercising control over such issuer  underwrite securities of other issuers or actively trade in loans or other investments 
we may make investments other than as previously described  although we presently have no plans to do so 
during the past five years  except in connection with the acquisition of billboard assets from kitchin hospitality and the signature merger  we have not issued jameson common stock or any other securities in exchange for property  nor have we reacquired any of our common stock 
options held by officers and employees of the company and kitchin hospitality to purchase  shares of our common stock were canceled voluntarily in jameson has authority to issue common stock and other securities and to reacquire our common stock and other securities and may do so in the future 
during the last five years  we have not engaged in trading  underwriting or agency distribution or sale of securities of other issuers  and we do not intend to do so in the future 
our board of directors may review and modify our policies with respect to such activities from time to time without the vote of the stockholders 
at all times  we intend to make investments in such a manner as to be consistent with the requirements of the internal revenue code to qualify as a reit unless our board of directors  with the consent of our stockholders  determines to revoke our reit election 
conflicts of interest 
because of the ownership by thomas w 
kitchin in and positions with jameson and kitchin hospitality  there are inherent conflicts of interest in the construction of new jameson inns and signature inns and the expansion  refurbishment and other capital expenditures relating to existing inns by kitchin hospitality 
conflicts of interest also exist in our dealings with kitchin hospitality under the master leases  the construction and refurbishing contracts and under the cost reimbursement agreement between the two companies 
see the master leases  growth plans for  kitchin hospitality as contractor  and employees 
in an effort to reduce the conflicts of interest  we have a policy of requiring that any material transaction or arrangement between us and kitchin hospitality  or an affiliate of either  is subject to approval by a majority of our independent directors 
our board of directors also has a policy that any material contract or transaction between us and one or more of our directors or officers  or between us and any other entity in which one or more of our directors or officers are directors or officers or have a financial interest must be approved by a majority of either our independent directors or disinterested shareholders after the material facts as to the relationship or interest and as to the contract or transaction are disclosed or are known to them 
the board of directors may change this policy without the consent of the shareholders upon the affirmative vote of a majority of our independent directors 
taxation of jameson we made an election to be taxed as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code  commencing with our taxable year beginning january  we believe that commencing with the taxable year  we were organized and we have operated in such a manner as to qualify for taxation as a reit under the internal revenue code 
however  we cannot guarantee that we have operated in a manner  or will operate in a manner in the future  so as to remain qualified as a reit 
the sections of the internal revenue code relating to qualification and operation as a reit are highly technical and complex 
the following discussion summarizes the material aspects of the internal revenue code sections that govern the federal income tax treatment of a reit and its shareholders 
because it is a summary  it does not cover all aspects of this subject 
to understand all of the rules and regulations applicable to us as a reit  you should refer to the applicable internal revenue code provisions  treasury regulations and administrative and judicial interpretations thereof 
as long as we qualify for taxation as a reit  we generally will not be subject to federal corporate income tax on our net income that is currently distributed to our shareholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and shareholder levels that generally results from investment in a corporation 
however  we will be subject to federal income or excise tax as follows first  we will be taxed at regular corporate rates on our reit taxable income  which is defined generally as taxable income subject to certain adjustments  including net capital gains  less dividends or certain deemed dividends paid to shareholders 
second  we will generally be subject to the alternative minimum tax if reit taxable income plus any tax adjustments and preferences is greater than dividends paid to shareholders 
third  if we have net income from the sale or other disposition of foreclosure property which is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade of business or other non qualifying net income from foreclosure property  we will be subject to tax at the highest corporate rate on such income 
fourth  if we have net income from prohibited transactions generally certain sales or other dispositions of property other than foreclosure property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of business  this income will be subject to a tax 
fifth  if we should fail to satisfy the or gross income tests discussed below and have nonetheless maintained our qualification as a reit because certain other requirements have been met  we will be subject to a tax on the net income attributable to the greater of the amount by which we fail the or gross income tests 
sixth  generally  if we fail to distribute to our shareholders during each calendar year an amount equal to our required distribution  we will be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution amount over the amount actually distributed for the year 
the amount of required distribution is equal to the sum of of our ordinary income for such year  of our reit capital gain net income for such year and the amount  if any  of the required distribution for the previous year over the amount actually distributed for that year 
in addition  if during the year period the recognition period beginning on the first day of the first taxable year for which we qualified as a reit  we recognize gain on the disposition of any asset held by us as of the beginning of such recognition period  then  to the extent of the excess of the fair market value of such asset as of the beginning of such recognition period over our adjusted basis in such asset as of the beginning of the recognition period the built in gain  such built in gain  which may be reduced by certain net operating loss carryforwards  will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate 
the recognition period began january   and will expire december  further  if we acquire any asset from a c corporation in a transaction in which the basis of the asset in our hands is determined by reference to the basis of the asset or any other property in the hands of the c corporation such as our acquisition of signature inns by reason of our acquisition of signature inns  inc on may   and we recognize gain on the disposition of such asset during the ten year period beginning on the date on which such asset was acquired by us  then  to the extent of the built in gain  such gain will be subject to tax at the highest regular corporate rate 
the amount of our built in gain based on the appraisals obtained in connection with our initial public offering in is approximately million 
the amount of our built in gain attributable to the signature inns acquisition is less than million 
as a result of our disposition of inns during and  we realized built in gains of million 
these built in gains and the associated federal income taxes were not recognized in or  but have been deferred until we are in a net taxable income position  at which time  the built in gain will be offset by the net operating loss carry forward of million 
requirements for qualification the internal revenue code defines a reit as a corporation  trust or association which is managed by one or more trustees or directors  the beneficial ownership of which is evidenced by transferable shares or by transferable certificates of beneficial interest  which would be taxable as a domestic corporation  but for sections through of the internal revenue code  which is neither a financial institution nor an insurance company subject to certain provisions of the internal revenue code  the beneficial ownership of which is held by or more persons  at any time during the last half of each taxable year not more than in value of the outstanding stock of which is owned  directly or indirectly  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities  which makes an election to be a reit and satisfies all relevant filing and other administrative requirements established by the irs that must be met in order to elect and maintain reit status  which uses a calendar year for federal income tax purposes and complies with the record keeping requirements of the internal revenue code and treasury regulations promulgated thereunder  and which meets certain other tests  described below  regarding the nature of its income and assets 
the internal revenue code provides that conditions to  inclusive  must be met during the entire taxable year and that condition must be met during at least days of a taxable year of months  or during a proportionate part of a taxable year of less than months 
we believe that we have met since we became a publicly held company  and that we currently do meet  all of such definitional requirements 
income tests in order for us to maintain our qualification as a reit  we must satisfy two gross income tests annually 
first  at least of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must consist of defined types of income derived directly or indirectly from investments relating to real property or mortgages on real property including rents from real property and  in certain circumstances  interest or qualified temporary investment income 
second  at least of our gross income excluding gross income from prohibited transactions for each taxable year must be derived from such real property or temporary investments  and from dividends and other types of interest and gain from the sale or disposition of stock or securities 
rents received by us under the master leases with kitchin hospitality will qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income requirements for a reit described above only if several conditions are met 
first  the amount of rent must not be based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person 
however  an amount received or accrued generally will not be excluded from the term rents from real property solely by reason of being based on a fixed percentage or percentages of receipts or sales 
therefore  the percentage rent provisions of the master leases should not disqualify rental income received from kitchin hospitality 
second  the internal revenue code provides that rents received from a tenant  directly or indirectly  will not qualify as rents from real property in satisfying the gross income tests if the reit  or a direct or indirect owner of or more of the reit  directly or constructively owns or more of such tenant a related party tenant 
we believe that since january   we have satisfied  and we will use our best efforts to continue to satisfy this requirement 
kitchin hospitality is not and should not become a related party tenant of jameson by reason of our adherence to the ownership limit and the related party limit set forth in our articles of incorporation 
third  if rent attributable to personal property  leased in connection with a lease of real property  is greater than of the total rent received under the lease  then the portion of rent attributable to such personal property will not qualify as rents from real property 
applicable internal revenue code provisions provide that with respect to each lease  rent attributable to the personal property for the taxable year is that amount which bears the same ratio to total rent as the average of a reit s fair market value of all personal property at the beginning and at the end of each taxable year bears to the average of the reit s aggregate fair market value of all real and personal property at the beginning and at the end of such taxable year 
we have confirmed by numerical testing that the resulting rental income attributable to personal property since january  has been less than 
we monitor these tests regularly 
if we project that for any inn for any taxable year the resulting rental income attributable to personal property may exceed of all rental income  a portion of the personal property of that inn may be sold by us to kitchin hospitality  with the lease payments adjusted accordingly 
finally  for rents received to qualify as rents from real property  the reit generally must not operate or manage the leased property or furnish or render services to the tenants of such property  other than through an independent contractor from whom the reit derives no revenue  provided  however  we may directly perform certain services other than services which are considered rendered to the occupant of the property 
we have not  do not and will not knowingly charge rent for any property that is based in whole or in part on the income or profits of any person except by reason of being based on a percentage of receipts or sales  as described above  rent any property to a related party tenant  lease personal property in connection with the rental of any inn which would cause the rental income attributable to such personal property to exceed of the amount of total rental income from such property  or iv perform services considered to be rendered for the occupants of the inns other than through an independent contractor 
under the master leases  kitchin hospitality has leased the land  buildings  improvements  furnishings  and equipment comprising the inns from us 
kitchin hospitality pays us a per room rent base rent plus additional rent based on a percentage of the gross room rental revenues percentage rent  with the total of the base rent and percentage rent being called total rent 
in order for the total rent to constitute rents from real property  the leases must be respected as true leases for federal income tax purposes and not treated as service contracts  joint venture or some other type of arrangement 
the determination of whether the leases are true leases depends on an analysis of all of the surrounding facts and circumstances 
in addition  pursuant to section e of the internal revenue code  a service contract  partnership agreement  or some other type of arrangement may be treated instead as a lease of property if the contract  agreement or arrangement is properly treated as a lease of property  taking into account all relevant factors  including whether or not the service recipient is in physical possession of the property  the service recipient controls the property  the service recipient has a significant economic or possessory interest in the property eg  the property s use is likely to be dedicated to the service recipient for a substantial portion of the useful life of the property  the service recipient shares the risk that the property will decline in value  the service recipient shares in any appreciation in the value of the property  the service recipient shares in savings in the property s operating costs  or the service recipient bears the risk of damage to or loss of the property  the service provider does not bear any risk of substantially diminished receipts or substantially increased expenditures if there is nonperformance under the lease  the service provider does not use the property concurrently to provide significant services to entities unrelated to the service recipient and the contract price does not substantially exceed the rental value of the property for the term of the lease 
under the master leases  kitchin hospitality has the right to exclusive possession  use and quiet enjoyment of the inns during the term of the master leases  kitchin hospitality bears the cost of  and is responsible for daily maintenance and repair of the inns  other than the cost of maintaining underground utilities and structural elements including the roofs of the improvements  kitchin hospitality dictates how the inns are operated  maintained  and improved and bears all of the costs and expenses of operating the inns including the cost of any inventory used in their operation during the term of the leases other than real and personal property taxes  casualty  liability and other types of insurance and equipment and the maintenance of structural elements  roofs and underground utilities  kitchin hospitality benefits from any savings in the costs of operating the inns during the term of the leases  in the event of damage or destruction to an inn  kitchin hospitality is at economic risk because it will be obligated to restore the property to its prior condition and bear all costs of such restoration in excess of any insurance proceeds except  under certain circumstances  during the last six months of the term of the master leases  kitchin hospitality has indemnified us against all liabilities imposed on us during the term of the master leases by reason of injury to persons or damage to property occurring at the inns or due to kitchin hospitality s use  management  maintenance or repair of the inns  and kitchin hospitality is obligated to pay substantial fixed rent for the term of the leases 
pursuant to irs revenue ruling  if one or more of the following conditions were present  the master leases would instead be considered as conditional contracts for purchase and sale of the inns portions of the periodic payments are made specifically applicable to an equity interest in the property to be acquired by kitchin hospitality  kitchin hospitality will acquire title upon the payment of a stated amount of rentals under the contract which it is required to make  the total amount which kitchin hospitality is required to pay for a relatively short period of use constitutes an inordinately large proportion of the total sum required to be paid to secure the transfer of the title  the agreed rental payments materially exceed the current fair rental value  the property may be acquired under a purchase option at a price which is nominal in relation to the value of the property at the time when the option may be exercised  as determined at the time of entering into the original agreement  or which is a relatively small amount when compared with the total payments which are required to be made  and some portion of the periodic payments is specifically designated as interest or is otherwise readily recognizable as the equivalent of interest 
under the master leases  no portion of the total rent has been or will be applied to any equity interest in the inns to be acquired by kitchin hospitality  kitchin hospitality has not acquired and will not be acquiring title to the inns upon the payment of a stated amount of either base rent or percentage rent  the total rent does not and will not materially exceed the current fair rental value of the inns  the inns may not be acquired by kitchin hospitality under a purchase option and no portion of either base rent or percentage rent has been or will be specifically designated as interest or will be recognizable as the equivalent of interest 
we believe that the master leases will be treated as true leases for federal income tax purposes 
however  the irs could challenge the tax treatment of the master leases  and  if it does  it could be successful 
if the master leases are recharacterized as a service contract  partnership agreement  or some other type of arrangement rather than a true lease  part or all of the payments that we receive from kitchin hospitality may not satisfy the various requirements for qualification as rents from real property 
in that case  we likely would not be able to satisfy either the or gross income tests and  as a result  would fail to qualify as a reit 
any gross income derived from a prohibited transaction is subject to a tax 
the term prohibited transaction generally includes a sale or other disposition of property other than foreclosure property that is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
none of our assets are or have been held for sale to customers in the ordinary course of our business and we will not sell an inn or associated property in the ordinary course of our business 
we sold four inns during because those inns were under performing 
kitchin hospitality advised that its projections for those inns indicated marginal results 
the sale of inns by us is extraordinary and we do not consider the sale of those inns as a part of our business 
whether property is held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business depends  however  on the facts and circumstances in effect from time to time  including those related to a particular property 
nevertheless  we have since january  complied with and we will attempt to continue to comply with the terms of the safe harbor provisions in the internal revenue code prescribing when asset sales will not be characterized as prohibited transactions 
complete assurance cannot be given  however  that we can comply with the safe harbor provisions of the internal revenue code or avoid owning property that may be characterized as property held primarily for sale to customers in the ordinary course of a trade or business 
if we fail to satisfy one or both of the or gross income tests for any taxable year  we may nevertheless qualify as a reit for such year if we are entitled to relief under certain provisions of the internal revenue code 
these relief provisions will generally be available if our failure to meet such tests is due to reasonable cause and not due to willful neglect  we attach a schedule of the sources of our gross income to our return  and any incorrect information on such schedule was not due to fraud with intent to evade tax 
we cannot state  however  whether in all circumstances we would be entitled to the benefit of these relief provisions 
as discussed above  even if these relief provisions apply  a tax would be imposed which would be equal to the excess of or of our gross income over our qualifying income in the relevant category  whichever is greater  multiplied by the ratio that reit taxable income bears to gross income for the taxable year with certain adjustments 
asset tests at the close of each quarter of our taxable year  we must also satisfy three tests relating to the nature of our assets 
first  at least of the value of our total assets must be represented by real estate assets which means real property including interests in real property and interests in mortgages on real property  shares in other reit s  stock or debt instruments held for not more than one year purchased with the proceeds of a stock offering or long term at least five years debt offering of the company  and cash  cash items including receivables and government securities 
second  not more than of our total assets may be represented by securities other than those in the asset class 
third  of the investments included in the asset class  the value of any one issuer s securities owned by us may not exceed of the value of our total assets and we may not own more than of the total voting power of the outstanding securities of any one issuer nor of the total value of the outstanding securities of any one issuer 
we have satisfied these asset tests since december   and we will use our best efforts to continue to satisfy such tests in the future 
after meeting the assets tests at the close of any quarter  we will not lose our status as a reit for failure to satisfy the asset tests at the end of a later quarter solely by reason of changes in asset values 
if the failure to satisfy the asset tests results from an acquisition of securities or other property during a quarter  the failure can be cured by disposition of sufficient non qualifying assets within days after the close of that quarter 
we maintain adequate records of the value of our assets to ensure compliance with the asset test and we intend to take such other action within days after the close of any quarter as may be required to cure any noncompliance 
however  this action may not always be successful 
annual distribution requirements in order to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our shareholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and any net capital gain and of our net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus b the sum of certain items of noncash income 
in addition  if we dispose of any asset during our recognition period  we will be required to distribute at least of the built in gain after tax  if any  recognized on the disposition of such asset 
such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and if paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain and all of our reit taxable income  as adjusted  we will be subject to tax thereon at regular corporate tax rates 
furthermore  if we should fail to distribute our required distribution described in the first sentence of this paragraph during each calendar year  we would be subject to a nondeductible excise tax on the excess of such required distribution over the amounts actually distributed 
since january   we have made  and we hereafter will make  timely distributions sufficient to satisfy all annual distribution requirements 
however  it is possible that  from time to time  we may experience timing differences between the actual receipt of income and actual payment of deductible expenses and the inclusion of that income and deduction of such expenses in arriving at our reit taxable income 
therefore  we could have less cash available for distribution than would be necessary to meet our annual distribution requirement or to avoid federal corporate income tax with respect to capital gain or the nondeductible excise tax imposed on certain undistributed income 
to meet the distribution requirement necessary to qualify as a reit or to avoid federal income tax with respect to capital gain or the excise tax  it could be necessary for us to borrow funds 
under certain circumstances  we may be able to rectify a failure to meet the distribution requirement for a year by paying dividends to shareholders in a later year 
if we declare a dividend before the date on which our tax return is due for a taxable year including extensions and distribute the amount of such dividend to shareholders in the month period following the close of such taxable year  such subsequent year dividend may be deductible in computing our reit taxable income for the immediately preceding year 
the distribution of such dividend must be made no later than the date of the first regular dividend payment made after the declaration and distribution of such dividend and we must elect such treatment in our return 
shareholders receiving subsequent year distributions are taxable on such distributions in the year of actual receipt except in the following case 
any distributions we declare in october  november or december of any year payable to a shareholder of record on a specified date in any such month shall be treated as both paid by us and received by the shareholder on december  provided that the distribution is actually paid during january of the following calendar year 
however  if we actually pay the declared distributions before december  the distributions will be treated as both paid by us and received by the shareholders on the actual dates paid and received  respectively 
if  as a result of an audit by the irs  the reit taxable income for a prior taxable year is increased  we may elect to distribute an additional deficiency dividend  as defined under section of the internal revenue code  and claim an additional deduction for dividends paid for such taxable year in order to meet the annual distribution requirement 
all deficiency dividends must be distributed within days after the final determination of an audit  and the claim for such deficiency dividends must be filed within days of such determination 
we would also be liable for the payment of interest charges on the amount of the deficiency dividend 
however  the payment of such dividends would ensure that our qualification as a reit would not be jeopardized due to a failure to meet our annual distribution requirement 
failure to qualify if we fail to qualify for taxation as a reit in any taxable year  and the relief provisions do not apply  we will be subject to tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at regular corporate rates 
distributions to shareholders in any year in which we fail to qualify will not be deductible by us nor will they be required to be made 
in such event  to the extent of current and accumulated earnings and profits  all distributions to shareholders will be taxable as ordinary income  and  subject to certain limitations of the internal revenue code  corporate distributees may be eligible for the dividends received deduction such deduction is not available to corporate distributees so long as we qualify as a reit 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we will also be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which we ceased to qualify as a reit 
taxation of shareholders tax consequences to non tax exempt us shareholders 
as long as we qualify as a reit  distributions made to our taxable us shareholders from current or accumulated earnings and profits and not designated as capital gain dividends will be taken into account by such us shareholders as ordinary income in the year they are received and will not be eligible for the dividends received deduction for corporations 
such distributions will be treated as portfolio income and not as income from passive activities 
accordingly  shareholders will not be able to apply any passive losses against such income 
distributions that are designated as capital gain dividends will be taxed as long term capital gains to the extent they do not exceed our actual net capital gain for the taxable year without regard to the period for which a shareholder has held our stock 
however  corporate shareholders may be required to treat up to of certain capital gain dividends as ordinary income 
distributions in excess of current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a us shareholder to the extent such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of such us shareholder s shares  but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares 
to the extent that our distribution exceeds our accumulated earnings and profits and the adjusted basis of a us shareholder s shares  such distributions will be included in income as long term capital gain or short term capital gain if the shares have been held for one year or less assuming the shares are held as a capital asset by the us shareholder 
shareholders may not include in their income tax returns any net operating losses or capital losses of the company 
finally  in general  any loss upon a sale or exchange of shares by a shareholder who has held such shares for more than one year after applying certain holding period rules will be treated as a long term capital loss to the extent of distributions from us required to be treated by such shareholder as long term capital gain 
in determining the extent to which a distribution on the series a preferred stock or series s preferred stock constitutes a dividend for tax purposes  our earnings and profits will be allocated  on a pro rata basis  first to distributions with respect to the series a preferred stock and the series s preferred stock  and then to the common stock 
under the internal revenue code we are permitted to make an election to treat all or a portion of our undistributed net capital gain as if it had been distributed to our shareholders 
if we were to make such an election  our shareholders would be required to include in their income as long term capital gain their proportionate share of our undistributed net capital gain  as we designated 
each of our shareholders would be deemed to have paid his proportionate share of our income tax with respect to such undistributed net capital gain  and this amount would be credited or refunded to the shareholder 
in addition  the tax basis of the shareholder s stock would be increased by his or her proportionate share of undistributed net capital gain included in his or her income less his or her proportionate share of our income tax with respect to such gains 
with respect to distributions we designate as capital gain dividends  we may designate subject to certain limits whether the dividend is taxable to shareholders as a rate gain distribution or as an unrecaptured depreciation distribution taxed at a rate 
information reporting requirements and backup withholding 
we will report to our us shareholders and the irs the amount of distributions paid during each calendar year and the amount of tax withheld  if any 
under the backup withholding rules  a us shareholder may be subject to backup withholding at the rate of with respect to distributions paid unless such holder a is a corporation or comes within certain other exempt categories and  when required  demonstrates this fact  or b provides a taxpayer identification number  certifies as to no loss of exemption from backup withholding and otherwise complies with applicable requirements of the backup withholding rules 
a shareholder that does not provide us with his correct taxpayer identification number may also be subject to penalties imposed by the irs 
any amount paid as backup withholding will be creditable against the shareholder s income tax liability 
in addition  we may be required to withhold a portion of capital gain distributions to any shareholders who fail to certify their non foreign status to us 
see below taxation of non us shareholders 
taxation of tax exempt shareholders 
distributions to a us shareholder that is a tax exempt entity should not constitute unrelated business taxable income as defined in section a of the internal revenue code ubti  provided that the tax exempt entity has not financed the acquisition of our shares with acquisition indebtedness within the meaning of section c of the internal revenue code and the shares are not otherwise used in an unrelated trade or business of the tax exempt entity 
in addition  if we are considered to be a pension held reit  then a portion of the dividends paid to qualified trusts any trust defined under section a of the internal revenue code and exempt from tax under section a of the internal revenue code that owns more than percent by value in the reit may be considered ubti 
in general  a pension held reit is a reit that is held by at least one qualified trust holding more than by value of the interests in the reit or by one or more qualified trusts each of whom owns more than by value holding in the aggregate more than by value of the interests in the reit 
we are not currently a pension held reit 
taxation of non us shareholders 
the rules governing united states federal income taxation of nonresident alien individuals  foreign corporations  foreign partnerships and other foreign shareholders collectively  non us shareholders are complex and we will make no attempt herein to provide more than a summary of such rules 
the treasury department issued new final regulations relating to withholding  information reporting and backup withholding on us source income paid to foreign persons including  for example  dividends we pay to our foreign shareholders 
these regulations generally are effective with respect to payments made after december   subject to certain transition rules 
we urge prospective investors to consult their own tax advisors as to the effect  if any  of the final regulations on their purchase  ownership and disposition of shares of common stock 
distributions to non us shareholders that are not attributable to gain from sales or exchanges by us of united states real property interests and not designated by us as capital gains dividends will be treated as dividends of ordinary income to the extent their source is our current or accumulated earnings and profits 
such distributions will ordinarily be subject to a withholding tax equal to of the gross amount of the distribution unless an applicable tax treaty reduces or eliminates that tax 
however  if income from a non us shareholder s investment in our stock is treated as effectively connected with the non us shareholder s conduct of a united states trade or business  the non us shareholder generally will be subject to a tax at graduated rates  in the same manner as us shareholders are taxed with respect to such distributions and may also be subject to the branch profits tax in the case of a shareholder that is a foreign corporation 
we expect to withhold united states income tax at the rate of on the gross amount of any such distributions made to a non us shareholder unless a lower treaty rate applies or the non us shareholder files an irs form w with us claiming that the distribution is effectively connected income within the meaning of section of the internal revenue code 
distributions in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits will not be taxable to a non us shareholder to the extent that such distributions do not exceed the adjusted basis of the non us shareholder s shares  but rather will reduce the adjusted basis of such shares 
to the extent that our distributions exceed our current and accumulated earnings and profits and the adjusted basis of a non us shareholder s shares  such distributions will give rise to tax liability if the non us shareholder would otherwise be subject to tax on any gain from the sale or disposition of his shares in jameson  as described below 
if it cannot be determined at the time a distribution is made whether or not such distribution will be in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits  the distribution will be subject to withholding at a rate 
further  we will be required to withhold of any distribution in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits 
however  amounts withheld may be refundable if it is subsequently determined that such distribution was in excess of our current and accumulated earnings and profits and the amount withheld exceeded the non us shareholder s non us tax liability  if any 
for any year in which we qualify as a reit  distributions that are attributable to gain from our sales or exchanges of united states real property interests will be taxed to a non us shareholder under the provisions of the foreign investment in real property tax act of firpta 
under firpta  distributions attributable to gain from sales of united states real property interests are taxed to a non us shareholder as if such gain were effectively connected with a united states business 
non us shareholders would thus be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to us shareholders subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax 
also  distributions subject to firpta may be subject to a branch profits tax in the case of a foreign corporate shareholder not entitled to treaty exemption 
we are required by treasury regulations to withhold of any distribution to a non us shareholder that could be designated by us as a capital gains dividend 
this amount is creditable against the non us shareholder s firpta tax liability 
gain recognized by a non us shareholder upon a sale of shares generally will not be taxed under firpta if we are a domestically controlled reit  defined generally as a reit in which at all times during a specified testing period less than in value of the reit s stock was held directly or indirectly by foreign persons 
we believe that we are a domestically controlled reit  and therefore the sale of our shares should not be subject to taxation under firpta 
we anticipate that we will continue to be a domestically controlled reit and that sales of our shares by non us shareholders will not be subject to non us taxation unless the investment in the shares is effectively connected with the non us shareholder s trade or business in the united states  in which case such non us shareholder would be taxed at the normal capital gain rates applicable to us shareholders subject to any applicable alternative minimum tax  or in the case of a non us shareholder who is a nonresident alien individual  such non us shareholder was present in the united states for a period or periods aggregating days or more during the taxable year and certain other conditions apply  in which case such person would be subject to a tax on his capital gains 
other tax consequences we and our shareholders may be subject to state or local taxation in various state or local jurisdictions  including those in which we or they transact business or reside 
the state and local tax treatment of jameson and our shareholders may not conform to the federal income tax consequences discussed above 
consequently  you should consult your own tax advisor regarding the effect of state and local tax laws on an investment in us

general the following table shows certain historical financial and other information for the years indicated 
combined jameson and signature brands year ended december  occupancy rate adr revpar room rentals s other inn revenues s room nights available operating inns at period end rooms available at period end we have grown from a hotel chain with four jameson inns at january   to jameson inns and signature inns in operation at december  in addition  we completed existing jameson inn expansion in january from our inception in until december   we were engaged in the business of developing  owning and managing jameson inns 
as part of our development activities  we engaged in development and construction of new jameson inns 
on december   we reorganized by divesting ourselves of the subsidiary corporations through which we conducted our construction activities  securities brokerage activities and aviation operations 
in addition  we transferred our outdoor advertising business to kitchin hospitality s predecessor 
we no longer manage or operate our inns upon their completion  but limit our primary activities to developing and owning the properties 
effective january   our primary source of revenue became lease payments by kitchin hospitality which leases and operates our jameson inns under the master leases 
all of the signature inns are also leased to kitchin hospitality 
on may   we merged with signature inns  inc which owned and operated a chain of limited service hotels in the midwest 
in this merger  we acquired signature inns and an interest in a limited partnership which owned an additional signature inn 
in december  we acquired the outstanding limited partnership interest in that partnership and took direct ownership of the hotel property 
effective april   we acquired certain assets of kitchin hospitality consisting of billboards  ground leases for the sites on which the billboards are erected and other related assets 
as consideration for these assets we issued  shares of our series a preferred stock  paid cash in the amount of  and assumed liabilities in the amount of approximately  we obtained an opinion from interstate johnson lane corporation that the terms of the transaction were fair from a financial standpoint to us and to our shareholders 
these assets are leased to and operated by kitchin hospitality which pays us annual rentals on each of the billboards 
rental payments from these assets totaled approximately  in   in and  in in addition to the billboards leased to kitchin hospitality  we collect rental payment on other billboards owned by us and leased to parties other than kitchin hospitality 
although room revenues are earned by our lessee  kitchin hospitality  not by us  they are the basis upon which the percentage rent earned by us under the master leases is determined and  accordingly  we discuss those revenues below 
the term same inn room revenues refers to revenues earned with respect to our inns which were operating during all of both comparison periods and includes revenues attributable to rooms added to our existing inns by virtue of expansion of such inns 
the master leases provide for the payment of base rent and percentage rent 
for the year ended december   we earned a combined base rent and percentage rent in the aggregate amount of million from the rental of jameson inns and million from the rental of signature inns 
the principal determinant of percentage rent under the master leases is room revenues of our inns 
therefore  we believe that a review of the historical performance of the operations of our operating inns occupancy  adr and revpar is appropriate for understanding our lease revenue see funds from operations  below  for the calculation of ffo  adr and revpar 
we also continue to consider other strategic alternatives as a possible means of growth and increasing shareholder value 
these include acquisitions of other properties  business combinations  corporate restructuring  terminating our status as a real estate investment trust and other alternatives 
we have made no decisions or commitments at this time  but we intend to continue to consider any such alternatives 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december for fiscal  we earned base rent and percentage rent in the aggregate amount of million 
our lease revenue for decreased  as compared to due to the following factors lease revenues earned from the signature inns decreased  in versus due to a decline in occupancy rate  as well as a slight decrease of room nights available in as a result of the sale of one signature inn during in  all that was earned from the signature inns was base rent 
during  approximately  of percentage rent was earned by the signature brand above the base rent 
lease revenues earned from the jameson inns increased  due to a slight increase in the average daily rate compared to  offset somewhat by a decline in the occupancy rate 
one new jameson inn was opened in  and five new jameson inns were opened during the increase in the number of rooms due to the opening of new inns was offset partially by the sale of three jameson inns during additionally  lease revenue earned from billboards decreased  in due to the sale of certain billboards in connection with inn sales during and a soft us economy during along with the continuing effect of the september  terrorist attacks negatively impacted travel and demand for hotel rooms generally 
our property and other taxes expenses totaled million in  compared with million for the decrease of  is attributable primarily to a decrease in franchise taxes due in to changes in the franchise tax laws in certain of the states in which our inns are located  as property taxes were relatively flat compared to our insurance expenses totaled million in  compared with  for the  increase is attributable to increased costs associated with the year end renewal of our property and liability insurance which was adversely affected by the impact to the insurance markets of the september  terrorist attacks 
our depreciation expense remained relatively constant at million compared to million in our net operating inns decreased by three but this was offset by the depreciation of several inn expansions and capital expenditures on the inns 
our general and administrative expense includes an allocation of salary  office overhead and other general and administrative costs of the corporate office 
we share employees and office space with kitchin hospitality 
our general and administrative expenses for increased to million as compared to million in due to additional time spent by shared employees in our business matters as compared to kitchin hospitality s  and an increase in professional fees

this was comprised of a net gain of  upon the sale of four inns  and a net gain of  in connection with the sale of a tract of land during during we experienced a negative net impact on our earnings of approximately  with respect to properties sold or held for sale 
this consisted of a  impairment loss related to seven inns  a net gain of  upon the sale of five other inns  and a net gain of  in connection with the sale of a tract of land during our interest expense decreased from million in period to million in this was the result of the weighted average interest rate on our debt of during compared to during our principal balance of our outstanding debt was reduced million during our income from discontinued operations increased slightly to  in compared to  in we now report as discontinued operations assets held for sale and assets sold in the current period 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december for fiscal  we earned base rent and percentage rent in the aggregate amount of million 
our lease revenue for increased  as compared to fiscal this was due to the following factors lease revenues earned from the jameson inns increased  due primarily to an increase in available rooms during five new jameson inns opened in  and seventeen new jameson inns were opened during this increase in the number of rooms was offset partially by the sale of eleven jameson inns during lease revenues earned from the signature inns decreased  in versus due to a decline in revpar

this was comprised of a  loss on impairment of real estate related to seven of our inns  a net gain of  upon the sale of five other inns  and a net gain of  in connection with the sale of a tract of land during in  we sold a jameson inn and recorded a loss of  and a gain of  in connection with the sale of a tract of land 
our interest expense increased from million in to million in this was the result of higher average principal indebtedness outstanding related primarily to the opening of new jameson inns subsequent to december   and a slightly higher average effective interest rate for as compared to our principal balance of our outstanding debt increased million during the weighted average interest rate on our debt was during compared to during funds from operations ffo supplemental non gaap information we believe ffo to be a meaningful measure of operating performance but it should not be considered an alternative to generally accepted accounting principles 
we calculate ffo for all periods consistent with the national association of real estate investment trusts  inc definition from their white paper issued in april ffo has been calculated as net income attributable to common stockholders before depreciation expense  gains or losses on disposal of depreciable real estate assets  impairment losses of real estate assets and extraordinary items 
however  ffo as presented in this table may not be comparable to similarly titled measures presented by other companies 
the following table illustrates our calculation of funds from operations and adjusted ffo for the years ended december   and year ended december  dollars in thousands net income loss available to common stockholders depreciation expense gain loss on disposal of real estate loss on impairment of real estate funds from operations ffo loan fee amortization expense additions to reserve for furniture  fixtures and equipment required loan principal repayments adjusted ffo including amounts of depreciation expense related to discontinued operations 
this amount equals of the room revenues of our inns for the respective period 
we believe this conforms to hotel industry standards as an amount necessary for ongoing renovation and refurbishment 
our actual expenditures for these purposes have exceeded these amounts due to product and room upgrades 
our net cash used in financing activities during included proceeds from mortgage notes net of repayments and related deferred finance costs of million  in addition to these scheduled principal debt payments of million 
liquidity and capital resources our net cash provided by operations was million in our principal sources of liquidity are existing cash on hand of million at december   the remaining availability under the line of credit and expansion construction loan  million at december   proceeds from the refinancing of inns with increased borrowing capacity  and net proceeds from the sale of inns and land held for sale 
these funds are used to meet the principal repayments of our amortizing debt  the refurbishing costs and capital maintenance of our existing inns  and certain other cash requirements including the payment of preferred and common dividends and other operating expenses 
as a reit  we must distribute to stockholders at least of our taxable income  excluding net capital gains  to preserve the favorable tax treatment accorded to a reit under the internal revenue code 
we expect to fund any required distributions through cash generated from operations  existing cash on hand and external borrowings as necessary 
however  we do not anticipate having net taxable income in our net cash used in investing activities for totaled million 
we received net cash proceeds totaling million from the sale of four inns and two parcels of land 
proceeds from these asset sales were primarily used to retire debt 
we had an agreement to sell a signature inn hotel at december  that we sold during the first quarter of  and we may sell additional inns in the future 
additions to property and equipment totaled million for as compared to million in included in additions to property and equipment are capital expenditures for refurbishing and renovating existing inns of approximately million for compared to million for we plan to spend million during on refurbishment and renovation projects of existing inns  including the planned conversion of a signature inn to a jameson inn 
these expenditures exceed our minimum policy of of inn room revenues  which we commit to spend for capital improvements and the refurbishment and replacement of furniture  fixtures and equipment at our inns 
these capital expenditures are funded from operating cash flow  from net proceeds from the disposition of under performing hotels and possibly from additional borrowings 
we anticipate this trend to continue during as we refurbish our existing inns to ensure their competitiveness in the market and begin to convert a signature inn to a jameson inn in the first quarter of these capital expenditures are in addition to amounts spent on normal repairs and maintenance  which are paid for by lessee kitchin hospitality 
the remaining million in additions to property and equipment in is due primarily to the opening of one new inn and expansions of four inns during the year 
our net cash used in financing activities during totaled million 
this amount included the payment of dividends to common and preferred shareholders of million  net proceeds from our dividend reinvestment plan of  proceeds from mortgage notes net of repayments and related deferred finance costs of million  and scheduled long term debt payments of million 
our long range plan is to selectively develop new jameson inns and to expand existing jameson inns as suitable opportunities arise and when adequate sources of financing are available  but we currently have no new development plans scheduled for since our election to be taxed as a reit  we have financed construction of new jameson inns and currently intend to continue financing the construction of any new inns entirely with bank borrowings 
we continue to consider possible additional long term debt or equity financing that would be available to fund any future development activities 
at december  the company had total indebtedness of million compared to million at december  of that  approximately million is variable rate debt adjustable during as follows adjustment date amount in millions weighted average interest rate january february march april may july september october adjusts daily total during the weighted average interest rate on our debt was compared to during we anticipate full year required principal repayments of approximately million 
we have million of scheduled principal payments and maturing loans for including letters of credit aggregating million that expire on december  these letters of credit are secured by four of our signature inns at december   including the inn sold in january which resulted in the retirement of million of associated indebtedness 
there are three other mortgage loans  along with our line of credit  which mature during based on our preliminary discussions with these lenders we believe we will be successful in obtaining replacement financing at renewal terms satisfactory to us 
we have four stock incentive plans in place 
as of december    shares of our common stock were authorized for issuance  including  available for future option grants and restricted stock grants under the and plans 
as of december   options to purchase  shares of our common stock were outstanding including  which were exercisable 
in  we made a tender offer for outstanding options to purchase shares of common stock issued under the stock incentive plan at a nominal price of 
per option share 
as a result of this tender offer  options to purchase  shares of common stock were tendered and cancelled during in addition   shares of our common stock issued to certain employees of jameson and kitchin hospitality are restricted as to sale until vested in through on february   we registered with the securities and exchange commission the issuance of  shares of our common stock under our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan that was approved by our board of directors on february  our dividend reinvestment and stock purchase plan provides holders of our common and preferred stock with a convenient method of investing cash dividends and voluntary cash payments in additional shares of our common stock 
we use the net proceeds received by us from the sale of the shares of common stock under the plan for working capital and other corporate purposes 
inflation operators of hotels in general possess the ability to adjust room rates quickly 
nevertheless  competitive pressures have limited  and may in the future limit  kitchin hospitality s ability to raise rates in the face of inflation 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
impairment of real estate assets we review long lived assets for indicators of impairment at least quarterly or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying values of our property may be impaired 
if indicators are present  we project the expected future results of operations of the asset based on our estimates on future budgeted earnings before interest expense  income taxes  depreciation and amortization  and use growth assumptions to project these amounts over the expected life of the underlying asset 
our growth assumptions are based on assumed future changes in the economy and changes in demand for lodging in our markets  if actual conditions differ from those in our assumptions  the actual results of each asset s actual future operations could be significantly different from the estimated results we used in our analysis 
if the analysis indicates that the carrying value is not recoverable from expected future results estimated to be generated by those assets  we write down the asset to its estimated fair value and recognize an impairment loss 
impairment losses are based on the difference between the book value of each individual property and the related estimated fair value of each property 
we did not recognize any impairment losses during or in  we recognized million of impairment losses 
overhead allocation from kitchin hospitality kitchin hospitality operates all of our inns and pays all of our salaries and administrative overhead expenses pursuant to the cost reimbursement agreement 
the overhead allocation pursuant to the cost reimbursement agreement involves a substantial number of estimates pertaining to the allocation between entities of employee s time and various other costs 
kitchin hospitality charged the company   and  in  and  respectively of allocated salaries  office overhead and other general and administrative costs pursuant to the cost reimbursement agreement 
we expensed approximately   and  of the allocated costs in  and  respectively 
the remainder represented capitalizable property and equipment costs 
historically  a significant portion of the overhead expense was charged to kitchin hospitality for the development of new inns 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a significant portion of our existing indebtedness is subject to adjustable interest rates primarily with twelve month interest rate readjustment dates  and is secured by our inns and billboards 
because of the current cost and relative unavailability of fixed interest rate long term financing  we anticipate that the majority of our future borrowings will continue to be at interest rates which adjust with certain indices 
therefore  our costs of financing our floating rate debt may increase subject to events beyond our direct control 
our variable rate debt consists primarily of individual property mortgages that adjust one time per year at varying dates for a twelve month period following the interest rate adjustment date 
a hypothetical basis point change on january  in the indices underlying our floating rate debt would have changed our annual interest expense by approximately million based on the weighted average borrowings subject to variable rates during however  the actual annual impact to interest expense would have been less than million due to the various annual interest rate readjustment dates of our variable rate debt 
we expect to continue to selectively obtain financial instruments  including interest rate cap agreements  to limit our exposure to increases in short term interest rates 
additional information regarding this  to the extent that it is relevant to our business  is included in item of this report under the caption risk factors interest rate increases could increase our cost of current and future debt and in item under the caption liquidity and capital resources
