stated in millions oilfield services change operating revenue pretax segment income schlumbergersema change operating revenue pretax segment income other change operating revenue pretax segment income restated  in part  for organizational changes and discontinued operations 
pretax segment income represents income before taxes and minority interest  excluding interest income  interest expense  gain on sale of securities and amortization of intangibles and charges  net see pages of this report 
sema plc was acquired april  compared to and on a pro forma basis assuming the acquisition occurred on january  schlumbergersema revenue for was up 
principally comprises the cards  terminals  meters north america and nptest activities and in  the divested resource management services businesses 
oilfield services results revenue for was billion versus billion in reflecting a decrease due to reduced activity in north america and latin america  which were and lower respectively 
this was partially mitigated by higher activity in europe cis west africa  up and the middle east asia  where revenue increased 
the m i rig count fell 
pretax operating income decreased primarily from reduced margins in wireline  well services and seismic technologies as activity declined in north america 
a sharp fall in revenue at the beginning of reflected declining activity levels in north america  which remained depressed for the remainder of the year  together with political and economic uncertainty in latin america 
in the second and third quarters  robust activity in europe cis west africa  and signs of a possible recovery in asia  mitigated the effects of low north american drilling levels resulting in increased revenues 
however  this trend was short lived as slower activity outside north america due mainly to seasonal influences coupled with budget cuts resulted in lower fourth quarter revenues 
in  the caspian  russia and mexico geomarkets posted the highest double digit revenue growth of  and respectively versus from a technology standpoint  the strongest performer was well completions productivity where acquisitions  testing  advanced completions systems and artificial lift technology market share gains resulted in revenue growth 
during the year schlumberger acquired a 
comeau associates a leading provider of electrical engineering products and services for artificially lifted wells 
this latest addition  combined with the successful integration of sensa and phoenix technologies into the schlumberger artificial lift services portfolio  contributed to higher sales in particularly in the eastern hemisphere 
the drilling measurements technology segment also recorded solid revenue growth of fuelled largely by the continued penetration of the powerdrive rotary steerable system into new geomarkets 

table of contents in addition to a 
comeau associates limited  schlumberger made two further acquisitions during the year to bolster its real time reservoir management suite of services 
in january  schlumberger acquired norwegian based inside reality as providing new d virtual reality systems that create a unique and powerful environment for interactive well planning and real time geosteering analysis 
schlumberger also acquired the software and services business of technoguide as a leader in the reservoir modeling domain 
the seismic downturn continued throughout resulting in significantly lower activity levels  a reduction in multiclient license sales and extreme pricing pressures for westerngeco 
as a result  schlumberger announced operating losses in the third quarter related to contracts in india and mexico  and in the fourth quarter  workforce reductions of  people coupled with the closure of its land based seismic operations in the us lower states and canada 
westerngeco revenue of billion decreased and pretax operating income of million fell 
north america north america revenue of billion decreased versus while the m i rig count dropped 
a steep revenue decline at the outset of the year reflected a continued lackluster drilling environment and unseasonably mild weather conditions 
throughout the remainder of the year activity levels remained depressed resulting in essentially flat revenue for other factors contributing to reduced revenues included lower non rig related activity resulting in lower wireline  well services and well completions productivity revenues  the effects of the tropical storms in the third quarter  a slow pick up in canadian activity post spring break up and the previously stated closure of us land based and canadian seismic operations 
pretax operating income of million decreased due to pricing pressures across all services  particularly in well services  well completions productivity and seismic services 
westerngeco revenue of million and pretax operating income of million fell and respectively 
latin america latin america revenue of billion decreased versus while the m i rig count decreased 
ongoing political and economic uncertainty in the region continued to affect business conditions  particularly in venezuela and argentina 
this particularly impacted results in the first half of the year 
in sharp contrast  the second half of saw solid growth partly as a result of higher demand for drilling measurements and well completions technologies connected to contracts in the burgos basin 
in addition  the completion of an ipm project that involved the sale of production facilities in ecuador for million in the fourth quarter contributed to end of year higher revenue 
pretax operating income of million declined as a result of decreased activity in venezuela and argentina 
westerngeco revenue of million increased  however  pretax operating income of million dropped due to the recognition of land seismic contract losses in mexico in the third quarter 
europe cis west africa europe cis west africa revenue of billion increased versus as the m i rig count decreased 
strong revenue growth was recorded in the first three quarters reflecting increased activity levels and market share gains particularly in the caspian and russia geomarkets in respect to artificial lift and drilling technologies 
the well completions productivity technology segment recorded the strongest growth of followed by drilling measurements  which grew 

table of contents this growth was partially mitigated by a steep revenue drop in the fourth quarter due to exceptionally severe winter weather conditions in the north sea and russia that affected all services  particularly seismic and fracturing activities 
in addition  operator budget cuts in the nigeria geomarket and refocused investment decisions in the uk contributed to lower fourth quarter revenues 
pretax operating income of million decreased due to softening in pricing towards the end of the year and restructuring in the region to reduce support infrastructure to match slowing activity levels 
westerngeco revenue of million decreased and the pretax operating loss of million was higher than middle east asia middle east asia revenue of billion increased outpacing the m i rig count  which grew for the same period 
after a decline at the beginning of the year resulting from exceptional artificial lift sales at the end of  the asian market showed signs of recovery highlighted by strong revenue growth in the second quarter 
over the year  the india and malaysia brunei philippines geomarkets recorded the strongest growth due to increased activity in these countries 
in addition  the wireline and well services technology segments posted the highest growth  up and respectively 
this was partly offset  however  by a slowdown in activity in the second half of due to a number of major projects nearing completion  lower equipment sales and a significant reduction in seismic activity throughout the area 
pretax operating income of million was flat despite the revenue growth due to marine seismic contract losses incurred in india in the third quarter coupled with softening pricing in well completions and productivity services 
westerngeco revenue of million increased  however  pretax operating income of million declined due to the recognition of marine seismic contract losses in india 
results record oilfield services operating revenue of billion increased over in sharp contrast with the worldwide m i rig count  which grew only 
increased non rig related activity  partly attributable to the westerngeco joint venture  and higher pricing levels contributed to the growth 
operating revenue started to grow in the first quarter  due to continued high activity in north america and increased demand internationally 
the latter continued throughout and was reflected in the europe cis west africa and middle east asia area results 
however  softening north american drilling activity in the third quarter  as a result of slower economic growth and declining natural gas drilling activity  offset international growth 
the westerngeco joint venture in its first full financial reporting year was the largest contributor to double digit growth in all areas with the malaysia brunei philippines  alaska  gulf coast and west south africa geomarkets recording the strongest results versus market share gains  improved pricing levels and the introduction of new technology contributed to strong growth in the drilling measurements technology business 
in addition  improved reda submersible pump sales and the continued expansion of the powerstim well production optimization solution contributed to significant growth in the well completions productivity technology segment 
was a significant year as oilfield services acquired several key technologies as part of its continuing focus to build a complete suite of real time reservoir optimization services 
in april  schlumberger acquired baker jardine  a leading provider of software tools  it consulting and integrated solutions that help operators increase oil and gas production 
secondly  a unique distributing temperature sensing technique was added to the schlumberger real time offering through the acquisition of sensa 
the 
table of contents recognized leader in fiber optic sensing technologies  sensa provides operators with a continuous measurement for the monitoring of producing wells 
thirdly  schlumberger acquired phoenix  a leading provider of technologies and techniques for optimizing production from artificially lifted wells  in october north america north american operating revenue increased versus outpacing the m i rig count  which grew 
the strong operating revenue growth that continued in the first quarter of plateaued in the middle of the year 
this was due to slower economic conditions and declining natural gas prices  which resulted in reduced activity towards the end of the year 
the alaska and gulf coast geomarkets recorded the strongest revenue growth due to increased demand for drilling and measurements and well services  wireline technologies and higher seismic activity 
pretax operating income increased particularly due to strong demand for well services technologies and the significant impact of the westerngeco joint venture 
latin america operating revenue increased exceeding the m i rig count growth of 
increased activity across all services contributed to double digit growth in the geomarkets 
growth was led by the peru colombia ecuador and latin america south geomarkets as a result of increased drilling and measurements and well services 
further  higher well completions services during the year  and an increase in land seismic activity in bolivia during the fourth quarter contributed to growth in these geomarkets 
pretax operating income increased principally as a result of increases in ipm  wireline and the impact of the westerngeco joint venture 
europe cis west africa operating revenue increased in the europe cis west africa area  more than double the m i rig count growth  which rose 
overall moderate growth was recorded for the year led by high demand for well completions services in nigeria and strong growth in drilling and measurements and wireline services in the russia geomarket 
in particular  strong growth was seen in the west and south africa geomarket partly due to an early production facility project for ipm during the year 
pretax operating income increased due mainly to the well completions productivity segment  which recorded strong growth across most geomarkets 
middle east asia a increase in operating revenue surpassed the m i rig count four fold in almost all geomarkets in the region recorded strong double digit growth led by seismic  drilling and measurements and well services activities in the malaysia  brunei and philippines geomarket  and as a result of new contract wins in the gulf geomarket 
moderate sequential growth was recorded throughout the year reflecting the pick up in international activity 
pretax operating income increased comprised mostly of an increase in drilling measurements and in the well completions productivity technology segments 
results moderate growth was recorded during the first half of the year with sharp sequential growth in the second half of the year led by increased activity in north america and higher demand for drilling measurements technologies  up  and well services up 
the seismic down cycle  which started at the beginning of  continued through the first half of the year 
the second half of saw significant improvement leading to higher schlumberger activity due to the introduction of new generation seismic q marine technology and increased multiclient data sales 

table of contents oilfield services operating revenue increased compared with as the worldwide m i rig count grew 
north america north america operating revenue increased versus  in line with the m i rig count  which grew 
increased activity  which started in the third quarter of  continued into the beginning of with a significant increase in drilling activity due to the continued shift to natural gas exploration and development 
well services posted the strongest revenue growth  up followed by drilling measurements  up and wireline  which increased 
pretax operating income increased 
latin america latin america operating revenue increased for the year  consistent with a increase in the m i rig count 
there was strong growth in the second half of across most technology segments 
pretax operating segment income increased due to improved profitability led by drilling measurements and well services 
europe cis west africa operating revenue increased in europe cis west africa during  consistent with a increase in the m i rig count 
results in the first quarter were lower year over year due to continued flat activity and a sharp decline in seismic activity in this region for the same period 
the increase in activity in the second half of the year was moderate compared with the other areas 
pretax operating income increased as a result of increased pricing for wireline and drilling measurements technologies 
middle east asia operating revenue in middle east asia increased  in line with a increase in the m i rig count 
lower first quarter results resulted from the continued industry down cycle  and the growth was moderate for the remainder of the year due to a slow increase in activity 
stronger sequential growth in the second half of the year resulted from increased activity in the middle east and improved demand particularly for drilling measurements and testing technologies 
pretax operating income increased 
schlumbergersema results schlumbergersema operating revenue increased compared with mainly due to the acquisition of sema plc whose results were consolidated with effect from april  on a proforma basis  assuming the acquisition occurred on january   operating revenue in was up compared to the pretax segment income of million compared to a loss of million in  reflecting the cost reductions initiatives implemented since the integration of sema plc into schlumberger 
the pretax segment income excludes the charges discussed on pages of this report 
in december an updated strategy for schlumbergersema was announced 
the schlumbergersema focus is now on it consulting and systems integration together with network and infrastructure solutions  primarily in global energy while continuing to develop specific regional market sectors in areas where it has a successful competitive position based on scale and domain knowledge 
this strategy is designed to create industry leadership in the energy market by combining the systems integration skills of sema with the global reach and energy sector knowledge of schlumberger 

table of contents schlumbergersema won the top prize at the prestigious management consultancies association mca best management practice awards in london for its work on the salt lake city olympic winter games 
at the winter olympic games  schlumbergersema led a consortium of technology partners in a three year long project to deliver the it infrastructure needed to run the games 
dr jacques rogge  president of the international olympic committee commented the information technology operations of any olympic games play a vital role in the overall success of the games 
schlumberger is also the official worldwide information technology partner for the olympic games in  and north south america operating revenue increased over primarily due to increased activity from the network infrastructure solutions nis business as a result of several large it outsourcing projects 
these include the conoco and dallas county it projects and the dexa 
net global connectivity solution to provide communications for houston based atwood oceanics offshore and land facilities around the world 
partially offsetting the increase in activity from nis  revenue declined in the telecom and utility industries due primarily to the weak it services spending environment as customers faced economic challenges and continued to revise budgets downwards and delay decisions on contract awards 
however  major contracts have been awarded in the energy segment such as the online energy management system for aes infoenergy in brazil and the systems integration and data management services contracts with nebraska public power district nppd of columbus  nebraska 
despite the marginal increase in revenue  pretax operating loss of million represented an improvement of over  mainly attributable to the cost reduction programs implemented throughout the area 
europe middle east africa operating revenue increased mainly due to the inclusion of a full year s revenue from the acquisition of sema plc compared to nine months in on a comparable basis the revenue increased by despite a declining it services market in europe for the first time since the main contributor to the growth was the public sector mainly in the uk where schlumbergersema won large outsourcing contracts with the association of train operating companies  the department of work and pension and the vehicle inspectorate 
also contributing to the improvements were an energy related project for brussels based electrabel sa  a leading energy producer  distributor and supplier in belgium  with power plants in eight european countries serving about million customers daily and a health and welfare services project to consignia s  employees in the uk 
pretax operating income increased due mainly to the cost cutting program implemented throughout the year 
asia operating revenue increased 
on a comparable basis  operating revenue would have been flat 
the decreased activity in telecommunications  mainly in china and taiwan  was offset by the increase in the finance segment on new outsourcing contracts in the insurance sector in japan for mass mutual and delivery of payment systems in china 
pretax operating income decreased mainly attributable to pricing pressure and economic declines in the telecommunications it services industry 
telecom products operating revenue increased over principally due to the inclusion of sema plc 
on a comparable basis the activity was flat despite the sharp decline in the telecommunications industry 
during the year the focus was on streamlining the product portfolio and reducing the number of r d centers and reducing the workforce to the level of activity 
the pretax operating loss of million was an improvement over the loss of million in mainly due to the significant workforce reduction aimed at aligning r d with the product development cycles 

table of contents results on april   schlumberger completed the acquisition of sema plc for billion 
sema plc is a leading it and technical services company with a strong european presence 
the acquisition was financed through existing cash resources of schlumberger and from borrowings under a billion floating rate credit facility 
as a result of the acquisition  the schlumbergersema business segment was created combining sema plc and certain businesses of schlumberger test transactions and resource management services  including cellnet and convergent 
operating revenue increased billion over due to the acquisition of sema plc 
excluding the acquisition of sema plc the operating revenue increase would have been million on a pro forma basis 
nis experienced a operating revenue growth for versus mostly due to e p contracts demonstrating that this industry is recognizing the importance of it connectivity and security 
north south america operating revenue increased versus essentially due to the inclusion of the full year s activity for the convergent group  acquired in november and cellnet data systems  acquired in june additionally the increased utilities activity was a result of strong demand for real time energy management systems rtems services and further deployment of related networks  the extension of key existing utility business contracts in north america for utility data management services and the award of a significant contract for consulting and personal energy management advanced data services 
contributing to the growth was the award of nis projects by university of texas medical board  shell and ecopetrol 
pretax operating loss was lower than the previous year 
europe middle east africa operating revenue increased significantly due to the inclusion of sema plc 
excluding sema plc the year on year pro forma operating revenue increase would have been million due principally to the full inclusion of data marine systems limited acquired in october and to the award of multi million dollar contracts in france for banque de france and in the uk for metropolitan police 
pretax operating income increased significantly due to the inclusion of sema plc 
asia operating revenue increased almost eight fold largely due to the integration of sema plc 
excluding sema plc the year on year growth would have been million entirely due to stronger nis activity and to sustained demand for business continuity and outsourcing services throughout the area exemplified by the desktop outsourcing project for caltex in sumatra  indonesia 
pretax operating income increased significantly due to the inclusion of sema plc 
telecom products there was no activity prior to the activity was mainly led by strong bookings in mobile messaging systems  with the first semaportal short message server implementation and customer care and billing products system integration for mobile operators  such as the project awarded by telecom italia mobile tim which covers their operations in europe and brazil 
results during the year  schlumbergersema took strategic steps in the global energy segment to build its solutions offerings through the acquisition in june of cellnet data systems  the leading provider of telemetry technology for the development and deployment of large scale automatic meter reading amr systems and the convergent group  a leading builder of digital enterprises focusing on the utility sector  in november 
table of contents operating revenue increased year on year reflecting the above two acquisitions and the acquisition of the remaining stake in omnes  a joint venture previously equally owned by schlumberger and cable wireless 
north south america operating revenue increased more than four fold over due to market expansion  including the acquisition of cellnet data systems and the convergent group  the receipt of several major orders in real time energy management systems rtems and the university of texas medical board nis contract 
the pretax operating loss reflected the newly acquired cellnet and convergent activities 
europe middle east africa operating revenue increased and pretax operating income increased due to the consolidation of omnes and the full consolidation of data marine systems 
asia operating revenue increased and pretax operating income increased fold entirely due to the consolidation of of omnes into schlumberger 
telecom products there was no activity in telecom products during the year other included in this segment are nptest  consisting of the core product lines of schlumberger semiconductor solutions  smart cards  point of sale terminals  ecity terminals  payphones  payments systems  electricity meters and the divested businesses of the former resource management services segment 
on may  nptest filed a registration statement with the securities and exchange commission for a proposed initial public offering of its shares of common stock which is not yet effective 
results operating revenue decreased reflecting the divestiture of the resource management services north american water metering activities and the non north american electricity and water meter and worldwide gas meter businesses in november nptest activity increased due to a partial recovery in test equipment sales in north america and asia partially offset by decreases in diagnostic equipment sales and equipment support services 
volume product activity remained flat despite the continuing slump in the telecommunications industry and the continued pricing pressure 
this was partially offset by higher activity in banking and it cards coupled with a favorable euro dollar exchange rate 
pretax operating income decreased mainly due to the divestiture of resource management services and eroded profitability in the smart cards business 
results operating revenue decreased reflecting mainly the divestiture of the resource management services businesses  which were sold in november and the decline in semiconductor activity  which followed the down cycle in the worldwide semiconductor industry 

table of contents volume products operating revenue grew by despite a slowdown in the telecommunications industry 
smart cards operating revenue increased compared with nptest revenue decreased approximately from the prior year due to the sharp decline in the industry  with all product lines affected 
pretax operating income decreased due mainly to pricing pressure in both the semiconductor and the smart cards industries 
results operating revenue was flat 
increased activity in the smart cards business  driven by outstanding growth of the mobile communications market and in nptest up was offset by the decline in resource management services down where pressure on utility prices resulted in a continued downturn for the utility industry 
pretax operating income grew year on year mainly attributable to the improved profitability in smart cards

schlumbergersema segment net income of million improved from a loss of million in  reflecting the revenue increase of on a proforma basis assuming the sema plc acquisition took place on january  and the effect of the previously announced cost reduction program 
in the other segment  net income declined to million  from million in which included the divested resource management services businesses 
in  oilfield services segment net income increased million  or  to  million reflecting the growth in revenue  which outpaced the increase in the worldwide m i rig count 
higher pricing levels and increased non rig related activity were the major factors attributable to the record oilfield services revenues

in the other segment  net income of million declined million from the prior year with declines in the semiconductor related and cards activities 
in  oilfield services segment net income increased million  or  to million 
increases in e p expenditures and in oil and gas prices  resulting from increased oil demand and the lowest level of excess oil production capacity in decades  were the underlying factors of the strong increases in most areas  and notably in north america 
average worldwide rig count increased compared to schlumbergersema segment net loss of million was down million due to losses in the newly acquired cellnet and convergent businesses in north america 
in the other segment  net income of million increased million from the prior year mainly due to stronger results from the cards activity where revenue was up 
currency risks refer to page  translation of non us currencies in the notes to consolidated financial statements  for a description of the schlumberger policy on currency hedging 
there are no material unhedged assets  liabilities or commitments which are denominated in other than a business functional currency 
schlumberger businesses operate principally in us dollars  the euro and most other european currencies and most south american currencies 
while changes in exchange rates affect revenue  especially in the schlumbergersema segment  they also affect costs 
generally speaking  schlumberger is currency neutral 
for example  a change in average 
table of contents exchange rates of oecd currencies would have had no material effect on consolidated revenue and net income 
in general  when the us dollar weakens against other currencies  consolidated revenue increases  usually with no material effect on net income 
this is principally because the fall through incremental margin in the schlumbergersema segment offsets the higher oilfield services segment non us dollar denominated expenses 
research engineering expenditures by business segment were as follows stated in millions oilfield services schlumbergersema other in process r d charge relating to the bull cp acquisition 
interest expense interest expense decreased million  to million mainly due to a decrease in average borrowing rates from to 
the increase in of million  to million  was principally due to the significantly higher debt balances incurred  relating to the acquisition of sema plc  which were only partially offset by a reduction in average borrowing rate from to 
the increase in of million  to million  was mainly due to an increase in average borrowing rates from to 
hanover compressor transaction in august  schlumberger sold its oilfield services worldwide gas compression activity to hanover compressor company 
the proceeds included common stock of hanover compressor  with a value at closing of million  which is restricted from marketability until august  and a million long term subordinated note maturing december  the market value of schlumberger s investment in hanover compressor common stock was million as of december  following the decline in the market value of the stock below carrying value during the second quarter of  schlumberger has performed  and continues to perform  a periodic assessment in accordance with its policy to determine whether an other than temporary decline in fair value has occurred 
schlumberger evaluated the recoverability of its investment by reviewing recent information related to the industry and the operating results and financial position of hanover compressor and by considering schlumberger s requirement  ability and intent to hold the investment on a long term basis 
schlumberger concluded that evidence existed at december  to support the recoverability of its carrying value  that there were no events or changes in circumstances specifically relating to the business prospects of hanover compressor  that the underlying business fundamentals are good with natural gas supplies reduced and higher natural gas prices in north america 
in addition  the recently announced hanover cutbacks in workforce and capital expenditures coupled with no immediate debt maturities should provide adequate capital resources in the near term 
accordingly  schlumberger concluded that the decline in market value of its investment million in hanover compressor as of december  was temporary in nature and has not reduced the cost basis of that investment 
if the decline in value persists or should schlumberger s assessment change  schlumberger would take a charge to its earnings for the amount that is deemed unrecoverable 
the million long term subordinated note has a mandatory prepayment upon the issuance  sale or other disposition by hanover compressor of any shares of capital stock or other equity interests pursuant to a 
table of contents public offering or a private placement otherwise prepayment is discretionary 
as of december   schlumberger considers the carrying value of the note to be fully collectible 
as part of the sale agreement  schlumberger agreed that the financing of the pigap ii joint venture in venezuela would be non recourse to the buyer and would be executed prior to december  accordingly  schlumberger was obligated  with respect to the financing  to guarantee approximately million until the project was completed in and  if as of december   refinancing had not become non recourse to the buyer or the project had not achieved substantial completion  hanover compressor had an option to put its interest in the joint venture back to schlumberger 
as an outcome of the turmoil in venezuela  although the project reached substantial completion  the non recourse financing for the project was not achieved by december  on january   hanover compressor gave notice of its intention to exercise its right to put its ownership interest in the joint venture back to schlumberger 
the put is subject to certain consents and other conditions 
schlumberger s obligation to provide a guarantee with respect to the financing was eliminated 
as schlumberger originally deferred the gain on the sale of the joint venture in  there is no impact on schlumberger results of operations due to the hanover compressor exercise of its option 
charges continuing operations schlumberger recorded the following after tax and minority interest charges credits for continuing operations in  and n on december   schlumberger announced that the board of directors had approved an updated strategy for its schlumbergersema business segment 
the new strategic plan outlook  current business values and the reorganization of schlumbergersema constitute significant events that required an impairment analysis to be performed in accordance with fas schlumbergersema was valued on a stand alone basis  each reporting unit within schlumbergersema was valued using a discounted cash flow analysis based on a long term forecast prepared by schlumbergersema management with the assistance of a third party valuation expert 
the implied multiples yielded by the discounted cash flow analysis were compared to observed trading multiples of comparable companies and recent transactions in the it services industry to assess the fair value of the reporting units 
the fair value was below the book value 
as a result  goodwill was written down to its estimated fair value based on schlumberger s valuation 
the impairment of goodwill mainly reflects the current difficulties of the telecommunications industry and the severely depressed market values of the it companies serving schlumbergersema s sector 
certain intangible assets were also identified and written down as part of this process 
schlumberger recorded severance  facility and other costs in an effort to reduce costs at schlumbergersema and westerngeco 
these costs related to expenses that offer no future benefit to the ongoing operations of these businesses 
during the fourth quarter  schlumberger also recorded an impairment charge  to reflect a change in the business projections of the westerngeco business  related to capitalized multiclient seismic library costs  a deferred tax valuation allowance and other costs 
the total of the above charges was  million and consisted of a goodwill impairment charge of  million  an intangible assets impairment charge of million  schlumbergersema severance and other charges of million in response to current business conditions  westerngeco severance and other charges of million in response to current business conditions  a westerngeco multiclient library impairment charge of million following a valuation of the library  environmental related charges of million  a deferred tax valuation allowance charge of million 
n in december  a credit of million reflecting the gain on the sale of two drilling rigs 
n in march  a charge of million related to the financial economic crisis in argentina

critical accounting policies and estimates schlumberger s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon schlumberger s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires schlumberger to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  schlumberger evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  valuation of inventories and investments  recoverability of long lived assets  income tax provision and deferred taxes  profit assumptions on long term percentage of completion contracts  contingencies and litigation and actuarial assumptions for employee benefit plans 
schlumberger bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 

table of contents schlumberger believes the critical accounting policies described below affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
schlumberger recognizes revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
schlumberger follows this method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged or credited to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known as a change in estimate 
losses on long term contracts are provided for when such losses are known and reasonably estimated 
schlumberger recognizes revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fee is fixed and determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
whether the fee is fixed and determinable is assessed based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
collection is assessed based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
revenues from contracts with multiple element arrangements  such as those including installation and integration services  are recognized as each element is earned based on the relative fair value of each element and when there are no undelivered elements that are essential to the functionality of the delivered elements 
for sales  either a binding purchase order  signed license agreement or a written contract is used as evidence of an arrangement 
revenue from maintenance services is recognized ratably over the contract term 
the training and consulting services time and materials are billed based on hourly rates  and revenue is generally recognized as these services are performed 
revenue from outsourcing services is generally recognized as services are performed 
the oilfield services segment capitalizes the cost associated with obtaining multiclient seismic data
