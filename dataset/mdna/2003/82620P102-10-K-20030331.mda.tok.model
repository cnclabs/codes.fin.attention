item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation capital resources 
risk based capital ratio requirements are discussed in greater detail in the following section 
prompt corrective action provisions federal law requires each federal banking agency to take prompt corrective action to resolve the problems of insured financial institutions  including but not limited to those that fall below one or more prescribed minimum capital ratios 
the federal banking agencies have by regulation defined the following five capital categories well capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of  adequately capitalized total risk based capital ratio of  tier risk based capital ratio of  and leverage ratio of or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage ratio of less than or if the institution receives the highest rating from its primary regulator  significantly undercapitalized total risk based capital ratio of less than  tier risk based capital ratio of less than  or leverage ratio less than  and critically undercapitalized tangible equity to total assets less than 
a bank may be treated as though it were in the next lower capital category if after notice and the opportunity for a hearing  the appropriate federal agency finds an unsafe or unsound condition or practice so warrants  but no bank may be treated as critically undercapitalized unless its actual capital ratio warrants such treatment 
at each successively lower capital category  an insured bank is subject to increased restrictions on its operations 
for example  a bank is generally prohibited from paying management fees to any controlling persons or from making capital distributions if to do so would make the bank undercapitalized 
asset 
table of contents growth and branching restrictions apply to undercapitalized banks  which are required to submit written capital restoration plans meeting specified requirements including a guarantee by the parent holding company  if any 
significantly undercapitalized banks are subject to broad regulatory authority  including among other things  capital directives  forced mergers  restrictions on the rates of interest they may pay on deposits  restrictions on asset growth and activities  and prohibitions on paying certain bonuses without fdic approval 
even more severe restrictions apply to critically undercapitalized banks 
most importantly  except under limited circumstances  not later than days after an insured bank becomes critically undercapitalized  the appropriate federal banking agency is required to appoint a conservator or receiver for the bank 
in addition to measures taken under the prompt corrective action provisions  insured banks may be subject to potential actions by the federal regulators for unsafe or unsound practices in conducting their businesses or for violations of any law  rule  regulation or any condition imposed in writing by the agency or any written agreement with the agency 
enforcement actions may include the issuance of cease and desist orders  termination of insurance of deposits in the case of a bank  the imposition of civil money penalties  the issuance of directives to increase capital  formal and informal agreements  or removal and prohibition orders against institution affiliated parties 
safety and soundness standards the federal banking agencies have also adopted guidelines establishing safety and soundness standards for all insured depository institutions 
those guidelines relate to internal controls  information systems  internal audit systems  loan underwriting and documentation  compensation and interest rate exposure 
in general  the standards are designed to assist the federal banking agencies in identifying and addressing problems at insured depository institutions before capital becomes impaired 
if an institution fails to meet these standards  the appropriate federal banking agency may require the institution to submit a compliance plan and institute enforcement proceedings if an acceptable compliance plan is not submitted 
premiums for deposit insurance the fdic regulations also implement a risk based premium system  whereby insured depository institutions are required to pay insurance premiums depending on their risk classification 
under this system  insured banks are categorized into one of three capital categories well capitalized  adequately capitalized  and undercapitalized and one of three supervisory categories based on federal regulatory evaluations 
the three supervisory categories are financially sound with only a few minor weaknesses group a  demonstrates weaknesses that could result in significant deterioration group b  and poses a substantial probability of loss group c 
the capital ratios used by the fdic to define well capitalized  adequately capitalized and undercapitalized are the same in the fdic s prompt corrective action regulations 
the current base assessment rates expressed as cents per of deposits are summarized as follows group a group b group c well capitalized adequately capitalized undercapitalized in addition  banks must pay an amount toward the retirement of the financing corporation bonds issued in the s to assist in the recovery of the savings and loan industry 
this amount fluctuates but for the first quarter of is cents per of insured deposits 
community reinvestment act the bank is subject to certain requirements and reporting obligations involving community reinvestment act cra activities 
the cra generally requires the federal banking agencies to evaluate the record of a financial institution in meeting the credit needs of its local communities  including low and moderate income neighborhoods 
the cra further requires the agencies to take a financial institution s record of meeting its 
table of contents community credit needs into account when evaluating applications for  among other things  domestic branches  consummating mergers or acquisitions  or holding company formations 
in measuring a bank s compliance with its cra obligations  the regulators utilize a performance based evaluation system which bases cra ratings on the bank s actual lending service and investment performance  rather than on the extent to which the institution conducts needs assessments  documents community outreach activities or complies with other procedural requirements 
in connection with its assessment of cra performance  the fdic assigns a rating of outstanding  satisfactory  needs to improve or substantial noncompliance 
the bank was last examined for cra compliance in june when it received a satisfactory cra assessment rating 
other consumer protection laws and regulations the bank regulatory agencies are increasingly focusing attention on compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations 
examination and enforcement has become intense  and banks have been advised to carefully monitor compliance with various consumer protection laws and regulations 
the federal interagency task force on fair lending issued a policy statement on discrimination in home mortgage lending describing three methods that federal agencies will use to prove discrimination overt evidence of discrimination  evidence of disparate treatment  and evidence of disparate impact 
in addition to cra and fair lending requirements  the bank is subject to numerous other federal consumer protection statutes and regulations 
due to heightened regulatory concern related to compliance with consumer protection laws and regulations generally  the bank may incur additional compliance costs or be required to expend additional funds for investments in the local communities it serves 
interstate banking and branching the riegle neal interstate banking and branching efficiency act of the interstate banking act regulates the interstate activities of banks and bank holding companies and establishes a framework for nationwide interstate banking and branching 
since june   a bank in one state has generally been permitted to merge with a bank in another state without the need for explicit state law authorization 
however  states were given the ability to prohibit interstate mergers with banks in their own state by opting out enacting state legislation applying equality to all out of state banks prohibiting such mergers prior to june  since  adequately capitalized and managed bank holding companies have been permitted to acquire banks located in any state  subject to two exceptions first  any state may still prohibit bank holding companies from acquiring a bank which is less than five years old  and second  no interstate acquisition can be consummated by a bank holding company if the acquirer would control more than of the deposits held by insured depository institutions nationwide or percent or more of the deposits held by insured depository institutions in any state in which the target bank has branches 
a bank may establish and operate de novo branches in any state in which the bank does not maintain a branch if that state has enacted legislation to expressly permit all out of state banks to establish branches in that state 
in california enacted legislation to implement important provisions of the interstate banking act discussed above and to repeal california s previous interstate banking laws  which were largely preempted by the interstate banking act 
the changes effected by interstate banking act and california laws have increased competition in the environment in which the bank operates to the extent that out of state financial institutions directly or indirectly enter the bank s market areas 
it appears that the interstate banking act has contributed to the accelerated consolidation of the banking industry 
while many large out of state banks have already entered the california market as a result of this legislation  it is not possible to predict the precise impact of this legislation on the bank and the company and the competitive environment in which they operate 

table of contents financial modernization act effective march  the gramm leach bliley act eliminated most barriers to affiliations among banks and securities firms  insurance companies  and other financial service providers  and enabled full affiliations to occur between such entities 
this legislation permits bank holding companies to become financial holding companies and thereby acquire securities firms and insurance companies and engage in other activities that are financial in nature 
a bank holding company may become a financial holding company if each of its subsidiary banks is well capitalized under the fdicia prompt corrective action provisions  is well managed  and has at least a satisfactory rating under the cra by filing a declaration that the bank holding company wishes to become a financial holding company 
no regulatory approval will be required for a financial holding company to acquire a company  other than a bank or savings association  engaged in activities that are financial in nature or incidental to activities that are financial in nature  as determined by the federal reserve board 
the company has no current intention of becoming a financial holding company  but may do at some point in the future if deemed appropriate in view of opportunities or circumstances at the time 
the gramm leach bliley act defines financial in nature to include securities underwriting  dealing and market making  sponsoring mutual funds and investment companies  insurance underwriting and agency  merchant banking activities  and activities that the board has determined to be closely related to banking 
a national bank and therefore  a state bank as well may also engage  subject to limitations on investment  in activities that are financial in nature  other than insurance underwriting  insurance company portfolio investment  real estate development and real estate investment  through a financial subsidiary of the bank  if the bank is well capitalized  well managed and has at least a satisfactory cra rating 
subsidiary banks of a financial holding company or national banks with financial subsidiaries must continue to be well capitalized and well managed in order to continue to engage in activities that are financial in nature without regulatory actions or restrictions  which could include divestiture of the financial in nature subsidiary or subsidiaries 
in addition  a financial holding company or a bank may not acquire a company that is engaged in activities that are financial in nature unless each of the subsidiary banks of the financial holding company or the bank has a cra rating of satisfactory or better 
the gramm leach bliley act also imposes significant new requirements on financial institutions with respect to the privacy of customer information  and modifies other existing laws  including those related to community reinvestment 
usa patriot act of on october   president bush signed the usa patriot act of the patriot act 
enacted in response to the terrorist attacks in new york  pennsylvania and washington  dc on september   the patriot act is intended to strengthen the ability of us law enforcement agencies and intelligence communities to work cohesively to combat terrorism on a variety of fronts 
the impact of the act on financial institutions of all kinds is significant and wide ranging 
the act contains sweeping anti money laundering and financial transparency laws and requires various regulations applicable to financial institutions  including due diligence requirements for financial institutions that administer  maintain  or manage private bank accounts or correspondent accounts for non us persons  standards for verifying customer identification at account opening  and rules to promote cooperation among financial institutions  regulators  and law enforcement entities in identifying parties that may be involved in terrorism or money laundering 

table of contents other pending and proposed legislation other legislative and regulatory initiatives which could affect the company  the bank and the banking industry in general are pending  and additional initiatives may be proposed or introduced before the united states congress  the california legislature and other governmental bodies in the future 
such proposals  if enacted  may further alter the structure  regulation and competitive relationship among financial institutions  and may subject the bank to increased regulation  disclosure and reporting requirements 
in addition  the various banking regulatory agencies often adopt new rules and regulations to implement and enforce existing legislation 
it cannot be predicted whether  or in what form  any such legislation or regulations may be enacted or the extent to which the business of the company or the bank would be affected thereby 
risk factors statements and financial discussion and analysis by management contained throughout this report that are not historical facts are forward looking statements made pursuant to the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of forward looking statements involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements herein include  without limitation  the factors set forth below 
poor economic conditions in our market areas may cause us to suffer higher default rates on our loans 
a substantial majority of our assets and deposits are generated in the san joaquin valley in central california 
as a result  poor economic conditions in the san joaquin valley could cause us to incur losses associated with higher default rates and decreased collateral values in our loan portfolio 
the san joaquin valley has not experienced the same type of growth that has occurred in other areas of california  especially those where high tech industries have taken hold 
unemployment levels have historically been and remain relatively high  especially in tulare county  which is our geographic center and the base of our agriculturally oriented communities 
the united states entered into an economic recession in  and california s silicon valley and other high tech areas were particularly impacted 
in addition  the war with iraq could have a significant negative effect on the national economy 
while the national recession has not necessarily worsened economic conditions in the san joaquin valley  the company s balance of non performing assets  while showing a decrease relative to year end  remains relatively high due in large part to lingering agricultural difficulties 
because of increased global competition and other factors  excess supply and low prices characterize the markets for many agricultural products 
if current recessionary conditions continue or deteriorate  we expect that our level of non performing assets could increase further 
concentrations of real estate loans could subject us to increased risks in the event of a real esate recession or natural disaster 
our loan portfolio is heavily concentrated in real estate loans  particularly commercial real estate 
at december   of our loan portfolio consisted of loans secured by real estate 
between the end of and the end of  our loans secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development loans increased from to of total loans  while loans secured by residential properties have decreased form to 
in the early s  the entire state of california experienced an economic recession that particularly impacted real estate values and resulted in increases in the level of delinquencies and losses for many financial institutions 
much of our market area seems to have been insulated from the significant fluctuations in real estate prices experienced by other parts of california over the past few decades 
however  if a similar real estate recession affects our market areas in the future  the security for many of our loans could be reduced in value and the ability of some of our borrowers to pay could decline 
similarly  the occurrence of a natural disaster like those california has experienced in the past  including earthquakes  brush fires  and flooding could impair the value of the collateral we hold for real estate secured loans and negatively impact our results of operations 
poor economic conditions affecting the agricultural industry could have an adverse effect on our customers and their ability to make payments to us 
a sizable portion of our total loan portfolio is to borrowers either directly or indirectly involved in the agricultural industry 
while a great number of our 
table of contents borrowers may not be individually involved in agriculture  many of the jobs in the san joaquin valley are ancillary to the regular production  processing  marketing and sales of agricultural commodities 
the ripple effect of lower commodity prices for milk  olives  grapes  tree fruit and oranges has a tendency to spread to lower land prices  lower borrower income  and lower collateral values 
in addition  weather patterns are of critical importance to row crop  tree fruit  and orange production 
a degenerative cycle of weather and commodity prices can impact consumer purchasing power  which has the potential to create further unemployment throughout the san joaquin valley 
such conditions have affected and may continue to adversely affect our borrower base and negatively impact our business 
we may have difficulty managing our growth 
management intends to leverage the company s current infrastructure to grow assets  and one to two new branches per year are also tentatively planned  although no assurance can be provided that this strategy will result in significant growth 
our ability to manage growth will depend primarily on our ability to monitor operations  control funding costs and operating expenses  maintain positive customer relations  and attract  assimilate and retain qualified personnel 
if we fail to achieve those objectives in an efficient and timely manner we may experience disruptions in our business plans  and our financial condition and results of operations could be adversely affected 
our earnings are subject to interest rate risk  especially if rates fall 
the earnings of most financial institutions depend largely on the relationship between the cost of funds  primarily deposits and borrowings  and the yield on earning assets such as loans and investment securities 
this relationship  known as the interest rate spread  is subject to fluctuation and is affected by economic  regulatory and competitive factors that influence interest rates  the volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  and the level of non performing assets 
many of these factors are beyond our control 
fluctuations in interest rates affect the demand of customers for our products and services  and the company is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that our interest bearing liabilities re price or mature more slowly or more rapidly or on a different basis than our interest earning assets 
given the current volume  mix  and re pricing characteristics of interest bearing liabilities and interest earning assets  our interest rate spread could be expected to decline slightly during times of falling interest rates  but could also be adversely impacted if interest rates increase 
therefore  significant fluctuations in interest rates may have a negative effect on our results of operations 
we operate in a competitive market dominated by banks and other financial services providers that offer a broder range of services than we provide  many of which have lower cost structures 
in california generally  and in our primary service area specifically  branches of major banks dominate the commercial banking industry 
by virtue of their larger capital  such institutions have substantially greater lending limits than we have  and perform certain functions for their customers  including trust services and international banking  which we are not equipped to offer directly but some of which we offer indirectly through correspondent relationships 
many of these banks also operate with economies of scale that result in lower operating costs than ours on a per loan or per asset basis 
we also compete with other financial institutions such as savings and loan associations  credit unions  thrift and loan companies  mortgage companies  securities brokerage companies and insurance companies located within and without our service area  and with quasi financial institutions such as money market funds for deposits and loans 
financial services like ours are increasingly offered over the internet on a national and international basis  and we compete with providers of these services as well 
ultimately  competition can drive down our interest margins and reduce our profitability 
it can also make it more difficult for us to continue to increase the size of our loan portfolio and deposit base 
you may have difficulty selling your shares in the future if a more active trading market for our stock does not develop 
although sierra bancorp s common stock has been listed on the nasdaq national market since august  the effective date of the holding company reorganization and bank of the 
table of contents sierra s common stock was previously listed on the nasdaq national market since june   trading in our stock has not been extensive and cannot be characterized as amounting to an active trading market 
we may experience loan losses in excess of our allowance for loan losses 
we try to limit the risk that borrowers will fail to repay loans by carefully underwriting the loans  nevertheless losses can and do occur 
we create an allowance for estimated loan losses in our accounting records  based on estimates of the following industry standards  historical experience with our loans  evaluation of economic conditions  regular reviews of the quality mix and size of the overall loan portfolio  regular reviews of delinquencies  and the quality of the collateral underlying our loans 
we maintain an allowance for loan losses at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb any specifically identified losses as well as any other losses inherent in our loan portfolio 
however  changes in economic  operating and other conditions  including changes in interest rates  that are beyond our control  may cause our actual loan losses to exceed our current allowance estimates 
if the actual loan losses exceed the amount reserved  it will hurt our business 
in addition  the fdic and the department of financial institutions  as part of their supervisory functions  periodically review our allowance for loan losses 
such agencies may require us to increase our provision for loan losses or to recognize further loan losses  based on their judgments  which may be different from those of our management 
any increase in the allowance required by the fdic or the department of financial institutions could also hurt our business 
our directors and executive officers control almost a majority of our stock  and your interests may not always be the same as those of the board and management 
as of february   our directors and executive officers together with their affiliates  beneficially owned approximately of the bank s outstanding voting stock not including vested option shares 
as a result  if all of these shareholders were to take a common position  they could most likely control the outcome of most corporate actions  such as approval of mergers or other business combinations  sales of all or substantially all of our assets  any matters submitted to a vote of our shareholders  issuance of any additional common stock or other equity securities  incurrence of debt other than in the ordinary course of business  the selection and tenure of our chief executive officer  and payment of dividends on common stock or other equity securities 
in some situations  the interests of our directors and executive officers may be different from yours 
however  our board of directors and executive officers have a fiduciary duty to act in the best interests of the shareholders  rather than in their own best interests  when considering a proposed business combination or any of these types of matters 
provisions in our articles of incorporation will delay or prevent changes in control of our corporation or our management 
these provisions make it more difficult for another company to acquire us  which could reduce the market price of our common stock and the price that you receive if you sell your shares in the future 
these provisions include the following a requirement that certain business combinations not approved by our board of directors receive the approval of two thirds of the outstanding shares  staggered terms of office for members of the board of directors  
table of contents the elimination of cumulative voting in the election of directors  and a requirement that our board of directors consider the potential social and economic effects on the our employees  depositors  customers and the communities we serve as well as certain other factors  when evaluating a possible tender offer  merger or other acquisition of the company

after taking into consideration information furnished by counsel to the company as to the current status of these claims or proceedings to which the company is a party  management is of the opinion that the ultimate aggregate liability represented thereby  if any  will not have a material adverse affect on the financial condition of the company

c dividends as a bank holding company that currently has no significant assets other than its equity interest in the bank  the company s ability to declare dividends depends primarily upon dividends it receives from the bank 
the bank s dividend practices in turn depend upon the bank s earnings  financial position  current and anticipated capital requirements and other factors deemed relevant by the bank s board of directors at that time 
the company paid cash dividends totaling million or per share in and million or per share in  representing and  respectively of the prior year s earnings 
as the holding company reorganization became effective on august   all of the dividends paid prior to that date were paid by the bank  rather than the company 
since  the bank or the company  as applicable has generally adhered to a policy of paying quarterly cash dividends totaling about of the prior year s net earnings to the extent consistent with general considerations of safety and soundness  provided that such payments do not adversely affect the bank s or the company s financial condition and are not overly restrictive to its growth capacity 
however  the bank experienced significant growth in  due mainly to its acquisition of sierra national bank in may of that year  and also had a slight contraction in earnings in the calendar year 
in light of these events  the board of directors declared dividends in totaling only approximately of the prior year earnings 
the company anticipates paying dividends in the future consistent with the general dividend policy as described above 
however  no assurance can be given that the bank s and the company s future earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 
the power of the bank s board of directors to declare cash dividends is also limited by statutory and regulatory restrictions which restrict the amount available for cash dividends depending upon the earnings  financial condition and cash needs of the bank  as well as general business conditions 
under california banking law  the bank may declare dividends in an amount not exceeding the lesser of its retained earnings or its net income for the last three years reduced by dividends paid during such period or  with the prior approval of the inasmuch as the company did not acquire the outstanding shares of the bank until august   the information contained herein for part of is for the bank s stock

the payment of any cash dividends by the bank will depend not only upon the bank s earnings during a specified period  but also on the bank meeting certain regulatory capital requirements 
the company s ability to pay dividends is also limited by state corporation law 
the california general corporation law prohibits the company from paying dividends on the common stock unless i its retained earnings  immediately prior to the dividend payment  equals or exceeds the amount of the dividend or ii immediately after giving effect to the dividend the sum of the company s assets exclusive of goodwill and deferred charges would be at least equal to of its liabilities not including deferred taxes  deferred income and other deferred liabilities and the current assets of the company would be at least equal to its current liabilities  or  if the average of its earnings before taxes on income and before interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years was less than the average of its interest expense for the two preceding fiscal years  at least equal to of its current liabilities

table of contents item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion presents management s analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company as of and for each of the years in the three year period ended december  the discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes related thereto presented elsewhere in this form k annual report see item below 
statements contained in this report that are not purely historical are forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of as amended  including the company s expectations  intentions  beliefs  or strategies regarding the future 
all forward looking statements concerning economic conditions  rates of growth  rates of income or values as may be included in this document are based on information available to the company on the date noted  and the company assumes no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
it is important to note that the company s actual results could materially differ from those in such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those in such forward looking statements are fluctuations in interest rates  inflation  government regulations  economic conditions  customer disintermediation and competitive product and pricing pressures in the geographic and business areas in which the company conducts its operations 
critical accounting policies the company s financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the financial information contained within these statements is  to a significant extent  based on approximate measures of the financial effects of transactions and events that have already occurred 
critical accounting policies are those that involve the most complex and subjective decisions and assessments  and have the greatest potential impact on the company s stated results of operations 
in management s opinion  the company s critical accounting policies deal with the following areas the establishment of the company s allowance for loan losses  as explained in detail in the provision for loan losses and allowance for loan losses sections of this discussion and analysis  the annual evaluation of goodwill for impairment as more fully described in part i  item under recent accounting pronouncements  and the accrual of the company s tax liability  particularly as it relates to the inclusion of benefits from the reit  as detailed in the section on income taxes in this discussion and analysis 
summary of performance the strong improvement in earnings that was realized in provided momentum for another record year in  with the company again achieving its highest net income ever 
in fact  net income has increased in of the last years 
net income in was million  an increase of nearly million  or  over net earnings recognized in net income in was million  an increase of million  or  over net earnings of million 
net income per basic share was for  as compared to during and in the company s return on average assets roa was and return on average equity roe was in  as compared to and  respectively in  and 
and  respectively for as is typical in many community banks  the company s interest earning assets mature or reprice more quickly that its interest bearing liabilities  in aggregate  and a record drop in interest rates during had a negative impact on the company s net interest margin that year 
net income still increased in  however  primarily due to gains on the sale of investment securities  gains on the sale of loan servicing  a lower loan loss provision  and the implementation of more stringent expense controls 
in the largest gain was in net as the holding company reorganization pursuant to which the company became the sole shareholder of the bank was effective in august   all financial information as of and for the years ended december  and any earlier years or periods relates to the bank rather than the company 
information as of and for the years ended december  and is provided for the bank and the company on a consolidated basis 

table of contents interest income  which increased not only because of million growth in average earning assets but also as the result of a basis point improvement in the company s net interest margin 
the net interest margin increased mainly because of a relatively stable interest rate environment during most of that allowed the company to maintain its cost of funds at record low levels 
other core income components also showed healthy improvement in  although total non interest income was lower due to the non recurring gains realized in non interest expenses were held to a increase in despite the additional expenses associated with a conversion to in house item processing and the relocation of the company s mis group 
the provision for loan losses  however  increased by million  largely as a result of growth in the company s loan portfolio but also due to a higher level of charge offs  higher average non accrual balances  and weakness in agricultural sectors of the local economy 
additionally  despite a million increase in pre tax income from to  the company s provision for income taxes was  lower in than in enterprise zone interest deductions and low income housing investment tax credits have had an impact  but the substantial reduction in the tax provision in was mainly due to the tax benefit derived from the company s real estate investment trust reit that was capitalized in august of no assurance can be given that the tax benefits produced by the reit in will continue to be available in the future  however  and it is conceivable but unlikely that a reinterpretation of existing tax laws by the california legislature could require that the tax benefits already realized from the reit be reversed 
the company s total assets grew by million  or  from million at the end of to million at the end of loan balances showed a relatively modest increase of million during  although average loan balances for the year increased by million due to significant growth in the last quarter of cash and due from banks was up by nearly million at december  relative to december  however  this was a temporary condition created by delayed credit in our federal reserve bank account for cash items presented for collection  and the balance of cash and due from banks has subsequently dropped by over million to close to its million average balance for another important shift in the composition of the company s balance sheet was a million increase in other assets  which jumped to of total assets at december  from at the end of this increase was due to a million investment in low income housing tax credit funds in may  and a million investment in bank owned life insurance boli in september  both of which enhance profitability but neither of which is classified as an interest earning asset 
the most notable change in deposits since december  was a million increase in time deposits over  this mainly represents the addition of brokered deposits to replace overnight borrowings from the federal home loan bank  which declined by million 
this is considered by management to be an interim measure to take advantage of relatively low rates in the wholesale deposit market and improve the company s shorter term liquidity 
in the longer term  the company anticipates replacing these brokered deposits with core deposits generated in its branches 
although no assurance can be given that this will happen  core deposits did increase by million  or  from the end of to the end of furthermore  there was a significant shift among core deposit balances from time deposits under  which declined by million  into money market accounts and non interest bearing transaction accounts  which increased by million and million  respectively 
it is management s sentiment that the increase in core deposits was due in large part to volatility in equity markets  and that continued uncertainty presents further opportunity to encourage migration into the company s relatively stable deposit products 
the company s current marketing campaigns are directed at taking advantage of this situation  although no assurance can be given that further increases in core deposits will indeed be realized 
another funding source is represented by securities sold under agreement to repurchase repo s  which is the investment vehicle for customer sweep account arrangements 
repo balances declined by almost million from the end of to the end of  due in part to certain repo customers transferring balances to slightly higher yielding money market deposit accounts 
the company also had million in fed funds purchased at december   however  as the balance of items in process of collection has been reduced and core 
table of contents deposit balances have increased  the need for these temporary short term funds has subsequently been eliminated 
due primarily to the retention of earnings  the company s total shareholders equity increased from million at december  to million at december  this is an increase of million  or about 
the company s total risk based capital ratio at december  was 
results of operations during the company generated net income of million as compared to million in and million in the company earns income from two primary sources 
the first is net interest income brought about by income from the successful deployment of earning assets less the costs of interest bearing liabilities 
the second is non interest income  which generally comes from customer service charges and fees  but can also result from non customer sources such as gains on loan sales and gains on sales from the company s investment portfolio 
the majority of the company s non interest expenses are operating costs that relate to providing a full range of banking services to our customers 
net interest income and net interest margin net interest income  which is simply total interest income including fees less total interest expense  was million in compared to million and million in and  respectively 
this represents an increase of in over and an increase of in over the level of net interest income depends on several factors  including yields on earning assets  the cost of interest bearing liabilities  the relative volume of total earning assets and total interest bearing liabilities  and the mix of products which comprise the company s earning assets  deposits  and other interest bearing liabilities 
any change in the amount and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities is referred to as volume change 
a change in interest rates earned on assets and rates paid on deposits and other borrowed funds is referred to as rate change 
the volume and rate variances table which follows sets forth the dollar amount of changes in interest earned and paid for each major category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the amount of change attributable to changes in average balances volume or changes in average interest rates 
the change due to an increase or decrease in volume is equal to the change in the average balance times the prior period rate  whereas the change due to an increase or decrease in the rate is equal to the change in the average rate times the current period balance 
the variances attributable to both the volume and rate changes have been allocated to the change in rate

december    and respectively 
loans are gross of the allowance for possible loan losses  deferred fees and related direct cost 
d represents net interest income as a percentage of average interest earning assets 
e non accrual loans have been included in total loans for purposes of total earning assets 
during most of the drop in interest rates had a negative impact on the company s net interest margin  although toward the end of and throughout the net interest margin rebounded 
a substantial portion of the company s earning assets are variable rate loans that re price immediately when interest rates fluctuate  versus a large base of core deposits which are generally slower to re price 
this created timing differences for most of as interest income fell more rapidly than interest expense 
exacerbating the timing effect was the narrowing of the relative spread between loan and deposit rates as market rates moved significantly lower 

table of contents the company s net interest margin improved toward year end  however  due to floors on loan rates and aggressive reductions in the pricing of deposit products 
demand for deposits has proven to be relatively inelastic  possibly because insured bank deposits are currently viewed as a safe haven relative to alternative investment products 
however  as depositors feel more secure with alternative investments the company could be forced to pay increasingly more for deposits to avoid potential run off  even if other interest rates remain static 
the improvement in the company s net interest margin was sustained in  as market interest rates remained relatively stable for most of the year 
a positive factor impacting the company s net interest margin in both and was a favorable shift in the mix of the company s deposits and other interest bearing liabilities 
the company ran an advertising campaign targeting variable rate money market deposits early in  which attracted new depositors and enticed some existing customers with maturing time deposits to roll their money into money market accounts 
money market account annual average balances increased by million in  and by another million in the initial increases were stimulated by relatively high promotional rates  however balances continued to increase even after rates paid on the company s money market accounts were reduced to levels at or below competitor rates 
substantial increases have also been seen in average now and savings account balances  which increased by million and million  respectively  from to additionally  average demand deposit balances increased by million from to  and by million from to average time deposit balances fell by million from to  and again by million from to time deposit balances would have fallen by substantially more if the company had not added million in broker deposits in early that were reflected on the balance sheet for most of the year 
the changes in customer deposit balances are presumably due in large part to uncertainty in equity markets  and the desire of our customers to minimize their risk of principal loss and keep their money in liquid investments 
the net result of the changes in the mix of average deposits was that relatively more costly time deposits declined from of average total deposits in to in  while other lower cost interest bearing deposits increased from to of average total deposits 
in  time certificates of deposit had a weighted average cost of  while money market  savings  and now accounts had a weighted average cost of 
non interest bearing demand deposits also increased from to of average total deposits from to also impacting the net interest margin was the addition of million in trust preferred securities in late november the impact on the company s net interest margin in was negligible  however the results of operation reflect a full year of interest on the trups at a cost of 
if the million in trups had  instead  been fed funds purchased  the company s net interest margin would likely have been about basis points higher than it actually was in from to  the company s average loan portfolio grew by approximately million  or  with earnings on that growth  net of associated funding costs  contributing to net interest income 
the increase in annual average balances is significantly higher than the million increase in actual balances from the end of to the end of  since most of the growth in occurred in the last two months of the year 
additionally  loan balances  which are the highest yielding component of the company s earning assets  have become a larger portion of the company s average asset base  increasing from of average assets in to in the reverse of this trend is that average investment balances have declined relative to total assets  from in  to in and in despite their decline relative to total assets  a shifting of investment balances into higher yielding mortgage backed securities and municipal bonds from treasury and agency bonds has also helped support the company s net interest margin 
another factor that had a slight negative effect on the company s net interest margin in the fourth quarter of and will continue to have a similar impact going forward is the increase in other non earning assets 
the company s boli and low income housing tax credit funds now total more than million 
these assets  while having a positive impact on the company s profitability with expected tax equivalent returns in the to range  are technically not interest earning assets 
their returns are not included as interest income  yet they are funded for the most part with interest bearing liabilities and thus these balances ultimately have a negative impact on the company s net interest margin 
management estimates that this impact in should not be more than a few basis points  although it would become more significant in a rising rate environment 

table of contents this will be more than offset by increases in other income from gains in the net cash surrender value of boli and tax credits generated by the low income housing tax credit funds  however 
based on current economic conditions  the company expects only moderate changes in the rates paid on interest bearing liabilities and rates earned on both the investment and loan portfolios during the company s net interest margin is anticipated to stay approximately the same as in  and net interest income should increase if loans grow as planned and the loan growth is funded by reasonably priced deposits 
however  no assurance can be given that this will  in fact  occur 
non interest income and non interest expense the following table sets forth the various components of the company s non interest income and non interest expense for the years indicated non interest income expense dollars in thousands  unaudited of total of total of total other operating income service charges on deposit accounts credit card fees other service charges  commissions fees gains on sales of loans loan servicing income gains on sale of investment securities other total non interest income as a percentage of average earning assets other operating expenses salaries and employee benefits occupancy costs furniture equipment premises advertising and marketing costs data processing costs item processing costs other data processing deposit services costs loan services costs loan processing ore owned credit card other loan services other operating costs telephone data communications postage mail other professional services costs legal accounting other professional service stationery supply costs sundry tellers total non interest expense as a of average earning assets net non interest income as a of earning assets 
table of contents the primary traditional sources of non interest income for the company include the following service charges on deposit accounts  other service charges  commissions  and fees including atm fees  check card interchange fees  boli income  and other miscellaneous income  gains on the sale of loans  loan servicing income  and credit card fees 
during  the company also realized substantial gains on the sale of investment securities  and from the sale of loan servicing rights it had retained on previously sold residential mortgage loans 
loan sale and loan servicing income is becoming less significant to the company  while service charges on deposits  other service charges and fees  and credit card fees are becoming increasingly important components of non interest income 
excluding non recurring gains on loan servicing of approximately  in and taking investment gains out of the equation  combined loan sale and servicing income fell from of recurring non interest income in to in using the same denominator  service charges on deposits increased from in to in  other service charges  commissions and fees increased from to  and credit card fees increased from to 
the most significant source of non interest income to the company continues to be service charges on deposit accounts  which totaled million in  million in  and million in this income increased by  or  from to  and by  or  from to the company s ratio of service charge income to average transaction accounts demand and interest bearing now accounts was in  as compared to in and for the increase from to and is indicative of operational changes enacted in recent years to generate additional non sufficient funds charges and a higher level of collected versus waived activity charges 
other service charges  commissions  and fees also constitute a substantial portion of non interest income  and totaled million in   in  and  in the increase from to can largely be explained by increases in boli income and check card interchange fees  and likewise the bulk of the increase from to was the result of additional boli income and higher check card interchange fees 
boli income  which is not taxable  is generated by the increase in the cash surrender values of bank owned life insurance policies net of the cost of the associated insurance benefits and certain consulting expenses 
boli income is expected to increase again by approximately  in  which will reflect a full year of income from the million boli purchase made in september and october of moneyline referral fees  which are discussed in greater detail in the next paragraph  supplemented the increase in other service charges  commissions  and fees in income from loan sales was  in   in  and  in loan sale income increased by  or  from to as a larger volume of mortgage loans were booked and sold 
the relatively high level of mortgage loan activity in was prompted by a significant drop in mortgage rates  and this momentum carried over into the first quarter of as well 
in march  however  the company restructured its mortgage lending group to reduce expenses and began outsourcing residential mortgage loan origination services to moneyline 
since that time loan sale income has fallen to an annualized level of slightly over  per year 
referral fees from moneyline are reflected in other service charges  commissions and fees and totaled approximately  in  but are expected to increase to approximately  in moneyline fees are dependent on the volume of closed residential mortgage loans  though  and no assurance can be given that this level of income will be realized 
loan servicing income reached unusual levels in  when non recurring gains of approximately  were realized on the sale of the loan servicing rights the company had retained on previously sold residential mortgage loans 
pursuant to a detailed analysis of the loan servicing area  management determined that loan servicing revenue was not sufficient to cover associated costs and maintain a reasonable profit margin  and decided to sell the servicing rights on its residential loan servicing portfolio 
with the sale of most of the company s loan servicing portfolio  recurring loan servicing income excluding one time gains dropped off substantially in and was only  compared to approximately  in and  in  although associated expenses also declined 
credit card fees increased by  or  from to  but expanded more significantly in with the addition of an annual fee for participation in the company s score card program 
from to 
table of contents credit card fees increased by  or  growing from  to  with no plans for significant growth in credit card receivables  it is expected that credit card fees will stay at about the same level in the  gain on investment securities in is primarily comprised of liquidating dividends resulting from the company s investment in sphinx  as that company is winding down operations 
the gain is net of the write off of the remaining  book value of that equity investment 
gains on investments were significantly higher in than in either or the decline in market interest rates in had the effect of increasing the market value of the company s investment portfolio  which is substantially comprised of fixed rate bonds  and the company was able to realize some of those gains as bonds were sold during the year 
management determined at the beginning of that the portfolio should be repositioned to improve its total return  by reducing the overall size of the portfolio and moving balances from lower yielding treasuries and agencies into municipal bonds and mortgage backed securities 
as bonds were sold during the course of in pursuit of that strategy  the company realized gains totaling approximately million  compared to  in the company s total non interest expense excluding the provision for loan losses increased to million in  compared to million in and million in the  or  increase in non interest expenses in is mainly the result of the conversion to in house item processing and other technology enhancements 
the million  or  overall increase in non interest expenses in was due in large part to the company s acquisition of snb in may of in a full year of the post acquisition increase in operating expenses is reflected in the company s income statement  whereas in only those expenses subsequent to the acquisition date are included 
while non interest expenses increased from of average earning assets in to in  they subsequently declined to of average earning assets in the largest dollar increase in for any single non interest expense category was in salaries and employee benefits  which increased by  or  to million 
these expenses increased only slightly relative to total non interest expenses  however  going from in to in  which is still below the ratio of 
salaries and benefits for item processing staff which came on board in july and august of totaled about  for the year 
additionally  technology staff was added to provide support for item processing  atm processing  information security  internal reporting  network operations  and desktop applications 
this additional staffing is estimated to have increased salaries and employee benefits by about  in also impacting expenses in was a decrease in the credit taken against salaries for fas loan origination costs 
costs  primarily salaries  that are directly associated with originating loans are taken out of current period expenses and amortized over the life of the loan as a reduction of loan fee income 
because origination activity slowed substantially in the latter part of  due in part to the outsourcing of home mortgage loans  the credit to current period expenses dropped by  the increase for also includes approximately  in accruals for a salary continuation plan for certain key employees that was adopted effective october st in conjunction with the company s purchase of boli 
these accruals are expected to be approximately  in the remainder of the increase can be explained by selective strategic staff additions in our branches to enhance business development activities  salary increases in the normal course of business  and rising benefits costs 
in salaries and benefits totaled million  which represents an increase of  or  relative to million in the main reason for the increase in salaries and benefits in is because it reflects a full year of the additional expense associated with staffing the four offices added through the snb acquisition 
based on market analysis and peer comparisons  it is management s opinion that the company can achieve future growth in loans and deposits with only minimal increases in staff 
thus  it is expected that salaries and employee benefits will decline as a percentage of earning assets over the next few years  although there is no guaranty that this will actually occur 
the number of full time equivalent employees was at the end of  at the end of  and at the end of total rent and occupancy costs  including furniture and equipment expenses  were million in  million in  and million in the increase in these expenses totaled  or  in  
table of contents and  or  in approximately  of the increase in can be directly attributed to the in house item processing operation  in the form of rent for the additional space and depreciation on the equipment and tenant improvements utilized by our new item processing group 
our data processing operations also moved to the same building utilized by item processing  further increasing rent expense  and technology initiatives including comprehensive personal computer and server upgrades added to depreciation expenses 
and  despite cost control efforts in this area  the company s overall utilities costs increased by  due to the electricity rate increases experienced by most companies operating in california 
the main reason for the increase in rent and occupancy costs in is  again  because that year reflects a full year of the depreciation and other occupancy expenses associated with the four offices added through the snb acquisition 
there were also significant renovation and maintenance expenses incurred to bring the snb offices up to company standards 
data processing costs increased by  or  to a total of million in of this increase   was in additional costs related to the company s core processing system and  was for other software costs 
item processing outsourcing costs only increased by  but these costs totaled nearly million for the year 
outsourcing costs for item processing should be completely eliminated in due to the in house conversion  and even after factoring in the additional costs associated with the in house solution  management anticipates that the company will reduce total item processing related expenses by around  per year commencing in no assurance can be given  however  that this level of savings will actually be realized 
aggregate data processing costs also experienced a significant increase from to  climbing from million to million 
this increase was centered in item processing costs  which grew by  due to the additional number of items processed in the cost of professional services was million in  million in  and million in while professional services expenses dropped by  or in  in these expenses were more that double their level 
included in professional services costs in are about  in costs associated with forming the holding company 
this category also includes payments to consultants for compliance  loan  and operations reviews  which increased by  in relative to due to the increased size and complexity of the company 
the bank s fdic assessment also increased by  in  due to the increase in the bank s assessable deposit base as well as the lower capital ratios that resulted from the snb acquisition 
the company s regulatory assessments subsequently declined by  in  since financial reports filed with regulators at the end of reflect improvement in the company s capital position 
lending related legal expenses were also approximately  lower in than in in the company also started accruing for the expected costs of a directors retirement plan adopted effective october st in conjunction with the purchase of boli 
these accruals added approximately  to professional services expenses in  and will be approximately  per year in the other operating costs category  which includes telecommunications  postage  and other costs totaled million in  million in  and million in these expenses increased by  or in  and by  or in the increase in includes approximately  in accruals for anticipated operating losses on the company s investments in low income housing tax credit funds 
the losses are an expected component of these investments  and are factored into the initial assessment of projected returns 
postage expenses also increased by  mainly because of increased customer communications costs relative to in house item processing and imaged statements 
these increases were partially offset by a  reduction in telecommunications expenses resulting from the restructuring of telephone and data line configurations and the renegotiation of certain contracts 
most of the increase in was in telephone and data communications costs  which increased subsequent to the snb acquisition but also increased as the company upgraded its communications technology 
we are increasingly focused on enhancing fee income and controlling overhead expenses to mitigate the potential effect of intensified competition on the company s net interest margin  and improvement is evident in the company s tax equivalent overhead efficiency ratios of for and for however  no assurance can be given that future reductions in the company s efficiency ratio can be achieved as planned 

table of contents provision for loan losses credit risk is inherent in the business of making loans 
the company sets aside an allowance or reserve for loan losses through charges to earnings  which are shown in the income statement as the provision for loan losses 
specifically identifiable and quantifiable losses are immediately charged off against the allowance 
the company s provision for loan losses was million in  million in  and million in the million increase in the provision in was due in large part to the million increase in average loan balances  but was also the result of a substantial increase in loan balances deemed likely to result in a loss and thus charged off 
net charge offs increased by million in relative to  as management was increasingly proactive in evaluating the company s loan portfolio and in aggressively identifying and resolving potential problem credits in light of continued recession like economic circumstances 
in the provision was reduced by million despite an increase in non performing loans 
a lower amount was added to the company s allowance for loan losses in because net charge offs fell by  and the allowance was maintained at a level determined to be appropriate subsequent to a thorough management review of the allowance relative to the company s current loan portfolio 
the loan loss provision is determined by conducting a monthly evaluation of the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses  and charging the shortfall  if any  to the current month s expense 
this has the effect of creating variability in the amount and frequency of charges to the company s earnings 
the procedures for monitoring the adequacy of the allowance  as well as detailed information concerning the allowance itself  are included below under allowance for loan losses 
income taxes in  the company s provision for state and federal income taxes was million  while the provision was million and million  respectively  for and this represents of income before taxes in  in  and in the company sets aside a provision for income taxes on a monthly basis 
as indicated in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  the amount of such provision is determined by applying the company s statutory income tax rates to pre tax book income as adjusted for permanent differences between pre tax book income and actual taxable income 
these permanent differences include but are not limited to tax exempt income  increases in the cash surrender value of boli  california enterprise zone deductions  certain expenses that are not allowed as tax deductions  and tax credits 
an additional permanent difference arose as a result of the formation of a real estate investment trust reit which began operations in august the reit was formed to provide the company with greater flexibility in managing its capital  but had the added benefit of providing california income tax benefits 
thus  the company adjusted its tax accrual effective august to allow for the year to date impact of the reit  and the tax accrual for was approximately  lower than it otherwise would have been 
no assurance can be given that the tax benefits available from the reit will continue to be available in the future  however 
in addition  there is a possibility that a future modification of existing tax laws by the california legislature could require that the tax benefits already realized from the reit be reversed  although in the opinion of management that is remote 
some items of income and expense are recognized in different years for tax purposes than when applying generally accepted accounting principles  leading to timing differences between the company s actual tax liability and the amount accrued for this liability based on book income 
these temporary differences comprise the deferred portion of the company s tax expense  which is accumulated on the company s books as a deferred tax asset or deferred tax liability until such time as it reverses 
most of the company s temporary differences involve recognizing more expenses in its financial statements than it has been allowed to deduct for taxes  and therefore the company s deferred tax asset typically exceeds its deferred tax liability 
at december  the company s  net deferred tax asset was primarily due to temporary differences in the reported allowance for loan losses  deferred compensation  and depreciation 

table of contents the company s income tax expense is also affected by income earned on tax exempt securities 
these securities are primarily the company s investments in state  county and municipal bonds  which averaged of the total investment portfolio in and in  and provided million in federal tax exempt income in and million in although not reflected in the investment portfolio  in the company committed to approximately million in wnc institutional tax credit fund x  a low income housing partnership  which should result in about million in net total tax credits over its year life 
in the company also committed to an approximate million investment in a similar tax credit fund  which should result in approximately million in net total tax credits 
about  of those credits should be available for the tax year  and about  of the tax credits were realized in in  it is expected that approximately  of these tax credits will be utilized 
all of the credits  however  are dependent upon the occupancy level of the housing projects and income of the tenants and cannot be projected with complete certainty 
in addition  in early the company reevaluated the interest income earned on its loans to companies whose operations are located in areas designated as enterprise zones by the state of california 
this interest income is partially exempt from california income taxes  and in the company accrued for  in total refunds of prior year taxes based on amended returns filed with the california franchise tax board 
these refunds are subject to audit by the california franchise tax board  however  and there is also no guaranty that the exemption can or will be sustained going forward 
financial condition a comparison between the summary year end balance sheets for through was presented previously in the table of selected financial data see item above 
as indicated in that table  the company s total assets  loans  and shareholders equity have grown each year for the past four years  with asset growth most pronounced in as a result of the acquisition of snb 
growth in the company s total assets over the past year approximated million  or  as compared to growth in of million  or  and growth in of million  or 
total assets were million and million at december  and  respectively 
a positive trend is also seen in the increase in loans  which are typically higher earning assets  relative to total earning assets every year since on the liability side  an increase in non interest bearing deposits relative to total deposits plus interest bearing liabilities from the end of to the end of should also help lower overall interest expense going forward  although no assurance can be given that this impact will be sustained 
loan portfolio the company s loan portfolio represents the single largest portion of invested assets  substantially greater than the investment portfolio or any other asset category  and the quality and diversification of the loan portfolio are important considerations when reviewing the company s results of operations 
at december   gross loans represented of total assets 
at december  and  gross loans were and of total assets  respectively 
since loans to assets actually averaged for  management does not feel that the drop from year end to year end is a reversal of the trend toward higher loans to assets 
rather  it is simply a factor of specific balance sheet conditions that existed at year end  including the year end inflation in assets caused by the temporary increase in cash and due from banks 
the ratio of loans to deposits also declined from at the end of to at the end of  however this was due to the addition of brokered deposits during to replace fhlb borrowings 
the selected financial data table in item above reflects the net amount of loans outstanding at december st for each year from through the loan distribution table that follows sets forth the amount of the company s total loans outstanding and the percentage distribution in each category at the dates indicated 
the amounts shown in the table are gross figures and do not include net deferred loan fees or net deferred loan origination costs

existing business units generated all of the company s loan growth in and  however about half of the company s total million loan growth during was due to the acquisition of snb 
the most significant shift in the loan portfolio mix over the past five years has been in real estate loans secured by commercial properties  which increased from of total loans at the end of to of total loans at the end of commercial real estate lending is an increasingly important part of the company s focus  and is likely to remain so for the immediate future 
demand for loans appears to be strong in some markets within the company s service area  despite apparent weak demand elsewhere in california and in the united states 
competition  however  has intensified locally  especially in the fresno and bakersfield markets 
the company s relatively modest loan growth of million  or  in was partially the result of the competitive environment  but was also due in part to changes in the company s residential mortgage lending process 
the company intends to address increased competition with a possible expansion of loan products and with an increase in loan oriented marketing 
overall  loan demand in the company s immediate market has been oriented toward loans secured by real estate  including commercial and professional buildings and single family dwellings  as well as commercial loans  including sba loans 
as a result  these areas have comprised the major portion of the company s loan growth over the past few years 
loans secured by real estate and commercial loans comprised and  respectively  of the company s total loan portfolio at the end of the largest percentage and volume growth for any major category of loans during came in loans secured by real estate  which increased by million  or 
real estate loans secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development loans actually increased by million  or  but this increase was partially offset by the million decline in residential mortgage loans resulting from the aforementioned restructuring of our mortgage lending group 

table of contents commercial loans  including sba loans  grew by million  or  during actually  all of this growth was in sba loans  which increased by when viewed separately 
the company s commercial loans are centered in locally oriented commercial activities in the markets where the company has a presence 
additionally  the company has a business unit dedicated to its sba product and is very active in specific sba program lending  and sells a number of the sba loans it originates 
further  the company is designated as an sba preferred lender  which allows greater flexibility to meet small business loan requests with a more timely credit approval process 
the company s dedication to sba lending was recently reaffirmed when bank of the sierra was named first in the sba s fresno california district for the dollar volume of sba loans produced  and second for the number of sba loans 
additionally  according to the fresno district office  the bank was the only financial institution to be among the top five sba lenders for the last four years 
consumer loans represented of total loans at december  and of total loans outstanding at december  these loans declined by million  or  during however  during they grew by million  or 
the growth in came primarily from the purchase of million in balances outstanding on unsecured lines of credit to high net worth individuals 
the purchase  from a los angeles area financial institution  was consummated in december of the remaining balances consist primarily of automobile and unsecured lines of credit  which have gained popularity due to their ease of use 
the company has encountered a great deal of competition for consumer lending products  and has developed a program for lending to people rather than lending on property 
as a result  relationship lending has increased as a portion of overall consumer credit  and is exemplified by home equity lines  other revolving consumer credit facilities and credit card lines 
however  a great deal of consumer credit is now granted in the form of home equity lines  which allow a more favorable treatment of interest costs 
as a result  consumer credit separately reported is only for term debt and unsecured lines and does not include home equity lines  a more growth oriented category 
such consumer oriented debt  secured by home equity  is captured within the total reported for real estate loans secured by residential property 
agricultural loans dropped to of the company s total loan balances at the end of from at the end of the decline in agricultural loans over the past few years has been due in part to the december freeze  along with reduced local plantings due to foreign competition 
however  the company has also withdrawn from financing production lines  where year to year cash flow variations can impede the ability of borrowers to meet contractual repayment terms 
with uncertain commodity prices  our borrowers have faced declining equity in farming operations  and some are removing themselves from farming by selling land for housing and other development 
credit card loans also represented just of total loans outstanding at december   having declined from of total loans at december  despite this decrease  the credit card segment of the company s loan product group remains an important part of the company s overall customer relationship lending strategy 
another important aspect of the company s loan business has been that of residential real estate loans which  up until march of  were generated internally by the real estate mortgage loan department and ultimately sold in the secondary market to government sponsored enterprises or other long term lenders 
the company originated and sold aggregate balances of approximately million of such loans during  an increase from the million originated and sold in this changed in march  when the company began to earn referral fees for directing most of its residential mortgage customers to moneyline but ceased originating and selling those loans itself 
from march through december  the company referred a total of million in successfully completed mortgage loans to moneyline 
the company also originates and sells agricultural mortgage loans to certain other investors  and the volume of these loans serviced totaled million as of december  total loans serviced for others numbered with an aggregate balance of million at the end of  as compared to loans with an aggregate balance of million at december and  loans with an aggregate balance of million at the end of because the company is not involved with chemicals or toxins that might have an adverse effect on the environment  its primary exposure to environmental legislation is through its lending activities 
the 
table of contents company s lending procedures include steps to identify and monitor this exposure to avoid any significant loss or liability related to environmental regulations 
loan maturities the following loan maturity table shows the amounts of total loans and leases outstanding as of december   which  based on remaining scheduled repayments of principal  are due within three months  after three months but less than one year  after one but within five years  and in more than five years 
the principal balance of loans due after one year is indicated by both fixed and floating rate categories 
non accrual loans are intermixed within each category 
loan maturity dollars in thousands as of december  three months or less three months thru twelve months one to five years over five years total floating rate due after one year fixed rate due after one year agricultural commercial and industrial real estate consumer loans credit cards total includes small business administration loans this schedule can be used in combination with the investment maturities table in the investment securities section and the deposit maturities table in the deposits section to identify time periods with potential liquidity exposure 
the referenced maturity schedules do not convey a complete picture of the company s re pricing exposure or interest rate risk  however 
for details on the re pricing characteristics of the company s balance sheet and a more comprehensive discussion of the company s sensitivity to changes in interest rates  see the liquidity and market risk section 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of business  the company makes commitments to extend credit to its customers as long as there are no violations of any conditions established in contractual arrangements 
these commitments are obligations that represent a potential credit risk to the company  yet are not reflected in any form within the company s consolidated balance sheets 
total unused commitments to extend credit were million at december  as compared to million at december  net of credit card lines available which were million and million at december  and  unused commitments represented and of outstanding gross loans at december  and  respectively 
the company s stand by letters of credit at december   and were million and million  respectively 
the effect on the company s revenues  expenses  cash flows and liquidity from the unused portion of the commitments to provide credit cannot be reasonably predicted because there is no guarantee that the lines of credit will ever be used

non performing assets banks have generally suffered their most severe earnings declines as a result of customers inability to generate sufficient cash flow to service their debts  or as a result of the downturns in national and regional economies which have brought about declines in overall property values 
in addition  certain investments that the company may purchase have the potential of becoming less valuable if the obligor s financial capacity to repay deteriorates 
an institution has a certain level of exposure to asset quality risk and could obtain less than full repayment of an obligation because of the potential for these types of failures 
since loans are the most 
table of contents significant assets of the company and generate the largest portion of its revenues  the company s management of asset quality risk is focused primarily on loan quality 
the company achieves a certain level of loan quality by establishing a sound credit plan  which includes well defined goals and objectives and well documented credit policies and procedures 
these policies and procedures identify market segments  set goals for portfolio growth or contraction  and establish limits on industry and geographic credit concentrations 
in addition  these policies establish the company s underwriting standards and the methods of monitoring ongoing credit quality 
the company s internal credit risk controls are centered in underwriting practices  credit granting procedures  training  risk management techniques  and familiarity with our loan customers as well as the relative diversity and geographic concentration of our loan portfolio 
unfortunately  the company s credit risk may also be affected by external factors such as the level of interest rates  employment  general economic conditions  real estate values  and trends in particular industries or geographic markets 
as a multi community  independent bank headquartered in and serving tulare county with a smaller presence in each of kern  fresno and kings counties  the company must contend with the attendant vagaries of the california and san joaquin valley markets 
the company s asset quality has suffered during the last several years due to the impact of national and regional economic recessions  consumer bankruptcies  weather related agricultural loan losses  and depressed prices for agricultural goods 
the san joaquin valley  however  may be experiencing a slow but sustained economic recovery  and appears poised for industrial and residential growth even as the agricultural industry remains weak 
the company is optimistic that the local economy will improve over time  but no assurance can be given that such improvement will in fact occur 
non performing assets are comprised of the following loans for which the company is no longer accruing interest  loans days or more past due and still accruing interest although loans are generally placed on non accrual when they become days past due  loans restructured where the terms of repayment have been renegotiated resulting in a deferral of interest or principal  and other real estate owned oreo 
management s classification of a loan as non accrual is an indication that there is reasonable doubt as to the full collectibility of principal or interest on the loan 
at that point  the company stops accruing income from the interest on the loan  reverses any uncollected interest that had been accrued but unpaid  and recognizes interest income only as cash interest payments are received and as long as the collection of all outstanding principal is not in doubt 
these loans may or may not be collateralized  but collection efforts are continuously pursued 
loans may be restructured by management when a borrower has experienced some change in financial status causing an inability to meet the original repayment terms and where the company believes the borrower will eventually overcome those circumstances and repay the loan in full 
oreo consists of properties acquired by foreclosure or similar means that management intends to offer for sale 
the following table provides information with respect to components of the company s non performing assets at the date indicated 

table of contents non performing assets dollars in thousands as of december  nonaccrual loans agricultural commercial and industrial real estate secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development secured by residential properties secured by farmland held for sale total real estate small business administration loans consumer loans credit cards subtotal loans days or more past due still accruing as to principal or interest agricultural commercial and industrial real estate secured by commercial professional office properties including construction and development secured by residential properties secured by farmland held for sale total real estate small business administration loans consumer loans credit cards subtotal total non performing loans other real estate owned total nonperforming assets restructured loans n a n a n a n a n a nonperforming loans as of total gross loans nonperforming assets as a of total gross loans and other real estate owned additional interest income of approximately  would have been recorded for the year ended december  if these loans had been paid in accordance with their original terms and had been outstanding throughout the applicable period then ended or  if not outstanding throughout the applicable period then ended  since origination 
a restructured loan is one where the terms were renegotiated to provide a reduction or deferral of interest or principal because of a deterioration in the financial position of the borrower 
total non performing balances stood at million at the end of  with approximately of those balances being agriculture related 
this represents a decline of million  or  from year end levels 
non performing assets to total gross loans plus oreo also declined for the same period  dropping to at the end of from at the end of this was due in part to the favorable resolution of certain problem credits 
however  much of the decline was simply due to the level of net loan balances charged off  which increased by million from to as the company has taken a more proactive approach to identifying and aggressively charging off loans when losses appear imminent see allowance for loan losses 
net charge offs increased to 
of average loans in from 
in and 
in the company s long term average through for this ratio is approximately  although no assurance can be given that the average will remain at this level in the future 
the company s non performing assets increased by million during primarily due to the placement on non accrual status 
table of contents of million in loans to a single borrower  although the company s exposure to that borrower has subsequently declined and only million remained on non accrual at december  a mitigating factor when evaluating the company s non performing loans is that million  or  of the total million balance at year end is secured by real estate  and an additional million  or  is comprised of the guaranteed portion of loans that are backed by the us government 
the company anticipates influxes of non accrual loans in the normal course of business as it further increases its lending activities and borrower performance issues periodically arise 
it also expects to acquire some level of other real estate as collection activities are undertaken to resolve problem and non accrual credits 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is established through a provision for loan losses based on management s evaluation of known and inherent risk in the company s loan portfolio 
the allowance is increased by provisions charged against current earnings  and reduced by net charge offs 
loans are charged off when they are deemed to be uncollectable  recoveries are generally recorded only when cash payments are received subsequent to the charge off 
we employ a systematic methodology for determining the allowance for loan losses that includes a monthly review process and monthly adjustment of the allowance 
our process includes a periodic review of individual loans that have been specifically identified as problem loans or have characteristics that could lead to impairment  as well as detailed reviews of other loans either individually or in pools 
while this methodology utilizes historical and other objective information  the establishment of the allowance for loan losses and the classification of loans is also to some extent based on management s judgment and experience 
our methodology incorporates a variety of risk considerations  both quantitative and qualitative  in establishing an allowance for loan losses that management believes is appropriate at each reporting date 
quantitative factors include our historical loss experience  delinquency and charge off trends  collateral values  changes in non performing loans  and other factors 
quantitative factors also incorporate known information about individual loans  including borrowers sensitivity to interest rate movements and borrowers sensitivity to quantifiable external factors including commodity prices as well as acts of nature freezes  earthquakes  fires  etc 
that occur in a particular period 
qualitative factors include the general economic environment in our markets and  in particular  the state of the agriculture industry and other key industries in the central san joaquin valley 
the way a particular loan might be structured  the extent and nature of waivers of existing loan policies  the results of bank regulatory examination  model imprecision  and the rate of portfolio growth are additional qualitative factors that are considered 
the table which follows summarizes the activity in the allowance for loan losses for the years indicated 
table of contents allowance for loan losses dollars in thousands as of december  balances average gross loans outstanding during period gross loans outstanding at end of period allowance for loan losses balance at beginning of period adjustments provision charged to expense loan charge offs agricultural commercial industrial loans real estate loans consumer loans credit card loans total recoveries agricultural commercial industrial loans real estate loans consumer loans credit card loans total net loan charge offs balance at end of period ratios net loan charge offs to average loans allowance for loan losses to gross loans at end of period allowance for loan losses to non performing loans net loan charge offs to allowance for loan losses at end of period net loan charge offs to provision for loan losses allowance acquired from sierra national bank includes small business administration loans 
at december   the company s allowance for loan losses was million 
the loan loss provisions in   and totaled million  million  and million respectively 
although the provision was significantly higher  net loans charged off in were also million higher than in  thus the allowance for loan losses increased by only  during net loan charge offs in were million  or of average loans  compared to  or 
of average loans in the dollar amount of loans charged off in increased significantly for consumer  commercial and industrial c i  and agricultural loans 
the increase in consumer loan charge offs consists mainly of certain of the unsecured lines of credit purchased by the company in late specifically  some of the lines were to technology sector executives who became unable to meet contractual repayment terms subsequent to the purchase 
the c i loan charge offs are primarily the result of management s proactive efforts to identify and aggressively pursue resolution of lingering problem loans 
about one third of the c i charge offs were loans to companies 
table of contents in construction related businesses that experienced difficulties due to competitive pressures and inefficient management 
the remainder of the c i charge offs are split fairly evenly among transportation  agriculture related  healthcare  and retail service businesses 
many of the problems faced by the agriculture related companies are linked to current market conditions 
the trucking companies difficulties are also economic in nature and can be traced back to september  the increase in agricultural loans charged off can be explained by certain loans to a single borrower that were placed on non accrual in and were ultimately deemed to be uncollectible 
the allowance as a percentage of total loans at year end versus declined only negligibly  from to  despite the increase in loan balances and the substantial decrease in the ratio of non performing loans to total loans from to see non performing assets above 
the relatively large decline in non performing loans also caused the allowance to increase from of non performing loans at the end of to at the end of our methodology for determining the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses is  and has been  consistently followed 
however  as we add new products  increase in complexity  and expand our geographic coverage  we expect to enhance our methodology to keep pace with the size and complexity of the loan portfolio 
on an ongoing basis we engage outside firms to independently assess our methodology  and to perform independent credit reviews of our loan portfolio 
the company s external auditors  the fdic  and the california department of financial institutions also review the allowance for loan losses as an integral part of the examination processes 
management believes that the current methodology is appropriate given our size and level of complexity 
further  management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate as of december  to cover known and inherent risks in the loan portfolio 
however  fluctuations in credit quality  or changes in economic conditions or other factors could cause management to increase or decrease the allowance for loan losses as necessary  and no assurance can be given that such factors may not result in increased losses in the loan portfolio in the future 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific loan categories at the dates indicated 
the allocation presented should not be interpreted as an indication that charges to the allowance for loan losses will be incurred in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category represents the total amounts available for charge offs that may occur within these categories

investment portfolio the investment securities portfolio had a book value of million at december  it is the second largest component of the company s earning assets  and the structure and composition of this portfolio is significant to any analysis of the financial condition of the company 
the company makes available two portfolios for the classification of its investments held to maturity  and available for sale 
while provision is also made for a trading portfolio classification  the company has no investments that are classified as such 
the held to maturity portfolio can consist only of investments that the company has both the intention and ability to hold until maturity  to be sold only in the event of concerns with an issuer s credit worthiness  a 
table of contents change in tax law that eliminates their tax exempt status or other infrequent situations as permitted by generally accepted accounting principles 
prior to  the company s long term tax exempt obligations and certain pledged treasury and agency issues were classified as held to maturity 
during the fourth quarter of  however  the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  which afforded the opportunity to reclassify some or all of the company s investments 
upon adoption of this statement  the company reclassified substantially all of its investments from the held to maturity portfolio to the available for sale portfolio to allow more flexibility with regard to the active management of its investment securities 
as a result  the company s unrecorded potential increase in the market value of the reclassified bonds  net of the tax effect  was recorded on the balance sheet as an increase in accumulated other comprehensive income 
the investment portfolio serves the following purposes it provides liquidity to even out cash flows from the loan and deposit activities of customers  it provides a source of pledged assets for securing public deposits and borrowed funds  it provides a large base of assets  the maturity and interest rate characteristics of which can be changed more readily than the loan portfolio to better match changes in the deposit base and other funding sources of the company  it is an alternative interest earning use of funds when loan demand is weak  and it can enhance the company s tax position by providing partially tax exempt income 
the company s investment portfolio is currently composed primarily of us treasury and agency issues for liquidity and pledging  mortgage backed securities to enhance the yield of the portfolio  state  county and municipal obligations which provide limited tax free income and pledging potential  and other equity investments 
the fourth category includes an equity investment in farmer mac stock  which is a required element to allow the company to sell certain agricultural loans to this quasi governmental agency 
in the relative distribution of these groups within the overall portfolio changed slightly  with us treasury and agency bonds declining to of the portfolio in from in  and mortgage backed securities increasing to in from in with the relatively low yield environment in  maturing bonds were replaced when possible with short duration higher yielding mortgage backed securities 
still  as can be seen on the distribution  rate yield table presented in a previous section  the average yield earned on total investments declined from to 
the distribution of investments changed substantially in  with a shift out of treasuries and agencies and into mortgage backed securities and municipal obligations 
municipal obligations remain the largest portion of the total portfolio at  up from at the end of treasuries and agencies together comprised of total investments at the end of  down from at the end of  while mortgage backed securities increased proportionate to total investments in  to from 
this movement away from pure liquidity instruments into higher yielding bonds with a higher perceived risk and a longer duration helped the company minimize the impact of declining interest rates on the yield of the portfolio 
the portfolio yield fell to in from in  a drop of only basis points despite the federal reserve s basis point reduction in the fed funds rate during the year 
the following investment portfolio table reflects the amortized cost and fair market values for the total portfolio for each of the categories of investments for the past three years

this was allowed to occur because the company has enhanced its liquidity resources with the net cash surrender value of bank owned life insurance  access to multiple brokered cd programs  and expanded overnight fed funds borrowing lines 
we thus did not feel pressured to replace all maturing bonds in a historically low interest rate environment 
in the investment portfolio was also substantially reduced in size  dropping to million at the end of the year from its starting balance of million 
the aggregate million reduction in investment portfolio balances from the end of to the end of has added to the positive impact of rising loan balances on the company s net interest margin  when viewing both categories relative to interest earning assets 
while loans are generally higher yielding instruments and their increased weighting enhances the company s yield on earning assets  management does not anticipate letting investment balances drop further relative to total earning assets due to the investment portfolio s preferential liquidity and risk characteristics 
securities pledged as collateral on repurchase agreements  public deposits and for other purposes as required or permitted by law were million and million  for december  and  respectively 
the investment maturities table below summarizes the maturity of the company s investment securities and their weighted average yields at december  expected remaining maturities may differ from remaining contractual maturities because obligors may have the right to repay certain obligations with or without penalties

cash and due from banks cash on hand and balances due from correspondent banks represent the major portion of the company s non earning assets 
at december  cash and due from banks comprised of total assets  compared to of total assets at december  the increase of million  or  on december  relative to the end of was caused by the federal reserve bank of san francisco s failure to provide proper credit to the company for cash items presented for collection 
that situation was subsequently resolved and the balance of cash and due from banks at the end of january was down to million un audited  below its annual average of about million for 
table of contents the company is exerting ongoing efforts to reduce non earning cash balances relative to interest earning assets  and during installed a software solution to help reduce its cash reserve requirements at the federal reserve bank 
these efforts will continue in with a focus on the reduction of vault cash 
a system to more closely monitor branch cash balances has been implemented  and the possibility of a central cash vault is being explored 
despite these efforts  there are geographic limitations to our ability to reduce the number of cash items in process of collection  as the company s operating branches lie at the extreme southern end of the federal reserve bank frb of san francisco s responsibility area for check clearing activities 
as a result  a greater volume of the company s balances with correspondent banks have been uncollected funds  and therefore due from bank balances have been greater than similar size institutions in metropolitan areas where collection activity is more centralized 
however  if and when the federal reserve banks start accepting electronic items ie  imaged checks for collection  this geographic disadvantage will be removed 
premises and equipment premises and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
depreciation is charged to income over the estimated useful lives of the assets and leasehold improvements are amortized over the terms of the related lease  or the estimated useful lives of the improvements  whichever is shorter

the company s premises and equipment were of total assets at december   at the end of  and at the end of other assets other assets increased by million  or  during  rising to of total assets at december  from at the end of this increase is the result of a million commitment to invest in low income housing tax credit funds in may  and a million investment in bank owned life insurance boli in september and october of low income housing tax credit funds lower the company s tax liability through direct tax credits as well as partnership operating losses 
the company s investment in tax credit funds is the offset for partnership loss accruals  thus the total amount invested and committed for investment has been written down from its original million to million at december  even taking the losses into consideration and assuming no gain upon disposition  the estimated tax equivalent return on these investments over their year life is around 
boli is an insurance policy with a single premium paid at policy commencement

no assurance can be given that this return will be fully realized  though 
the company holds certain other equity investments that are not readily marketable securities and thus are classified as other assets on the company s balance sheet 
these include investments in pacific coast bankers bancshares  lender services acquisition corporation lsac  california economic development lending initiative  community bankers insurance agency  llc  and the federal home loan bank fhlb 
the largest of these investments is the company s million investment in fhlb stock 
this investment fluctuates from time to time based on the company s current and recent borrowing activity at the federal home loan bank 
the only other significant investment in this category is the company s million investment in lsac that was made during lsac is owned primarily by a consortium of california bank holding companies  none of which holds voting shares in excess of of the total voting stock of lsac 
lsac is a holding company for certain title insurance companies which operate mainly in california and which derive a portion of their revenues out of referrals from the banks that own lsac 
deposits information concerning the average balance and average rates paid on deposits by deposit type for the past three fiscal years is contained in the distribution  rate  and yield table located in the previous section on results of operations net interest income and net interest margin 
the composition and cost of the company s deposit base are important components in analyzing the company s net interest margin and balance sheet liquidity characteristics  both of which are discussed in greater detail in other sections herein 
net interest margin is improved to the extent that growth in deposits can be concentrated in historically lower cost deposits such as non interest bearing demand  now accounts  savings accounts and money market deposit accounts 
the company s liquidity is impacted by the volatility of deposits or other funding instruments  or in other words by the propensity of that money to leave the institution for rate related or other reasons 
potentially  the most volatile deposits in a financial institution are jumbo certificates of deposits  meaning time deposits with balances exceeding  as customers with balances of this magnitude are typically more rate sensitive than customers with smaller balances 
the company s community oriented deposit gathering activities in the central san joaquin valley  however  seem to have engendered a base of customers who tend to display more brand loyalty and thus are less likely to leave the company than might be expected 
the company s total deposit balances grew by million  or  during  while deposits actually fell by million during the prior year 
the decline in occurred because much of the funding for the significant growth in loans at the end of came in the form of non deposit borrowings from the federal home loan bank 
as previously discussed  federal home loan bank borrowings were replaced by brokered cd s early in  which provided approximately million of the increase in deposit balances from the end of to the end of jumbo cd s obtained through the branch system  however  appear to have fallen by about million  since total time deposits over  only increased by million 
furthermore  time certificates of deposits under  declined by million  or  during as was the case in many financial institutions across the country in  customers appeared to value liquidity over yield as balances shifted from time deposits into lower yielding money market and savings accounts  as well as interest free demand deposit accounts 
we are now focused on sustaining the momentum in core customer deposit growth in order to let brokered deposits roll off as they mature  although no assurance can be given that the company will achieve this objective 
not only was money shifted from jumbo cd s  but it also appears that the possibility of further principal losses in equity markets may have caused a general influx of money into relatively safe deposit products 
core deposits  comprised of all deposits except time deposits over  increased by an aggregate million in money market account balances  which increased by  in  represented million of that increase 
money market deposits also increased by nearly million  or  in due in large part to a promotional campaign run in the early months of that year 
money market accounts comprised of total deposits and short term borrowings at the end of  versus at the end of because of the drop 
table of contents in interest rates in  this movement into variable rate money market deposits has had a positive impact on the company s net interest margin 
balances which might have otherwise been locked in time deposits at higher rates were instead in money market instruments which were re priced downward frequently during the course of  and stayed down as rates have stabilized 
another favorable volume variance came in non interest demand deposits  which increased from of total deposits plus interest bearing liabilities at december  to at the end of december these deposits increased by million  or  in  and by million  or in likewise  interest bearing demand deposits  or now accounts  increased by million  or  in and by million  or  in regular savings accounts also increased by million  or  in the scheduled maturity distribution of the company s time deposits as of december  was as follows deposit maturity distribution dollars in thousands as of december  three months or less three to six months six to twelve months one to three years over three years total time certificates of deposits  other time deposits  total in addition to the deposit liabilities available in the local market  the company provides a cash management product to its commercial business customers 
this product group is categorized as a non deposit sweep account  and at december   the company s financial statements reflected million in repurchase agreements  which represent such sweep accounts see other borrowings section which follows 
at december   the company s financial statements reflected approximately million in repurchase agreements  secured by pledged investments held segregated from the company s own securities portfolio 
the decrease was mainly the result of certain relatively large customers converting sweep balances into higher yielding money market accounts 
as a result of their overnight investment aspect  the cost of these sweep accounts has generally been lower than the company s interest expense for longer term funds 
it is anticipated that while this product will remain an important aspect of the company s service capacity 
other borrowings the company utilizes other short term borrowing to temporarily fund loan growth when customer deposit growth has not kept pace with growth in outstanding loan balances 
in addition  short term borrowings may be used to purchase additional investments  or when additional liquidity is required to support higher customer cash utilization levels as was the case at december  due to yk considerations 
short term borrowings principally include overnight fed funds purchased  including advances from the federal home loan bank of san francisco fhlb  and securities sold under repurchase agreements which were described more fully in the previous section 
the details of these borrowings for the years   and are presented below 
table of contents short term borrowings repurchase agreements dollars in thousands balance at december average amount outstanding maximum amount outstanding at any month end average interest rate for the year fed funds purchased and overnight fhlb advances dollars in thousands balance at december average amount outstanding maximum amount outstanding at any month end average interest rate for the year the balance of fed funds purchased at the end of consisted exclusively of overnight advances from the federal home loan bank 
as explained previously  though  these fhlb borrowings were entirely replaced by brokered deposits in early our reliance on overnight fed funds subsequently increased to million at the end of  however  since that source was used to fund the increase in non earning cash items in process of collection at december  capital resources at december   the company had total shareholders equity of million  comprised of million in common stock  million in retained earnings  and million in accumulated other comprehensive income 
total shareholders equity at the end of was million 
net income has provided million in capital over the last three years  of which million or approximately was distributed in dividends 
the retention of earnings has been the company s main source of capital since the company did  however  issue million in trust preferred securities in  the proceeds of which are considered to be tier capital for regulatory purposes but long term debt in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the company paid cash dividends totaling million or per share in and million or per share in  representing and  respectively of the prior year s earnings 
as the holding company reorganization became effective on august   all of the dividends paid prior to that date were paid by the bank  rather than the company 
since  the bank or the company  as applicable has generally adhered to a policy of paying quarterly cash dividends totaling around of the prior year s net earnings to the extent consistent with general considerations of safety and soundness  provided that such payments do not adversely affect the bank s or the company s financial condition and are not overly restrictive to its growth capacity 
however  the bank experienced significant growth in  due mainly to its acquisition of sierra national bank in may of that year  and also had a slight contraction in earnings in the calendar year 
in light of these events  the board of directors declared dividends in totaling only approximately of the prior year earnings 
the company anticipates paying dividends in the future consistent with the general 
table of contents dividend policy as described above 
however  no assurance can be given that the bank s and the company s future earnings and or growth expectations in any given year will justify the payment of such a dividend 
the company uses a variety of measures to evaluate capital adequacy 
management reviews various capital measurements on a monthly basis and takes appropriate action to ensure that such measurements are within established internal and external guidelines 
the external guidelines  which are issued by the federal reserve board and the fdic  establish a risk adjusted ratio relating capital to different categories of assets and off balance sheet exposures 
there are two categories of capital under the federal reserve board and fdic guidelines tier and tier capital 
tier capital includes common shareholders equity and the proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities trust preferred securities are counted only up to a maximum of of tier capital  less goodwill and certain other deductions  notably the unrealized net gains or losses after tax adjustments on securities available for sale  which are carried at fair market value 
tier capital includes preferred stock and certain types of debt equity which the company does not hold  as well as the allowance for loan losses  subject to certain limitations

it is anticipated that the current level of capital will allow the bank to grow substantially and remain well capitalized  although no assurance can be given that this will be the case 
liquidity and market risk management the company must address on a daily basis the various and sundry factors which impact its continuing operations 
three of these factors have been previously discussed the economic climate which encompasses our business environment  the regulatory framework that governs our practices and procedures  and credit risk 
this section will address liquidity risk and market risk  two additional risks specific to the operation of a financial institution that also require active management 
liquidity liquidity refers to the company s ability to maintain a cash flow sufficient to fund operations and to meet obligations and other commitments in a timely and cost effective fashion 
at various times the company requires funds to meet short term cash requirements brought about by loan growth or deposit outflows  the purchase of assets  or liability repayments 
to manage liquidity needs properly  cash inflows must be timed to coincide with anticipated outflows  or sufficient liquidity resources must be available to meet varying demands 
the company manages liquidity in such a fashion as to be able to meet unexpected sudden changes in levels of its assets or deposit liabilities  without maintaining excessive amounts of on balance sheet liquidity 
excess balance sheet liquidity can negatively impact the interest margin 
an integral part of the company s ability to manage its liquidity position appropriately is the company s large base of core deposits  which were generated by offering traditional banking services in the communities in its service area and which have  historically  been a very stable source of funds 
the company s loan to deposit ratio jumped from at the end of to at the end of  primarily due to the surge in loan growth toward the end of which was funded with overnight borrowings from other banks 
the ratio 
table of contents declined in subsequent to the replacement of overnight borrowings with deposits  and was at december  the company also has the ability to raise deposits through various deposit brokers if required for liquidity purposes 
the unpledged portion of the company s investment portfolio is also an integral component of liquidity management due to the relative ease with which many bonds can be sold 
despite the significant decline in investment balances over the past two years there were still million in unpledged investments at the end of that could be sold  if necessary 
management is of the opinion that its investments and the other standby funding sources it has arranged are more than sufficient to meet the company s current and anticipated short term liquidity needs 
those additional sources include the following a formal borrowing line with the federal home loan bank that is secured by certain of the company s real estate loans  informal short term liquidity lines for overnight fed funds with certain correspondent banks  readily marketable loans  including the guaranteed portion of sba loans  and the net cash surrender value of boli 
interest rate risk management market risk arises from changes in interest rates  exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
the company s market risk exposure is primarily that of interest rate risk  and it has risk management policies to monitor and limit earnings and balance sheet exposure to changes in interest rates 
the company does not engage in the trading of financial instruments 
the principal objective of interest rate risk management often referred to as asset liability management is to manage the financial components of the company in a manner that will optimize the risk reward equation for earnings and capital in relation to changing interest rates 
in order to identify areas of potential exposure to rate changes  the company performs an earnings simulation analysis and a market value of portfolio equity calculation on a quarterly basis to identify more dynamic interest rate risk exposures than those apparent in a standard re pricing gap analysis 
the bancware modeling software is used by the company for asset liability management in order to simulate the effects of potential interest rate changes on the company s net interest margin 
these simulations can also provide both static and dynamic information on the projected fair market values of the company s financial instruments under different interest rate scenarios 
the simulation program utilizes specific individual loan and deposit maturities  embedded options  rates and re pricing characteristics to determine the effects of a given interest rate change on the company s interest income and interest expense 
rate scenarios consisting of key rate and yield curve projections are run against the company s investment  loan  deposit and borrowed funds portfolios 
these rate projections can be shocked an immediate and sustained change in rates  up or down  ramped an incremental increase or decrease in rates over a specified time period  economic based on current trends and econometric models or stable unchanged from current actual levels 
the company typically uses seven standard interest rate scenarios in conducting its simulations  namely stable  upward shocks of  and basis points  and downward shocks of   and basis points 
the company s policy is to limit the change in the company s net interest income for the next months to plus or minus based on a basis point bp shock  plus or minus based on a bp shock  and plus or minus based on a bp shock in interest rates 
as of december   the company had the following estimated net interest income sensitivity profile immediate change in rate bp bp bp bp bp bp change in net int inc change 
table of contents the above profile illustrates that if there were an immediate downward adjustment of basis points in interest rates and the company did nothing further with regard to the active management of its assets or liabilities  net interest income would likely decrease by around million  or approximately  over the next twelve months 
by the same token  if there were an immediate increase of basis points in interest rates  the company s net interest income would likely gain approximately  million  or  over the next year 
the company is asset sensitive  and the relationship between the change in net interest income under rising and declining rate scenarios is typically expected to be inversely proportionate 
in fact the company has  in the past  seen erosion in its interest margin when rates decline most recently in while benefiting in a rising rate environment 
the exposure to declining rates appears disproportionate in these simulations  however  because most of the company s deposit rates are currently so close to a floor of zero 
as rates on interest bearing liabilities hit this floor the company s yields on earning assets continue to fall  creating significant compression in the company s net interest margin 
in reality  while management does not expect current historically low rates to fall  if they did the company would likely limit movement in the bank of the sierra prime rate  although no assurance can be given that this would  indeed occur 
approximately million in variable rate loan balances are tied to that rate 
if the bank of the sierra prime rate is not lowered further from its current level  the company s interest rate risk profile changes dramatically immediate change in rate bp bp bp bp bp bp change in net int inc change the economic values of the company s loan and deposit portfolios also change under the interest rate scenarios previously discussed 
the amount of change is based on the characteristics of each loan and deposit class  which include the rate level relative to current market  the likelihood of prepayment  whether the rate is fixed or floating  the maturity of the instrument and the particular circumstances of the customer 
the quantification of the change in economic value is somewhat apparent in note  fair value of financial instruments  in the consolidated financial report  however such values change over time based on certain assumptions about interest rates and likely changes in the yield curve
