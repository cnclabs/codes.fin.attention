overview we are a biopharmaceutical company focused on the development  manufacture and marketing of monoclonal antibody based products for the detection and treatment of cancer and other serious diseases 
our most advanced therapeutic product candidate  epratuzumab  is a compound that binds to the malignant cells that comprise non hodgkin s b cell lymphoma and certain other lymphocytic leukemias 
in december  we granted a license to amgen to further develop and commercialize the unlabeled form of epratuzumab in north america and australia 
amgen is currently evaluating this compound in clinical trials for the treatment of patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma 
we currently maintain all other rights to epratuzumab outside of the territories granted to amgen  as well as all rights to the labeled versions of the compound worldwide 
accordingly  we are conducting clinical trials of the unlabeled and radiolabeled versions of the compound  epratuzumab and epratuzumab y  as well as clinically developing four other therapeutic product candidates 
we intend to consider licensing some or all of the rights we possess in epratuzumab as well as our other product candidates in the future if the right opportunities arise 
in addition to our therapeutic discoveries  our proprietary technologies have also enabled us to develop highly specific diagnostic imaging agents  one of which  cea scan  has already been approved in the united states and the european union  and is being marketed for the detection of colorectal cancers 
our second diagnostic product  leukoscan has been approved in europe and australia and is being marketed for the detection of bone infections 
these are the only products that we are currently licensed to market and sell and to date  we have received only limited revenues from the sale of these products 
we are also developing new cancer therapeutic antibody technology involving the selective delivery of therapeutic agents through pre targeting  in collaboration with our majority owned subsidiary  ibc pharmaceuticals  inc from inception in until june   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million and have never earned a profit 
in the absence of increased revenues from the sale of current or future products and licensing activities the amount  timing  nature  or source of which cannot be predicted  our losses will continue as we continue to conduct our research and development activities 
these activities are budgeted to expand over time and will require further resources if we are to be successful 
as a result  our operating losses are likely to be substantial over the next several years 
the development and commercialization of successful diagnostic and therapeutic products is subject to numerous risks and uncertainties including  without limitation  the following the type of therapeutic or diagnostic compound under investigation and nature of the disease in connection with which the compound is being studied  our ability  as well as the ability of our partners  to conduct and complete clinical trials on a timely basis  the time required for us to comply with all applicable federal  state and foreign legal requirements  including  without limitation  our receipt of the necessary approvals of the us food and drug administration  the financial resources available to us during any particular period  and many other factors associated with the commercial development of therapeutic and diagnostic products outside of our control 
research and development as of june   we employed professionals in our research and development departments 
in addition to salaries and benefits  the other costs associated with research and development include the costs associated with producing biopharmaceutical compounds  laboratory equipment and supplies  the costs of conducting clinical trials  legal fees and expenses associated with pursuing patent protection  as well as facilities costs 
we spent million in the aggregate for the fiscal year ended june  on research and development operating expenses 
in order to further support our research and development efforts  as well as prepare for future commercialization of our product candidates  we have recently completed a major expansion of our manufacturing facilities at a total cost of approximately million 
see liquidity and capital resources below 
we believe that our facilities  as expanded  will be adequate to support our research and development activities for the next two years without the need for any material capital expenditures 
at any one time our scientists are engaged in the research and development of multiple diagnostic and therapeutic compounds 
because we do not track expenses on the basis of each individual compound under investigation  but rather aggregate research and development costs for accounting purposes  it is not possible for investors to analyze and compare the expenses associated with unsuccessful research and development efforts for any particular fiscal period  with those associated with compounds that are determined to be worthy of further development 
this may make it more difficult for investors to evaluate our business and future prospects 
therapeutics substantially all of our research and development efforts involve the use of monoclonal antibodies to treat cancer and other serious diseases in one of two ways 
in the first  the antibodies are unlabeled  or naked  and used to treat the disease directly 
in the second  the antibodies are labeled  or conjugated  with radioisotopes  chemotherapeutic agents  toxins or other substances 
in each case the antibodies first seek out  and then bind to a particular target on diseased cells or on cells involved in a disease process 
epratuzumab the most advanced of our therapeutic compounds under development  epratuzumab immu  is a non radioactive antibody that targets the cd receptor of b cells and b cell lymphomas 
in  amgen purchased a license to epratuzumab covering the compound s further development and commercialization in north america and australia 
the license  for which amgen paid us million in cash and agreed to make additional milestone and royalty payments upon the achievement of certain future events  resulted in the transfer of responsibility to amgen for the clinical trials then being administered and paid for by us 
amgen is now responsible for all clinical trials that may be necessary to obtain regulatory approvals from the us food and drug administration and other authorities within amgen s licensed territory 
while the clinical results to date have been encouraging  we are not able to determine when  if ever  epratuzumab will be approved for sale in the united states or anywhere else 
even if it is approved  there can be no assurance that it will be commercially successful or that we will ever receive any future milestone or royalty payments 
other therapeutic product candidates at the time the amgen license was granted  we retained all other rights to the compound  including the development rights to the unlabeled version of the compound outside of amgen s licensed territory  as well as the rights to the different labeled versions of the compound in the united states and everywhere else 
we are evaluating both the labeled and unlabeled versions of the compound in clinical trials at the present time 
clinical trials are also being conducted with humanized antibody to carcinoembryonic antigen  or cea  in patients with colorectal  pancreatic or breast cancers  and clinical trials are beginning with a humanized antibody to alpha fetoprotein  or afp  in patients with primary liver cancer 
clinical trials are also commencing with our humanized antibody to cd in patients with non hodgkin s lymphoma and autoimmune disease 
in addition  we have four other therapeutic product candidates in pre clinical development 
all of these product candidates remain at a very early stage of development and we do not anticipate seeking regulatory approval with respect to any particular candidate for at least the next two years 
diagnostics in  we began to transition our focus away from the development of diagnostic imaging products in order to accelerate the development of our therapeutic product candidates 
as a result  as of june   research and development into diagnostic product candidates was no longer a material portion of our business 
ibc pharmaceuticals  inc in we began conducting research involving the selective delivery of therapeutic agents to fight cancer as part of a collaboration with beckman coulter 
upon our formation of the joint venture  ibc pharmaceuticals  llc  we granted certain intellectual property to the venture  as did beckman coulter 
we were then reimbursed for all of the research activities we conducted on the joint venture s behalf 
for the fiscal years june   and  we received reimbursements of   and  respectively  from ibc with respect to these research activities 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal year we were able to acquire all of the membership interests in the joint venture held by beckman coulter  giving us majority control of the business 
ibc pharmaceuticals  llc  was then reorganized into ibc pharmaceuticals  inc  a delaware corporation 
we currently hold all of the outstanding shares of ibc series a preferred stock  representing approximately of the total shares of voting stock outstanding 
the transaction was accounted for as a step acquisition and we recorded an in process research and development charge of  as discussed below 
at june  ibc pharmaceuticals  inc  had cash and cash equivalents of million 
as a result of our majority interest in ibc pharmaceuticals  inc operating results of ibc are consolidated 
critical accounting policies immunomedics s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following discussion highlights what we believe to be the critical accounting policies and judgments made in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition contract revenue from collaborative research agreements is recorded when earned based on the performance requirements of the contract 
revenue from non refundable upfront license fees and certain guaranteed payments where we continue involvement through collaborative development are deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continuing involvement 
we estimate the period of continuing involvement based on the best available evidential matter available to us at each reporting period 
if our estimated time frame for continuing involvement changes  this change in estimate could impact the amount of revenue recognized in future periods 
revenue from product sales is recorded when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable and collectability is reasonably assured 
allowances  if any  are established for uncollectible amounts  estimated product returns and discounts 
since allowances are recorded based on management s estimates  actual amounts may be different in the future 
foreign currency risks since immunomedics operates in countries outside of the united states  it is exposed to various foreign currency risks 
two specific risks arise from the nature of the contracts immunomedics executes with its customers since from time to time contracts are denominated in a currency different than the particular immunomedics subsidiary s local currency 
these risks are generally applicable only to a portion of the contracts executed by immunomedics s foreign subsidiaries providing clinical services 
the first risk occurs as revenue recognized for services rendered is denominated in a currency different from the currency in which the subsidiary s expenses are incurred 
as a result  the subsidiary s net revenues and resultant earnings can be affected by fluctuations in exchange rates 
historically  fluctuations in exchange rates from those in effect at the time contracts were executed have not had a material effect upon immunomedics s consolidated financial results 
the second risk results from the passage of time between the invoicing of customers and affiliates under these contracts and the ultimate collection of customer payments against such invoices 
because the contract is denominated in a currency other than the subsidiary s local currency  immunomedics recognizes a receivable at the time of invoicing for the local currency equivalent of the foreign currency invoice amount 
changes in exchange rates from the time the invoice is prepared and payment from the customer is received will result in immunomedics receiving either more or less in local currency than the local currency equivalent of the invoice amount at the time the invoice was prepared and the receivable established 
this difference is recognized by immunomedics as a foreign currency transaction gain or loss  as applicable  and is reported in other expense income in immunomedics s consolidated statements of operations 
finally  immunomedics s consolidated financial statements are denominated in us dollars 
accordingly  changes in exchange rates between the applicable foreign currency and the us dollar will affect the translation of each foreign subsidiary s financial results into us dollars for purposes of reporting immunomedics s consolidated financial results 
the process by which each foreign subsidiary s financial results are translated into us dollars is as follows income statement accounts are translated at average exchange rates for the period  balance sheet asset and liability accounts are translated at end of period exchange rates  and equity accounts are translated at historical exchange rates 
translation of the balance sheet in this manner affects the stockholders equity account  referred to as the cumulative translation adjustment account 
this account exists only in the foreign subsidiary s us dollar balance sheet and is necessary to keep the foreign balance sheet stated in us dollars in balance 
to date such cumulative translation adjustments have not been material to immunomedics s consolidated financial position 
stock based compensation immunomedics grants stock options to its employees at an exercise price equal to the fair value of the shares at the date of grant and accounts for these stock option grants in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees and related interpretations 
under apb opinion no 
 when stock options are issued with an exercise price equal to the market price of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized in the income statement 
however  for purposes of disclosure only  we estimate the fair value of stock options through the use of option pricing models 
in determining the values to use in our option pricing model  we make several subjective estimates about the characteristics of the underlying stock and the expected timing of option exercise 
changes to these estimates can change the fair value disclosures in our financial statements 
impairment of assets immunomedics reviews its long lived assets for impairment  when events or changes in circumstances occur that indicate that the carrying value of the asset may not be recoverable 
the assessment of possible impairment is based upon immunomedics s judgment of its ability to recover the asset from the expected future undiscounted cash flows of the related operations 
actual future cash flows may be greater or less than estimated 
results of operations fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  in the fiscal year ended june   representing a decrease of  or 
product sales for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing a decrease of  principally reflecting our transition in focus from the sale of diagnostic imaging products to the development of therapeutic compounds 
license fee and other revenues for fiscal year decreased to  from  for the same period in  primarily due to the recognition in of  as compared to  in fiscal of license fee revenue for a non exclusive license granted to daiichi pure chemicals co

revenues from grants for research and development for fiscal year decreased to  from  for the same period of total operating expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing an increase of  or 
research and development expenses for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  primarily due to an increased number of professional staff  as well as increased research and development efforts  manufacturing expenses including lab supplies associated with producing compounds to be used in clinical trials and costs associated with ibc pharmaceuticals in the amount of  as ibc became a majority owned subsidiary of immunomedics in june cost of goods sold for fiscal year decreased by  to  from  in fiscal year  primarily due to decreased sales of in vitro diagnostic kits and other imaging products 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  representing a decrease of  this is primarily due to lower staffing levels in the united states and europe and the reduction of other marketing related expenses consistent with our shift in focus to therapeutics 
general and administrative costs for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  this was primarily due to the recognition of compensation expense of  associated with the issuance of a fully vested option to acquire  shares of our common stock at a purchase price of per share to dr 
morton coleman  a non employee director  in consideration for consulting services to immunomedics  as well as an increased number of employees and associated salary expenses  increased insurance costs  increased regulatory compliance costs for all public companies and other administrative expenses 
interest and other income for fiscal year decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  in  primarily due to lower rates of return on our invested cash and reduced level of cash available for investment 
for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately  and  of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
the tax benefit is partially offset by an income tax provision of  for our european subsidiary 
net loss allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year is  or per share  as compared to  or per share  in fiscal year fiscal year compared to fiscal year revenues for the fiscal year ended june  were  as compared to  in the fiscal year ended june   representing an increase of  or 
product sales for fiscal year were  as compared to  in fiscal year  representing a decrease of  principally reflecting our transition in focus from the sale of diagnostic imaging products to the development of therapeutic compounds 
license fee and other revenues for fiscal year increased to  from  for the same period in  primarily due to the recognition in of  as compared to  in fiscal of the up front license payment received from amgen 
in addition  in fiscal we recognized  as license fee revenue for a non exclusive license granted to daiichi pure chemicals co

research and development expenses for fiscal year increased by  from  in fiscal year to  primarily due to an increased number of professional staff  as well as increased research and development efforts and associated manufacturing expenses  including lab supplies associated with producing compounds to be used in clinical trials 
cost of goods sold for fiscal year decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  primarily due to lower distribution costs and a reduced number of vials sold 
cost of goods sold in fiscal year included a charge of  as compared to  in fiscal relating to the expiration of certain cea scan inventories previously manufactured and capitalized 
sales and marketing expenses for fiscal year were  as compared to  for fiscal year  representing a decrease of  general and administrative costs for fiscal year decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  this was primarily due to the recognition of an expense of  in fiscal associated with warrants issued to a financial advisor  and an expense of  as a fee associated with our entering into the licensing and development agreement with amgen see note to our consolidated financial statements included elsewhere herein  partially offset by an increase of other administrative expenses in fiscal year as a result of our acquisition of majority control of ibc in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we recorded a charge related to acquired in process research and development of  which was immediately expensed 
at the date of acquisition  none of the products under development by ibc had achieved technological feasibility and none were being sold in the market 
interest and other income for fiscal year decreased by  from  in fiscal year to  in  primarily due to lower rates of return and a reduced level of cash available for investments 
for fiscal years and  we recorded a tax benefit of  and  respectively  as a result of our sale of approximately  and  of new jersey state net operating losses  respectively 
net loss allocable to common stockholders for fiscal year was  or per share  as compared to  or per share  in fiscal year liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  we have financed our operations primarily through private sales of our equity securities  revenue earned under licensing agreements and to a lesser degree  from sales of cea scan and leukoscan  research grants from various sources and investment income 
at june   we had working capital of  representing a decrease of  from  at june  at june   we had long term debt of  as a result of a low interest loan received through the new jersey economic development authority 
the net decrease in working capital resulted principally from the net loss allocable to common stockholders during fiscal year of  and capital expenditures of  in order to support our clinical trials and anticipated future commercial requirements  we have completed the expansion of our manufacturing facility at a cost of approximately million 
we funded this project by obtaining a loan through the new jersey economic development authority 
the expanded facility now includes two new manufacturing suites  containing six new bioreactors  which are intended to allow flexibility in terms of the amount of therapeutic compounds that can be produced 
see note to our consolidated financial statements 
our cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities amounted to  at june   representing a decrease of  from  at june  this decrease was primarily attributable to the funding of operating expenses and capital expenditures 
it is anticipated that working capital and cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities will decrease during fiscal year as a result of planned operating expenses and capital expenditures  offset in part by projected revenues from sales of our diagnostic imaging products in the united states and europe 
however  there can be no assurance  as to the amount of revenues  if any  these imaging products will provide 
to date  we have not generated positive cash flow from operations  excluding the effects of the up front payment received from amgen in fiscal year we believe that our existing working capital should be sufficient to meet our capital and liquidity requirements for the next twelve months 
actual results could differ materially from our expectations as a result of a number of risks and uncertainties  including the risks described in item  factors that may affect our business and results of operations and elsewhere in this annual report 
our working capital and working capital requirements are affected by numerous factors and such factors may have a negative impact on our liquidity 
principal among these are the success of product commercialization and marketing products  the technological advantages and pricing of our products  the impact of the regulatory requirements applicable to us and access to capital markets that can provide us with the resources when necessary to fund our strategic priorities 
we expect to utilize our cash equivalents and short term investments to fund our operations at levels similar to those used in fiscal year however  we do not believe that we will have adequate cash at this spending level to complete our research and development programs 
as a result  we will require additional financial resources after we utilize our current liquid assets in order for us to continue our research and development programs  clinical trials of our product candidates and regulatory filing 
additional financing may not be available to us on terms we find acceptable  if at all  and the terms of such financing may cause substantial dilution to existing stockholders 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to curtail significantly one or more of our research and development programs 
if we obtain funds through collaborative partnerships  we may be required to relinquish rights to certain or our technologies or product candidates 
we intend to supplement our financial resources from time to time as market conditions permit through additional debt or equity financings and through collaborative marketing and distribution agreements 
we continue to evaluate various programs to raise additional capital and to seek additional revenues from the licensing of our proprietary technologies 
at the present time  we are unable to determine whether any of these future activities will be successful and  if so  the terms and timing of any definitive agreements 
contractual commitments our major contractual obligations relate to an operating lease for our facility 
we have identified and quantified the significant commitments in the following table for the fiscal years ending june payments due by period in s contractual obligation thereafter total operating lease njeda loan in november  we renewed our operating lease for the morris plains facility for an additional term of twenty years expiring in october at a base annual rate of  which included an additional  square feet 
the rent is fixed for the first five years and increases every five years thereafter 
in may  we obtained a loan at a variable interest rate through the new jersey economic development authority repayable in months

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discussion about our exposure to market risk of financial instruments contains forward looking statements under the private securities litigation reform act of actual results may differ materially from those described due to a number of factors  including uncertainties associated with general economic conditions and conditions impacting our industry 
our holdings of financial instruments are comprised primarily of corporate debt securities and municipal bonds 
all such instruments are classified as securities available for sale with the exception of  classified as restricted securities on the balance sheet at june  although  shown in the table below  these municipal bonds collateralize a loan we received through the new jersey economic development authority  and therefore are not classified as available for sale 
we do not invest in portfolio equity securities or commodities or use financial derivatives for trading purposes 
our debt security portfolio represents funds held temporarily pending use in our business and operations 
we manage these funds accordingly 
we seek reasonable assuredness of the safety of principal and market liquidity by investing in rated fixed income securities while at the same time seeking to achieve a favorable rate or return 
our market risk exposure consists principally of exposure to changes in interest rates 
our holdings also are exposed to the risks of changes in the credit quality of issuers 
we typically invest in highly liquid debt instruments with fixed interest rates 
the table below presents the principal amounts and related weighted average interest rates by fiscal year of maturity for our investment portfolio as of june  total fair value in thousands fixed rate average interest rate
