the company does not have any amounts outstanding under the credit facility at december  a summary of our contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  are as follows amounts in thousands amounts due in obligation total obligation and thereafter capital lease obligations     operating leases     total obligations     we believe that our cash and equivalents  cash to be provided by operations and available credit under our credit facility will be sufficient to fund our current operating requirements and planned capital expenditures over the next months and for the foreseeable future 
we plan to focus on internal growth in the near term as the primary means of our expansion  although we may consider acquisition and investment opportunities as they arise  to the extent permissible 
cash provided by operations may not be sufficient to fund all internal growth initiatives that we may wish to pursue 
if we pursue significant internal growth initiatives or if we wish to acquire additional businesses in transactions that include cash payments as part of the purchase price  we may pursue additional debt or equity sources to finance such transactions and activities  depending on market conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be successful in raising the cash required to complete all acquisition  investment or business opportunities which we may wish to pursue in the future 
risks related to our business before deciding to invest in our company or to maintain or increase your investment  you should carefully consider the risk described below  in addition to the other information contained in this report and in our other filings with the sec  including our subsequent reports on forms q and k 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones facing our company 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial may also affect our business 
if any of these known or unknown risks or uncertainties actually occurs with material adverse effects on ventiv  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed 
in that event  the market price for our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of your investment 
our revenues are dependent on expenditures by companies in the life sciences industries  and a variety of factors could cause the overall levels of those expenditures to decline 
our revenues are highly dependent on promotional  marketing and sales expenditures by companies in the life sciences industries  particularly the pharmaceutical industry 
promotional  marketing and sales expenditures by pharmaceutical manufacturers have in the past been  and could in the future be  negatively impacted by  among other things  governmental reform or private market initiatives intended to reduce the cost of pharmaceutical products or by governmental  medical association or pharmaceutical industry initiatives designed to regulate the manner in which pharmaceutical manufacturers promote their products 
furthermore  the trend in the life sciences industries toward consolidation  by merger or otherwise  may result in a reduction in overall sales and marketing expenditures and  potentially  the use of contract sales and marketing services providers 
if the demand for outsourced marketing and sales services in the life sciences industries declines our business would be harmed 
our business and growth depend in large part on the demand from the pharmaceutical and life sciences industries for the outsourced marketing and sales services 
companies may elect to perform such services internally based on industry and company specific factors such as the rate of new product development and fda approval of those products  number of sales representatives employed internally in relation to demand for or the need to promote new and existing products  and competition from other suppliers 
the decision by the pharmaceutical or life sciences companies not to use  or to reduce the use of  outsourced marketing and sales services such as those that we provide would have a material adverse effect on our business 
many of the contracts under which we provide marketing and sales services are subject to termination on short notice  which may make our revenues less predictable 
ventiv has seen an increase in demand from clients for incentive based and revenue sharing arrangements 
under incentive based arrangements  ventiv is typically paid a fixed fee and  in addition  has an opportunity to increase its earnings based on the market performance of the products being detailed in relation to targeted sales volumes  sales force performance metrics or a combination thereof 
under revenue sharing arrangements  ventiv s compensation is based on the market performance of the products being detailed  usually expressed as a percentage of product sales 
these types of arrangements transfer some market risk from clients to the company 
in addition  these arrangements can result in variability in revenue and earnings due to seasonality of product usage  changes in market share  new product introductions  overall promotional efforts and other market related factors 
we provide services to many of our most significant clients under contracts that our clients may cancel  typically on to days notice 
in addition  many of these contracts provide our clients with the opportunity to internalize the sales forces sales force conversion under contract  with sufficient notice 
also  although the company has been successful in a number of cases in negotiating longer term commitments and a non cancelable initial period  the company cannot be assured that clients will renew relationships beyond the expiration date of existing contracts 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our most significant clients will continue to do business with us over the long term 
if any of our significant clients elect to cancel  convert or not renew their contracts  it could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may not be successful in managing our infrastructure and resources to support continued growth 
our ability to grow depends to a significant degree on our ability to successfully leverage our existing infrastructure to perform services for our clients  as well as on our ability to develop and successfully implement new marketing methods or channels for new services 
our growth will also depend on a number of other factors  including our ability to maintain the high quality of the services we provide to our customers and to increase our penetration with existing customers  to recruit  motivate and retain qualified personnel  and to economically train existing sales representatives and recruit new sales representatives 
we will also be required to implement operational and financial systems and additional management resources to operate efficiently and effectively regardless of market conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to manage or expand our operations effectively to address current demand and market conditions 
if we are unable to manage our infrastructure and resources effectively  this could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we employ computer technology to deliver our services  and any failure of or damage to this technology could impair our ability to conduct our business 
we have invested significantly in specialized computer technology and have focused on the application of this technology to provide customized solutions to meet many of our clients needs 
we have also invested significantly in end user databases and software that enable us to market our clients products to targeted markets 
we anticipate that it will be necessary to continue to select  invest in and develop new and enhanced technology and end user databases on a timely basis in the future in order to maintain our competitiveness 
in addition  our business is dependent on our computer equipment and software systems  and the temporary or permanent loss of this equipment or systems  through casualty or operating malfunction  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
our property and business interruption insurance may not adequately compensate us for all losses that we may incur in any such event 
we are subject to a high degree of government regulation 
significant changes in these regulations  or our failure to comply with them  could impose additional costs on us or otherwise negatively affect our operations 
in connection with the handling and distribution of samples of pharmaceutical products  we are subject to regulation by the prescription drug marketing act of and other applicable federal  state and local laws and regulations in the united states 
these laws regulate the distribution of drug samples by mandating storage  handling and record keeping requirements for drug samples and by banning the purchase or sale of drug samples 
in addition  certain ethical guidelines promulgated by the american medical association ama govern the receipt by physicians of gifts in connection with the marketing of healthcare products 
these guidelines govern the honoraria and other items of value  which ama physicians may receive  directly or indirectly  from pharmaceutical companies 
any changes in these regulations and guidelines or their application could have a material adverse effect on our business 
failure to comply with these requirements could result in the imposition of fines  loss of licenses and other penalties and could have a material adverse effect on ventiv 
pharmaceutical manufacturers and the healthcare industry  in general  are subject to significant us federal and state regulation 
in particular  regulations affecting the pricing or marketing of pharmaceuticals could make it uneconomical or infeasible for pharmaceutical companies to market their products through medical marketing detailers 
other changes in the domestic and international regulation of the pharmaceutical industry could also have a material adverse effect on ventiv 
our services are subject to evolving industry standards and rapid technological changes 
the markets for our services are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and frequent introduction of new and enhanced services 
to succeed  we must continue to enhance our existing services  introduce new services on a timely and cost effective basis to meet evolving customer requirements  integrate new services with existing services  achieve market acceptance for new services  and respond to emerging industry standards and other technological changes 
we may be adversely affected by customer concentration 
we have three customers that each accounted for more than of of our net revenues for the year ended december   and our largest customer during such year accounted for of net revenues 
if any large customer decreases or terminates its relationship with us  our business  results of operations or financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition revenues are recognized on product detailing contracts as services are performed 
most of the company s contracts involve two phases  a deployment phase  typically three months  in which the company performs initial recruiting  training and preparation for deployment of the field force at the start of a new contract  and the promotion phase in which the company s deployed field force actively promotes specified products for clients detailing 
the company recognizes revenue during the promotion phase of its contracts on a straight line basis based on the size of the deployed field force 
the promotion phase continues for the remaining life of the contract 
many of the product detailing contracts allow for additional periodic incentive fees to be earned by the company once agreed upon performance benchmarks have been attained 
revenue earned from incentive fees is recognized when the company is reasonably assured that payment will be made  and is typically based upon verification through calculation of achievement  third party data or client verification 
many contracts also stipulate penalties if agreed upon performance benchmarks have not been met 
these penalties are recognized upon verification of performance shortfalls 
a number of the company s smaller detailing contracts for products promoted by the company s standing specialty sales teams are revenue sharing based arrangements whereby the company receives a portion of the revenue from products it promotes 
revenue from these contracts is recognized when agreed upon performance benchmarks have been attained and payment is reasonably assured 
the company periodically analyzes its detailing contracts to determine the likelihood and amount of any potential loss on a contract resulting from lower than anticipated product or field force performance 
in the event that current information illustrates a loss is likely to be incurred over the remaining life of the contract  the company accrues that loss at the time it becomes probable 
most of the company s contracts specify a separate fee for the initial deployment phase of a project 
the company considers the deployment phase to be a separate and distinct earnings process and recognizes the related revenues throughout the deployment phase 
non refundable conversion fees are paid and recognized as revenue when one of the company s sales professionals accepts a firm offer of permanent employment from a customer during the term of a contract 
reimbursable costs including those relating to travel and out of pocket expenses  sales force bonuses tied to product revenues  and other similar costs  are included in revenues  and an equivalent amount of reimbursable expenses is included in costs of services 
revenues for the company s hpr planning and analytics business generally include fixed fees  which are recognized when monthly services are performed on a straight line basis and payment is reasonably assured 
hpr s initial contracts typically range from one month to one year 
revenues for additional services are recognized when the services are provided and payment is reasonably assured 
customers are invoiced according to agreed upon billing terms 
contracts that are invoiced prior to performance of related services are recorded as deferred revenue and are not recognized as revenues until earned  in accordance with the company s revenue recognition policies 
amounts earned for revenues recognized before the agreed upon billing terms have been met are recorded as revenue and included in unbilled accounts receivable on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
upon billing  these amounts are transferred to billed accounts receivable 
contracts are typically either terminable upon days written notice by client  or non cancelable for a one year term 
most contracts are immediately terminable by the client for default by the company 
normally  if a client terminates a project  the client remains obligated to pay for services performed and reimbursable expenses incurred through the date of termination
