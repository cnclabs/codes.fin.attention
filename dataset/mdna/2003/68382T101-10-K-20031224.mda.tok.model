item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and the related notes to such financial statements included elsewhere in this report beginning on page f the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
the statements are based on current expectations and actual results could differ materially from those discussed herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to the differences are discussed in business risk factors and elsewhere in this report 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note to the our financial statements describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory write downs  and accrued expenses 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
o the allowance for doubtful accounts is based on our assessment of the collectibility of specific customer accounts and the aging of the accounts receivable 
if there is a deterioration of a major customer s credit worthiness or actual defaults are higher than our historical experience  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be adversely affected 
o inventory purchases and commitments are based upon future demand forecasts 
if there is a sudden or significant decrease in demand for our products or there is a higher risk of inventory obsolescence because of rapidly changing technology and customer requirements  we may be required to write down our inventory and our gross margin could be adversely affected 
o we use estimates in the determination of the required accrual for warranty costs 
this estimate is based upon a detailed examination of past experience and current information 
the information available to us may change in the future and may require us to revise this accrual 
o we have evaluated the available evidence about future taxable income and other possible sources of realization of deferred tax assets 
we have established a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to an amount that represents management s best estimate of the amount of such deferred tax assets that more likely than not will be realized 
o we continually reassess our assumptions and judgments and make adjustments when significant facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not been materially different than the estimates that are described above 
overview we design  manufacture and sell a comprehensive line of high performance  highly reliable fiber optic subsystems and modules for fiber optic transmission systems that are used to address the bandwidth limitations in metropolitan area networks  or mans  local area networks  or lans  and storage area networks  or sans  markets 
our subsystems and modules include optical transmitters  receivers  transceivers and transponders that convert electronic signals into optical signals and back to electronic signals  enabling high speed communication of voice and data traffic over public and private networks 
we began our operations and shipped our first products in november of furukawa beneficially owns all of our outstanding class b common stock  representing of our outstanding shares of common stock and of the combined voting power of all of our outstanding common stock as of the fiscal year ended september  since our inception  we have purchased substantially all of our lasers and the majority of our other fiber optic components from furukawa 
we have relied on furukawa s research and development capabilities to provide us with technologically advanced lasers and fiber optic components that we purchase from furukawa for inclusion in our products 
we currently purchase the majority of lasers from furukawa under a master purchase agreement which we entered into with furukawa on october  we operate in one industry segment  the design and manufacture of fiber optic subsystems and modules 
we sell our products to original equipment manufacturers or oems  their contract manufacturers or cms  who incorporate them into systems they assemble for oems and to distributors 
we define our customers as oems who have purchased our products directly or indirectly through cms and distributors 
we recognize revenue upon product shipment  and sales returns and allowances have been insignificant 
historically  a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant percentage of our revenue 
our largest customers accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
cisco systems  alcatel  and huawei including sales to each of their contract manufacturers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  cisco systems  alcatel  and nortel networks including sales to each of their contract manufacturers accounted for approximately  and  respectively  of our total revenue for the fiscal year ended september  no other customer accounted for more than of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september  and for financial reporting purposes  we consider our customers to be the oems  cms and distributors who place purchase orders with us directly 
for the fiscal year ended september   comstar communications accounted for of our total revenue 
no other direct sales customer accounted for more than of our total revenue for the fiscal years ended september  and although our revenue from sales to our other customers continues to increase  we expect that significant customer concentration will continue for the foreseeable future 
our sales are made on a purchase order basis rather than by long term purchase commitments 
our customers may cancel or defer purchase orders without penalty on short notice 
in october  methode electronics  inc filed a lawsuit against infineon technologies corporation and us seeking unspecified damages  including monetary damages  injunctive relief  attorneys fees and costs arising from our alleged infringement of some of the claims contained in patents assigned to methode  including patents relating to our x pin configuration products 
after methode initiated the lawsuit  it assigned to stratos lightwave  inc  a methode spin off  all of methode s rights  title and interest in the patent at issue 
the court subsequently added stratos as a plaintiff to the lawsuit 
on april   we resolved our patent infringement litigation with stratos 
the settlement resolves all claims in the lawsuit among us and stratos 
as part of the settlement  we entered into a five year license agreement with stratos covering stratos portfolio of optoelectronic transceiver patents 
in consideration of the license agreement  we are required to pay a total of million over the license term 
our optoelectronic products covered by this license include our x  gbic  small form factor sff and small form factor pluggable sfp product families 
at the end of the five year term  we have the option to renegotiate with stratos for an extension of the license 
since early  the telecommunications sector  and in particular the fiber optic networking sector  has suffered a severe downturn 
system providers have scaled back on deployment and have dramatically reduced their purchases of systems from equipment manufacturers 
as a result  equipment manufacturers have also reduced purchases of components and modules from our competitors and from us 
the slowdown continues to have a negative impact on our business and our revenue as a result of our customers declining business 
on october   we acquired certain assets of cielo communications  inc  cielo communications a research and design company located in broomfield  colorado  focused on creating vcsel technology for fiber optic communication networks for a cash purchase price and direct costs of million 
the purchase price includes the acquisition of capital equipment and intellectual property 
on january   we acquired parallel optical module assets and intellectual property from gore photonics  an industry leader in the research and development of vcsel parallel optical modules for fiber optic communication networks located in elkton  maryland  for a cash purchase price of million 
the purchase price includes the acquisition of capital equipment and inventory 
the average selling prices of our products generally decrease as the products mature from factors such as increased competition  the introduction of new products  increased unit volumes  and price concessions required by our customers 
we anticipate that average selling prices of our existing products will continue to decline in future periods although the timing and degree of the declines cannot be predicted with any certainty 
we must continue to develop and introduce new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices on a timely basis 
our cost of revenue consists principally of materials  as well as salaries and related expenses for manufacturing personnel  manufacturing overhead and provisions for excess and obsolete inventory 
we purchase several key components for our products from a limited number of suppliers 
our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for design engineers and other technical personnel  cost of developing prototypes  and depreciation of test and prototyping equipment 
our research and development expenses also consist of materials and overhead costs related to major product development projects 
we charge all research and development expenses to operations as incurred 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to our future success 
accordingly  we may continue to expand our internal research and development capabilities in the future to develop new products 
as a result  we expect that our research and development expenses in absolute dollar amounts will increase in future periods 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales and marketing personnel  commissions paid to sales personnel and independent manufacturers representatives  marketing and promotion costs 
we intend to expand our sales and marketing operations and efforts in order to increase sales and market awareness of our products 
in july we opened sales offices in bury st 
edmunds  england and richardson  texas  in may we opened a sales office in ottawa  canada  in may we opened a sales office in santa clara  california  and in march we opened a sales office in nashua  new hampshire 
we believe that investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success and expect these expenses to increase in the future 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries  stock compensation and related expenses for our administrative  finance and human resources personnel  professional fees and other corporate expenses 
we expect that general and administrative expenses will decrease in the near term primarily due to a decrease in stock compensation 
however  we believe that this decrease will be partially offset by an increase in our legal and consulting fees associated with analysis of strategic alternatives  including future market opportunities that have been undertaken by our management and board of directors 
as a result  our general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars may increase in future periods 
results of operations the following table sets forth income statement data for the periods indicated as a percentage of revenue fiscal years ended september  revenue cost of revenue gross profit operating expenses research and development sales and marketing general and administrative total operating expenses income loss from operations other income income loss before income taxes income taxes net income loss fiscal years ended september  and revenue revenue increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  sales of our products for metropolitan area networks were approximately of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  compared to approximately of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  sales of our products for local area and storage area networks were approximately of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  compared to approximately of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  in addition  the selling prices for our existing products may decline in response to new product introductions by our competitors or us  and pressure from our significant customers for price concessions 
also  in may  acterna  one of our significant customers  filed for chapter bankruptcy with respect to itself and its domestic subsidiaries 
we do not believe that acterna s bankruptcy filing will impact its operating subsidiaries in europe  latin america and the asia pacific region 
we have experienced lower revenue from acterna in the last six months of the fiscal year ended september  compared to the first six months of the fiscal year 
this was primarily offset by an increase in sales to other customers 
if acterna s bankruptcy filing causes it to continue to reduce its orders to us  it could negatively affect our revenue in future quarters 
cost of revenue cost of revenue decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  gross margin increased to in the fiscal year ended september  from in the same period last year 
the increase in gross margin was primarily due to a million increase of inventory used in production in the fiscal year ended september  that was previously written down as excess inventory compared to the fiscal year ended september   and a million decrease in inventory write downs in the fiscal year ended september  compared to the fiscal year ended september  these were partially offset by a  increase in material cost as a result of the increase in revenues  an increase in licensing fees as a result of the licensing agreement entered into with stratos lightwave  inc being included in cost of revenue in and higher warranty expense when compared to the prior year 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was due to an increase in salaries and other operating costs resulting from the increase of personnel and operation costs associated with the acquisitions of certain business assets of cielo communications and gore photonics and the addition of engineering personnel hired in woodland hills  california and bury st 
edmunds  england 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  the increase was primarily due to an increase of million in salaries and benefits from the addition of sales and marketing personnel hired and an increase of  in commissions paid to our direct sales force and independent manufacturers representatives 
this increase was partially offset by a decrease in licensing fees for the license agreement entered into with stratos lightwave  inc due to licensing fees being included in cost of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  during the third quarter of  the company repurchased stock from two executives 
the stock repurchased by the company had been recently acquired by the executives through the exercise of stock options 
the company has recorded a million expense associated with this stock repurchase as stock compensation expense 
in addition  the increase was due to an increase of  in insurance expense primarily related to an increase in directors and officers insurance premiums and an increase of  in salaries and benefits related to the addition of personnel hired 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in legal and consulting fees due to a decrease in legal fees associated with the stratos lightwave  inc patent infringement litigation and a decrease in consulting fees associated with the analysis of strategic alternatives 
other income  net other income  net decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this decrease was due to a decrease in investment income  which was primarily the result of a decrease in interest rates 
income taxes the income tax benefit was million for the fiscal year ended september   based on an effective tax rate of compared to a income tax benefit of  for the fiscal year ended september  the income tax benefit for the fiscal year ended september  includes a charge of million related to the valuation allowance of certain deferred tax assets and state net operating loss and credit carry forwards 
fiscal years ended september  and revenue revenue decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this decrease was primarily due to the generally weaker economy and continued downturn in the telecommunications sector since early  which has caused system providers to scale back on deployment of fiber optic networks and draw down on existing inventory levels 
this resulted in a decrease in demand from our customers and equipment manufacturers of their purchases of components and modules that we provide 
sales of our products for man decreased to approximately of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  from approximately of revenue for the fiscal year ended september  we expect our revenue to continue to be negatively affected by the economic downturn and its impact on the overall market growth in the foreseeable future 
in addition  the average selling prices for existing products may decline in response to product introductions by competitors or us  and pressure from our significant customers for price concessions 
cost of revenue cost of revenue decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in cost of revenue in absolute dollars was primarily due to the decrease in revenue and a million decrease in excess inventory write downs 
the decrease in excess inventory write downs was primarily due to a decrease in overall inventory levels and an increase in inventory write downs in the fiscal year ended september  as a result of the industry slowdown and its impact on the demand for our products 
gross margin decreased from during the fiscal year ended september  to during the fiscal year ended september  the decrease in gross margin was primarily due to an increase of in salaries and related expenses for indirect manufacturing personnel and in direct labor costs as a percentage of revenue  both of which decreased in absolute dollars 
the increases in salaries and related expenses for indirect manufacturing personnel as a percentage of revenue were due to a decrease in production and the increase in direct labor costs as a percentage of revenue was due to a decrease in labor efficiency 
these increases as a percentage of revenue were partially offset by decreases as a percentage of revenue of in the cost of materials  in excess inventory write downs and in the warranty provision 
the decrease in material cost as a percentage of revenue was due to inventory that was used in production that was previously written down by approximately million as excess 
the decrease in the warranty provision as a percentage of revenues was due to a decrease in customer returns allowance required as a result of the decrease in revenue 
research and development research and development expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was primarily due to an increase in salaries and other operating costs resulting from the hiring of additional engineering personnel 
research and development expenses as a percentage of revenue increased to from over this period because of decreased revenue 
we expect research and development expenses to increase significantly in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue as we continue to expand our research and development efforts 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease of million in commissions to independent manufacturers representatives partially offset by increases of  in salaries and employee benefits resulting from the hiring of additional sales and marketing personnel 
we believe that investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success and expect these expenses to increase in absolute dollars in the future as we expand our sales and marketing efforts 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses increased to million in the fiscal year ended september  from million in the fiscal year ended september  this increase was primarily due to a million increase in legal expenses and consulting fees related to our patent infringement litigation with stratos lightwave  inc and consulting services associated with an analysis of strategic alternatives  including future market opportunities  undertaken by our management and board of directors 
the increase was also due to a  increase in insurance expenses related to an increase in directors and officers insurance premiums 
these increases were substantially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense as a result of the decrease in revenue and the decrease in past due accounts 
we expect the dollar level of legal and consulting fees to increase as we continue to explore and evaluate strategic alternatives and expected increases in our directors and officers insurance premiums as a result of market changes for such insurance coverage 
income taxes the benefit for income taxes was  in the fiscal year ended september   compared to a provision for income taxes of million in the fiscal year ended september  the benefit for income taxes in the fiscal year ended september  was the result of tax benefits associated with our extra territorial elections

we believe that period to period comparisons of operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
some of the factors which could cause our operating results to vary include fluctuations in the demand for and sales of our products  the timing of customer orders  the cancellation of existing orders  competitive factors such as introductions of new products  our ability to develop  introduce and manufacture new products in a timely manner  our ability to control expenses  the availability of components for our products  the mix of our products sold  changes in industry standards and general economic conditions in the communications and related industries 
the following table sets forth revenue attributable to each of our product groups as a percentage of revenue for the periods presented 
fiscal years ended september  receivers transceivers transmitters other revenue liquidity and capital resources as of september   our primary source of liquidity was our cash and cash equivalents balance of million and million of marketable securities  which consist primarily of united states treasury notes and treasury bonds 
at september   we had million in cash and cash equivalents balance and million in marketable securities 
the total of our cash and cash equivalents balance and our marketable securities balance decreased during the fiscal year primarily due to the million cash purchase price and direct costs associated with the acquisition of certain assets of cielo communications  the million cash purchase price associated with the acquisition of certain assets of gore photonics  the million in property  plant and equipment purchases and the million of stock compensation paid in cash 
the purchase prices for cielo communications and gore photonics include the acquisition of inventory  capital equipment and intellectual property 
since inception  we have financed our operations primarily with cash generated from operations 
additional financing has been generated through term loans and through our initial public offering of our class a common stock  which we completed on november  as of september   our working capital was million with a current ratio of compared to our working capital of million with a current ratio of as of september  our working capital decreased during the fiscal year primarily due to the million cash purchase price and direct costs associated with the acquisition of certain assets of cielo communications and gore photonics in addition to the purchases of property  plant and equipment and the stock compensation paid in cash 
because of our low debt balances  we believe that additional cash could be borrowed if necessary  however  cash flow from operations  cash and cash equivalents  marketable securities  and existing loan facilities are expected to be sufficient to fund operations for the next months 
on march   we terminated our revolving credit facility with manufacturer s bank 
the credit limit of the revolving credit facility was million 
no amounts had been borrowed against the revolving credit facility through the termination date of the revolving credit facility in as of september   we had a million balance outstanding under our term loan 
the term loan bears interest on amounts outstanding at various time intervals and the market rates based on our election at a per annum rate equal to either a the prime rate or b libor plus 
the term loan matures in july  and the proceeds of the term loan were used to purchase our former primary corporate and manufacturing facility in chatsworth  california 
the term loan contains customary covenants  including covenants limiting indebtedness and the disposition of assets 
to secure our payment and performance obligations under the term loan we have pledged all of our assets as collateral 
the term loan also requires that we comply with financial covenants  which require us to maintain our tangible net worth  cash position and revenue at specified levels 
as of september   we were not in compliance with selected loan covenants  however the company has obtained a waiver from the financial institution 
our need to comply with these covenants does not materially affect the operation of our business 
during the fiscal year ended september   we used net cash in operations of  the cash used in operating activities during this period was due to the net loss  which included the million of stock compensation paid in cash and increases in accounts receivables and income taxes receivable 
these were partially offset by a decrease in deferred income taxes and an increase in accounts payable and accounts payable to related parties 
for the years ended september  and  we generated net cash flow from operations of million and million  respectively 
the cash generated by operations in the year ended september  was due to an increase in the net income after adding back adjustments to reconcile net income to cash provided and decreases in accounts receivable and inventories  partially offset by an increases in income taxes receivable and decreases in accounts payable and accounts payable to related parties 
the cash generated by operations in the year ended september  was due to an increase in income and a decrease in accounts receivable  partially offset by increases in income tax benefits and other current assets and decreases in accounts payable and accounts payable to related parties 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash used in investing activities was million compared to cash provided by investing activities of million and cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal year ended september  and  respectively 
the cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was due to the million cash purchase price and direct costs associated with the acquisition of certain assets of cielo communications and gore photonics  a million increase in marketable securities resulting from our purchases being greater than the maturities  and a million increase in capital expenditures for the purchase of property  plant and equipment to upgrade  expand and automate our manufacturing and research and development operations and to relocate our headquarters  manufacturing  research and development and sales operations from chatsworth  california to our larger facility in woodland hills  california 
the increase in cash from investing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was due to an million decrease in marketable securities resulting from maturities being greater than our purchases  partially offset by a million increase in capital expenditures for the purchase of property  plant and equipment to upgrade  expand and automate our manufacturing facility 
the cash used in investing activities for fiscal year ended september  was due to a million increase in marketable securities resulting from our purchases being greater than the maturities  for the june purchase of a  square feet building in woodland hills  california for million and additional capital expenditures for the purchase of property  plant and equipment to expand and automate our manufacturing facility 
as of september   we have committed to make capital expenditures totaling approximately  during the next six months  primarily to purchase additional equipment to develop new products and to complete building improvements to our woodland hills facility 
during the fiscal year ended september   cash used by financing activities was  compared to cash used of  and cash provided of million during the fiscal years ended september  and  respectively 
the decrease in cash from financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was due to a  reduction in long term debt  partially offset by  provided by the issuance of common stock for the exercise of employee stock options and stock plan purchases 
the decrease in cash from financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was due to a  reduction in long term debt  partially offset by  provided by the issuance of common stock for the exercise of employee stock options and stock plan purchases 
the increase in cash from financing activities for the fiscal year ended september  was primarily the result of the november  completion of our initial public offering of our class a common stock 
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses  we received net proceeds from the initial public offering of approximately of million 
on january   we acquired parallel optical module assets and intellectual property from gore photonics  an industry leader in the research and development of vcsel parallel optical modules for fiber optic communication networks located in elkton  maryland  for a cash purchase price of million 
the purchase price includes the acquisition of capital equipment and inventory 
on october   we acquired certain assets of cielo communications  inc  cielo communications a research and design company located in broomfield  colorado  focused on creating vcsel technology for fiber optic communication networks for a cash purchase price and direct costs of million 
the purchase price includes the acquisition of capital equipment and intellectual property 
on april   we resolved our patent infringement litigation with stratos lightwave  inc as part of the settlement  we entered into a five year license agreement with stratos covering stratos portfolio of optoelectronic transceiver patents 
in consideration of the license agreement  we are required to pay a total of million over the five year license term 
on november   we completed an initial public offering of our class a common stock 
all  shares of class a common stock registered under the registration statement were sold at a price of per share  which amount includes exercise of the underwriters over allotment option of  shares 
after deducting the underwriting discounts and commissions and the offering expenses  we received net proceeds from the initial public offering of approximately million 
we believe that our existing cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  together with cash that we expect to generate from our operations  will be sufficient to meet our capital needs for at least the next twelve months 
however  it is possible that we may need or elect to raise additional funds to fund our activities beyond the next year or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
we could raise such funds by selling more stock to the public or to selected investors  or by borrowing money 
in addition  even though we may not need additional funds  we may still elect to sell additional equity securities or obtain credit facilities for other reasons 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to obtain additional funds on commercially favorable terms  or at all 
if we raise additional funds by issuing additional equity or convertible debt securities  the ownership percentages of existing stockholders would be reduced 
in addition  the equity or debt securities that we issue may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
although we believe we have sufficient capital to fund our activities for at least the next twelve months  our future capital requirements may vary materially from those now planned 
the amount of capital that we will need in the future will depend on many factors  including o the market acceptance of our products  o the levels of promotion and advertising that will be required to launch our new products and achieve and maintain a competitive position in the marketplace  o price discounts on our products to our customers  o our business  product  capital expenditure and research and development plans and product and technology roadmaps  o the levels of inventory and accounts receivable that we maintain  o capital improvements to new and existing facilities  o technological advances  o our competitors response to our products  o our pursuit of strategic alternatives  including future market opportunities  and o our relationships with suppliers and customers 
in addition  we may require additional capital to accommodate planned growth  hiring  infrastructure and facility needs or to consummate acquisitions of other businesses  products or technologies 
inflation inflation has not had a material adverse effect on our results of operations  however  our results of operations may be materially and adversely affected by inflation in the future 
other events on september   we announced that a special committee of our board of directors is evaluating strategic alternatives to enhance shareholder value and liquidity 
the special committee  which is comprised of our three independent directors  has retained bear stearns co 
inc  which is advising the committee in evaluating strategic alternatives  including a special dividend  share repurchase  strategic merger or sale of the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk we are currently exposed to interest rate risk on our existing term and on our investment portfolio 
our variable rate debt consists of term loan borrowing of million 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve capital 
we have not used derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our cash and cash equivalents includes million invested in money market and other interest bearing accounts 
in addition  we have million invested in marketable securities  which represents investments in united states treasury notes and treasury bonds 
as of september   our investment in marketable securities had a weighted average time to maturity of approximately days 
marketable securities represent united states treasury notes and treasury bonds with a maturity of greater than three months 
these securities are classified as held to maturity because we have the intention and ability to hold the securities to maturity 
gross unrealized gains and losses on held to maturity marketable securities have historically not been material 
maturities on held to maturity marketable debt securities range from three months to two years 
if interest rates were to increase or decrease  the result would be an annual increase or decrease of interest expense of approximately  on our term loan and an annual increase or decrease of interest income of million on our investment portfolio 
however  due to the uncertainty of the actions that would be taken and their possible effects  this analysis assumes no such action 
further  this analysis does not consider the effect of the change in the level of overall economic activity that could exist in such an environment 
foreign currency risk sales to foreign customers are denominated in us dollars and as such we have no foreign currency fluctuation risk
