financial condition total assets 
total assets increased to million at december  from million at december   an increase of 
this increase resulted primarily from growth in the loan portfolio  which was funded by deposit growth  investment maturities and borrowings 
total loans 
total loans were million and million at december   and  respectively 
commercial loans declined to million at december  from million at december   while consumer loans increased to million from million during that same period 
commercial loans as a percentage of total loans decreased to at december  from at december  and consumer loans increased to of total loans from at those dates 
at december   million  or of the company s consumer loan portfolio consisted of indirect vehicle loans compared to million  or in real estate mortgages increased to of total loans at december  from at december   while real estate construction loans increased to from as of those dates  primarily due to the favorable real estate rate environment 
loan growth contracted during the second half of the fiscal year due to the slower economy  tightened credit standards  changes in the credit administration process and increased competition 
the company has renewed its focus on community bank lending with improved customer responsiveness and streamlined lending processes

management is using a portion of the proceeds of the trust preferred securities to purchase investments and is in the process of building the portfolio with laddered staggered maturities securities that reflect the company s investment policy guidelines  collateral funding issues and help achieve the business plan of the company 
in  excess funds were invested in loans to meet the loan demand rather than in long term and generally low yielding investments such as securities 
premises and equipment 
premises and equipment  net of depreciation  were million and million at december  and  respectively

management s philosophy is to develop long term customer relationships 
during the fiscal years ended december   and  average interest earning assets were million  million and million  respectively 
during these same periods  the company s net interest margins were  and  respectively 
management believes that the best way to establish customer loyalty is by placing an emphasis on meeting the customers financial needs and providing exceptional service 
management attributes the company s successful deposit growth to continuing deposit promotions  cross sales efforts  financial planning and other means

these adjustments were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
shareholders equity 
shareholders equity was million and million at december  and  respectively 
this increase reflects earnings of million   for stock option compensation and  proceeds from stock options exercised offset by cash dividends of million and the decrease in unrealized gain on investment securities of  net of tax 
results of operations net income 
the company reported net income of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
diluted net income per share was  and for  and  respectively 
the increase in net income for each year was primarily attributable to an increase in net interest income and  to a lesser extent  increases in noninterest income partially offset by increases in noninterest expenses and an increase in the provision for loan losses 
net interest income 
the primary component of earnings for the company is net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between interest income  principally from loan and investment securities portfolios  and interest expense  principally on customer deposits and company borrowings 
changes in net interest income result from changes in volume  spread and margin 
for this purpose  volume refers to the average dollar level of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  spread refers to the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average cost of interest bearing liabilities  and margin refers to net interest income divided by average interest earning assets and is influenced by the level and relative mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities as well as levels of noninterest bearing liabilities 
net interest income for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the increase in fiscal year was million  or  and in was million  or 
these increases primarily reflect an increase in average interest earning assets  which grew million  or  in and million  or  in during these same periods  average interest bearing liabilities increased million  or  and million  or  respectively 
the average yield on interest earning assets was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  these changes are due primarily to fluctuating rates earned on loans and to a lesser degree the rates and volumes on other interest earning assets 
average yield on loans decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  average yield on loans was for the year ended december  the average yield on taxable investments decreased to for the year ended december  compared to and for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the average fully tax equivalent yield on non taxable investments remained fairly flat at for the year ended december   for the year ended december  and for the year ended december  the average yield on interest bearing liabilities was for the year ended december  compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily due to the decline in interest rates on all deposit types during  and to a lesser degree  the decrease in the cost of other borrowed funds 
net interest spread  which represents the difference between the yield on average interest earning assets and the yield on average interest bearing liabilities  was for the year ended december  compared to and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
net interest margin  which represents net interest income on a fully taxable basis divided by average interest earning assets  was compared to and  respectively  for the same periods 
the increases in net interest spread and net 
table of contents interest margin in over were primarily due to the average yields on interest bearing liabilities decreasing more than average yields on interest bearing assets

provision for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level considered by management to be adequate to provide for possible loan losses based on management s assessment of various factors affecting the loan portfolio 
these factors include the quality of the loan portfolio  problem loans  business conditions  loss experience  underlying collateral and the local economy 
the company s provision for loan losses for the years ended december   and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the provision for loan losses was increased in  and to keep pace with the strong loan growth and prospective losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
during  the allowance for loan losses increased by million 
the allowance represented of loans and of nonperforming loans at december  during  the allowance for loan losses increased by million 
the allowance represented of loans and of nonperforming loans at december  during  the allowance for loan losses increased by  the allowance represented of loans and of nonperforming loans at december  for the years ended december   and  loan charge offs  net of recoveries  amounted to million  million and million  respectively 
a large portion of the loan charge off during was the result of a single credit extended to a telecommunications contractor 
although the loan was well collateralized at origination  the equipment value depreciated rapidly because of the declining telecommunication industry and some accounts became uncollectable 
net loan charge offs attributed to indirect dealer loans were  representing of average indirect dealer loans during  compared to  or of average indirect dealer loans for the like period in management has tightened consumer lending standards over the last year and established additional guidelines and limits on lending to certain industries in order to mitigate risk 
noninterest income 
noninterest income for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively  an increase of  in  and an increase of million in the increase was primarily related to secondary market fees and gain on sale of real estate loans originated for the account of third parties  reflecting the upsurge of the mortgage loan market during the decreasing interest rate environment in and additional noninterest income of  was received in through the gain on sale of two properties 

table of contents the bank offers nondeposit investment products to customers through its subsidiary  wib financial services  inc management has a concern with the performance of the subsidiary and the product delivery system 
the company is reviewing alternatives that will provide customers with a means to achieve a balanced  diversified  managed portfolio while improving noninterest income for the bank 
noninterest expense 
noninterest expense for the years ended december   and was million  million and million  respectively  which represents an increase of in  and an increase of in these increases were mainly due to additional costs for salaries and employee benefits  occupancy expense  and other operating expense reflecting the growth of the company 
the company expects this trend in increasing noninterest expense to decline as asset growth slows and operating efficiencies improve 
the table below sets forth additional detail concerning increases in the company s noninterest expense for compared with and for compared with years ended december increase decrease increase decrease vs vs dollars in thousands salaries and benefits less loan origination costs net salaries and benefits as reported occupancy expense office supplies and printing data processing consulting and professional fees other total noninterest expense income tax 
for the years ended december   and  the company recorded income tax provisions of million  million and million  respectively 
sources of funds and liquidity and capital resources changes in cash flow 
the net change in cash  as reported in the statement of cash flows  increased by million for the year ended december  some of the more significant inflows were from the net increase in deposits and the proceeds from the issuance of trust preferred securities 
those cash inflows were partially offset by the cash outflows for loan originations  purchases of securities and repayments on federal home loan bank fhlb advances 
over the course of the year  loan principal payments contributed million to the cash inflows 
in addition  net deposits increased million and trust preferred securities were sold in the second quarter of contributing million to cash inflows 
cash inflows were used mainly to fund loan originations  which amounted to million for the year 
in addition  repayments on fhlb advances totaled million and investments in securities totaled million 
sources of funds 
the company s sources of funds are customer deposits  loan repayments  current earnings  cash and demand balances due from other banks  federal funds sold  short term investments and investment securities available for sale 
these funds are used to make loans and to support continuing operations 
management anticipates that the bank will rely primarily upon customer deposits and investments to provide liquidity in the company will mainly use such funds to make loans and to purchase securities  the majority of which are issued by federal  state and local governments 
additional funds are available through established fhlb lines of credit 
at december  the company had unused credit lines totaling million  available to the company provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met 
management is also investigating other appropriate funding sources to help finance banking operations and to maintain a favorable liquidity position and proper asset liability mix 

table of contents capital and capital ratios 
the company s shareholders equity increased to million at december  from million at december  and from million at december  the increase during was from net income  proceeds from stock options exercised and stock option compensation  less a change in unrealized gain loss on securities and dividends 
in  the increase was from net income  proceeds from stock options exercised and the increase in unrealized gain loss on securities  less dividends 
at december   shareholders equity was of total assets compared to and of total assets at december  and  respectively 
the decrease in this ratio primarily resulted from significant asset growth in and and company stock repurchases in the company approved a stock repurchase plan in april  which allowed the company to repurchase up to  shares of the company s common stock 
as of december   the company had repurchased the entire  shares at an average price of per share 
the company on a consolidated basis and the bank are subject to minimum capital requirements  under which risk percentages are assigned to various categories of assets and off balance sheet items to calculate a risk adjusted capital ratio 
tier i capital generally consists of common shareholders equity and trust preferred obligations  less goodwill and certain identifiable intangible assets  while tier ii capital includes the allowance for loan losses and subordinated debt  both subject to certain limitations 
the fdic regulations set forth the qualifications necessary for a bank to be classified as well capitalized  primarily for assignment of fdic insurance premium rates 
to qualify as well capitalized  banks must have a total risk adjusted capital ratio of at least  a tier i risk adjusted capital ratio of at least  and a leverage ratio of at least 
failure to qualify as well capitalized can a negatively impact a bank s ability to expand and to engage in certain activities  b cause an increase in fdic insurance premium rates  and c impact a bank holding company s ability to utilize certain expedited filing procedures  among other things 
as the following table indicates  the bank qualified as well capitalized at december  december  adequately well capitalized capitalized actual requirement requirement ratio total risk based capital ratio tier risk based capital ratio leverage ratio there can be no assurance that additional capital will not be required in the near future due to greater than expected growth  unforeseen expenses or revenue shortfalls or otherwise 
in addition  applicable federal and washington state regulations restrict capital distributions by institutions such as the bank  including dividends 
such restrictions are tied to the institution s capital levels after giving effect to distributions 
the company s ability to pay cash dividends is substantially dependent upon receipt of dividends from the bank 
deposits 
total deposits were million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
this represents an increase of and for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
the company generally maintains a policy not to accept brokered deposits 
management has made a concerted effort to attract deposits in the market area it serves through competitive pricing and the delivery of quality service 
the company s deposits are expected to fluctuate according to the level of the company s deposit market share  economic conditions and normal seasonal variations  among other things 
certificates of deposit are the only deposit group that have stated maturity dates 
at december   the company had million in cds of which approximately million  or  mature on or prior to december  declining interest rate markets and uncertain economic conditions may cause some customers to choose to move funds into core deposit accounts or withdraw funds  rather than renew cds as they mature 
that notwithstanding  management anticipates that a substantial portion of outstanding cds will renew upon maturity 

table of contents borrowings 
the company relies upon advances from the fhlb to supplement funding needs 
the fhlb functions as a central reserve bank providing credit for member financial institutions 
as a member  the bank is required to own capital stock in the fhlb and is authorized to apply for advances on the pledge of certain of its mortgage loans and other assets principally  securities which are obligations of  or guaranteed by  the united states provided certain standards related to creditworthiness have been met 
advances are made pursuant to several different programs 
each credit program has its own interest rate and range of maturities 
depending on the program  limitations on the amount of advances are based either on a fixed percentage of an institution s net worth or on the fhlb s assessment of the institution s creditworthiness 
under its current credit policies  the fhlb of seattle generally limits advances to of a member s assets  and overnight borrowings may not exceed of the institution s assets 
the fhlb of seattle determines specific lines of credit for each member institution 
at december  the company had a line of credit with the fhlb of million  of which million was advanced in long term borrowings 
at december   the company had million in short term borrowings original maturity of one year or less with the fhlb and million in long term borrowings 
the company also had unused lines of credit with correspondent banks in the amount of million at december  the company expects to continue to use these sources to supplement its funding as management and the board of directors deem appropriate 
investments

investment securities designated as held to maturity are those securities that the company has the ability and the intent to hold to maturity 
events that may be reasonably anticipated are considered when determining the company s intent to hold investment securities for the foreseeable future 
investment securities designated as held to maturity are carried at cost  adjusted for amortization for premiums and accretions of discounts

at december   the investment portfolio consisted of available for sale securities at carrying value 
management expects in the future that available for sale securities will increase as a percent of total investment securities at carrying value

table of contents capital expenditures and commitments the company had no material capital expenditures or commitments for the year ended december  impact of inflation and changing prices the primary impact of inflation on the company s operations is increased operating costs 
unlike most industrial companies  virtually all the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  interest rates generally have a more significant impact on a financial institution s performance than the effects of general levels of inflation 
although interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or to the same extent as the prices of goods and services  increases in inflation generally have resulted in increased interest rates 
asset liability management the company s results of operations depend substantially on its net interest income 
like most financial institutions  the company s interest income and cost of funds are affected by general economic conditions and by competition in the marketplace 
the purpose of asset liability management is to provide stable net interest income growth by protecting the company s earnings from undue interest rate risk that arises from volatile interest rates and changes in the balance sheet mix  and by managing the risk return relationships between liquidity  interest rate risk  market risk  and capital adequacy 
the company maintains an asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk by utilizing the following ratios and trend analyses liquidity  equity  volatile liability dependence  portfolio maturities  maturing assets and maturing liabilities 
the company s policy is to control the exposure of its earnings to changing interest rates by generally endeavoring to maintain a position within a narrow range around an earnings neutral position  which is defined as the mix of assets and liabilities that generate a net interest margin that is least affected by interest rate changes 
when suitable lending opportunities are not sufficient to utilize available funds  the company has generally invested such funds in securities  primarily us treasury securities  securities issued by governmental agencies  municipal securities  fhlb stock and corporate obligations 
the securities portfolio contributes to the company s profits and plays an important part in the overall interest rate management 
however  management of the securities portfolio alone cannot balance overall interest rate risk 
the securities portfolio must be used in combination with other asset liability management interest rate risk  and investing in securities that can be pledged for public deposits 
in reviewing the needs of the company with regard to proper management of its asset liability program  the company s management estimates its future needs  taking into consideration historical periods of high loan demand and low deposit balances  estimated loan and deposit increases due to increased demand through marketing  and forecasted interest rate changes 
significant accounting policies see part ii  item note c of notes to consolidated financial statements 
anticipated financial performance management anticipates that the company will grow earnings by approximately to in balance sheet targets include approximately to loan growth and to deposit growth 
future events are difficult to predict  and the expectations of management are necessarily subject to uncertainty and risk that may cause actual results to differ materially from those stated here 
one of the areas subject to uncertainty is economic stability 
although there are concerns regarding a slowdown in the economy  management expects growth to continue in the northwestern washington region and believes that the company will have opportunities to participate in that growth 
these opportunities will be pursued while applying rigorous credit discipline and thorough analysis to ensure quality growth 

table of contents management expects the net interest margin will be squeezed and anticipates some fluctuation during as deposit repricing slows 
total loans are expected to increase in volume and rates are expected to decrease slightly during the year due to increased competition 
however  the above performance goals anticipate the company s rates increase  the company could be negatively impacted due to its current slightly liability sensitive position 
other unexpected changes  such as significant declines in the economy or substantial credit deterioration  could further reduce the anticipated performance of the company 
the company recently announced the formation of a wholesale real estate lending subsidiary  washington funding group 
management expects a negative impact in the range of approximately  on the company s earnings in the first two quarters of due to start up costs of wfg 
however  management expects wfg to be profitable by year end management also announced some long term financial targets goals that the company expects to reach within the next five years 
these goals include a return on equity in excess of  an efficiency ratio in the mid range  earnings per share growth of at least per year  and dividend per share growth of at least annually 
readers should not construe these goals as assurances of future performance  and should note that management does not plan to update these projections as the year progresses 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the company is exposed to interest rate risk 
interest rate risk is the risk that financial performance will decline over time due to changes in prevailing interest rates and resulting yields on interest earning assets and costs of interest bearing liabilities 
generally  there are four sources of interest rate risk as described below repricing risk 
generally  repricing risk is the risk of adverse consequences from a change in interest rates that arises because of differences in the timing of when those interest rate changes affect an institution s assets and liabilities 
basis risk 
basis risk is the risk of adverse consequences resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different instruments with the same maturity 
yield curve risk 
yield curve risk is the risk of adverse consequences resulting from unequal changes in the spread between two or more rates for different maturities for the same instrument 
option risk 
in banking  option risks are known as borrower options to prepay loans and depositor options to make deposits  withdrawals  and early redemptions 
option risk arises whenever bank products give customers the right  but not the obligation  to alter the quantity of the timing of cash flows 
the company maintains an asset liability management policy that provides guidelines for controlling exposure to interest rate risk 
the guidelines direct management to assess the impact of changes in interest rates upon both earnings and capital 
the guidelines further provide that in the event of an increase in interest rate risk beyond preestablished limits  management will consider steps to reduce interest rate risk to acceptable levels 
although not yet used  hedging is a tool being considered for management of interest rate risk for the trust preferred securities and the selling of real estate mortgage loans 
to minimize the interest rate risk and maximize the yield  hedging practices are often used in the real estate mortgage industry 
likewise  hedging is used to offset the exposure associated with the price fluctuations of a balance sheet item such as trust preferred securities 
the company is in the process of developing policies and guidelines in order to best use this risk management tool 
a number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including income simulations and interest sensitivity gap analyses 
an income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in interest rates 
key assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets  cash flows and maturities of other investment securities  loan and deposit volumes and pricing 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  
table of contents magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
based on the results of the income simulation model as of december   the company would expect a decrease in net interest income of  if interest rates increase from current rates by basis points and an increase in net interest income of  if interest rates decrease from current rates by basis points 
the analysis of an institution s interest rate gap the difference between the repricing of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities during a given period of time is another standard tool for the measurement of the exposure to interest rate risk 
the company believes that because interest rate gap analysis does not address all factors that can affect earnings performance  it should be used in conjunction with other methods of evaluating interest rate risk 
the following table sets forth the estimated maturity or repricing  and the resulting interest rate gap of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities at december  the interest rate gaps reported in the table arise when assets are funded with liabilities having different repricing intervals 
the amounts shown below could be significantly affected by external factors such as changes in prepayment assumptions  early withdrawals of deposits and competition months months years over years total dollars in thousands interest earning assets interest earning deposits federal funds sold investment securities loans total interest earning assets percent of interest earning assets interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits money market deposits savings deposits cds trust preferred securities other borrowed funds total interest bearing liabilities percent of interest bearing liabilities interest sensitivity gap interest sensitivity gap  as a percentage of total assets cumulative interest sensitivity gap cumulative interest sensitivity gap  as a percentage of total assets the table illustrates that if assets and liabilities reprice in the time intervals indicated in the table  the company is liability sensitive months and asset sensitive thereafter 
thus  the table indicates that in an environment of increasing interest rates  the net interest income of the company would be adversely affected and in a declining interest rate environment  the company s net interest income would be favorably affected 
as stated above  certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
also  the interest rates on certain types of assets and liabilities may fluctuate in advance of changes in market interest rates  while interest rates on other types may lag behind changes in market interest rates 
for instance  while the table is based on the assumption that interest bearing demand accounts  money market accounts and savings accounts are immediately sensitive to movements in rates  the company expects that in a changing rate environment  the amount of the adjustment in interest rates for such accounts would be less than the adjustment in categories of assets  which are considered to be immediately sensitive 
additionally  certain assets have features that restrict changes in 
table of contents the interest rates of such assets both on a short term basis and over the lives of such assets 
further  in the event of a change in market interest rates  prepayment and early withdrawal levels could deviate significantly from those assumed in calculating the tables 
finally  the ability of many borrowers to service their adjustable rate debt may decrease in the event of an increase in market interest rates 
due to these shortcomings  the company places primary emphasis on its income simulation model when managing its exposure to changes in interest rates 
bond and debt obligations risk other market driven prices that affect the company s market risk are primarily prices in the markets for governmental bonds and corporate debt 
changes in market risk perceptions and risk tolerance can contribute to changes in prices of such securities affecting the company s capital and liquidity  and indirectly affecting earnings if market changes constrict portfolio management alternatives available to the company or contribute to circumstances affecting the potential impairment of a security 
the company monitors the prices of its investment securities at least once a month 
the company manages this risk primarily by setting portfolio limits  including limits by issuer  by industry  by security type  and for the overall size of its governmental bonds and corporate debt portfolios
