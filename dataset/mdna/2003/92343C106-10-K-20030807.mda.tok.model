item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related notes  which appear elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
the following discussion contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those discussed below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  particularly under the heading item business risk factors 
overview we offer products and technology that address the business portal  e commerce  and knowledge management markets  which we define broadly as intellectual capital management 
the intellectual capital management market includes enterprise intranets and corporate portals used for sharing information within an enterprise  e commerce sites for online selling  and extranets for business to business activities 
intellectual capital management solutions provide secure  personalized access to information for employees  partners  customers and suppliers  wherever that information may reside in the enterprise 
we expect that for the foreseeable future we will continue to derive the largest portion of our revenues from licensing our technology for enterprise and e commerce applications and intellectual capital management solutions 
in december  we completed the acquisition of the enterprise search assets of inktomi corporation  further expanding our product portfolio to include solutions for smaller organizations and departments within larger enterprises 
in addition to addressing these markets  the acquired enterprise search software  re branded verity ultraseek  is in use at a number of larger enterprises for search only applications as well 
we are continuing development and support of the ultraseek product line  and believe that the larger enterprises in the installed base represent an upgrade opportunity to our broader intellectual capital management solutions as their needs grow 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our critical accounting policies and estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  bad debts  income taxes and intangible assets 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition our revenues are derived from license fees for our software products and fees for services complementary to our products  including software maintenance  consulting and training 
we generally charge fees for services separately from the license fees for our software products 

table of contents we recognize revenue in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition  as amended 
the aicpa and its software revenue recognition task force continue to issue interpretations and guidance for applying the relevant standards to a wide range of sales contract terms and business arrangements that are prevalent in the software industry 
also  the securities and exchange commission sec has issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  which provides guidance related to revenue recognition based on interpretations and practices followed by the sec 
future interpretations of existing accounting standards or changes in our business practices could result in future changes in our revenue accounting policies that could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
delivery generally occurs when the product is delivered to a common carrier or made available to the customer for electronic download 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is probable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
we assess collection based on a number of factors  including past transaction history with the customer and the credit worthiness of the customer 
for all sales  we use either a binding purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
sales through our distributors are evidenced by a master agreement governing the relationship together with binding purchase orders on a transaction by transaction basis 
our arrangements do not generally include acceptance clauses 
however  if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs upon the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period 
we recognize maintenance revenues from ongoing customer support and product upgrades ratably over the term of the applicable maintenance agreement  which is typically twelve months 
generally  we receive payments for maintenance fees in advance and they are nonrefundable 
we recognize revenues for consulting and training generally when the services are performed 
for agreements with multiple elements  such as license  maintenance  training and consulting services  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement based upon its fair value as determined by vendor specific objective evidence vsoe 
vsoe of fair value for all elements of an arrangement is based upon the normal pricing and discounting practices for those products and services when sold separately 
for software license updates and product support services  vsoe is additionally measured by the renewal rate offered to the customer 
we defer revenue for any undelivered elements  and recognize revenue when the product is delivered or over the period in which the service is performed  in accordance with our revenue recognition policy for such element 
if we cannot objectively determine the fair value of any undelivered element included in bundled software and service arrangements  we defer revenue until all elements are delivered and all services have been performed  or until fair value can objectively be determined for any remaining undelivered elements 
when the fair value of a delivered element has not been established  we use the residual method to record revenue if the fair value of all undelivered elements is determinable 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is allocated to the delivered elements and is recognized as revenue 
sales returns  allowance for doubtful accounts our management must make estimates of potential future product returns related to current period product revenue 
management analyzes historical returns  current economic trends  and changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns allowance 
management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with establishing the sales returns allowance in any accounting period 
similarly  our management must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivables 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable and analyzes historical bad debts  customer concentrations  customer credit worthiness  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment terms when evaluating 
table of contents the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
as of may   our accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for sales returns of million and allowance for doubtful accounts of million 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
our income tax accounting process involves our recording the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets  as well as operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we evaluate this tax asset at each balance sheet date to determine its realizability  considering  without limitation  currently enacted tax laws  expected future taxable income and origins of the specific components of the deferred tax asset 
if we determine that it is not fully realizable  we will record a valuation allowance to reduce the asset balance to its realizable value through a charge to income tax expense 
determining whether we will be able to utilize the net operating loss carryforward requires that we estimate future taxable income and make judgments regarding the timing of future tax obligations 
actual taxable income could differ from our estimates 
as of may   we believe it is more likely than not that we will be able to realize the majority of our tax asset through expected future taxable profits  but believe that it is more probable than not that we will not be able to recover any benefits from net operating loss carryforwards originating from deductions for the exercise and or disposition of stock options in recent periods 
therefore  we recorded a valuation allowance related to this component of the deferred tax asset 
the net operating loss carryforwards originating from deductions for the exercise and or disposition of stock options and the related valuation allowance has been recorded against additional paid in capital and did not affect net income for the period 
if we conclude that other components of the deferred tax asset require a valuation allowance in the future  the effect on income tax expense could be material 
intangible assets we regularly evaluate whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate a possible impairment of goodwill 
in determining whether there is an impairment of goodwill  we calculate the estimated fair value of our company based on the closing sales price of our common stock and projected discounted cash flows as of the date we perform the impairment tests 
we then compare the resulting fair value to its respective net book value  including goodwill 
if the net book value of our company exceeds its fair value  we measure the amount of the impairment loss by comparing the implied fair value of our goodwill with the carrying amount of that goodwill 
to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value  we recognized a goodwill impairment loss 
we perform this impairment test annually and whenever facts and circumstances indicate that there is a possible impairment of goodwill 
we have completed the required annual impairment test  which resulted in no impairment for fiscal year we believe the methodology we use in testing impairment of goodwill provides us with reasonable basis in determining whether an impairment charge should be taken 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth the percentage of revenue represented by certain items in our consolidated statements of operations for the periods indicated fiscal year ended may  revenues software products service and other total revenues costs of revenues software products service and other total costs of revenues gross profit operating expenses research and development marketing and sales general and administrative in process research and development charge amortization of purchased intangible assets restructuring charge charitable contribution total operating expenses income loss from operations other income  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income years ended may   and in fiscal years  and  our management information systems mis operations expense was fully allocated to our research and development organization 
beginning in fiscal year  we will allocate our total mis expenses throughout our organization  in order to more closely match the practices of other software companies 
when compared with fiscal years through  these allocations will have the net effect in fiscal year of reducing our research and development expenses  and increasing expenses of costs of software products  costs of service and other  marketing and sales and general and administrative 
our worldwide mis expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits  capital equipment related expensed or depreciated  including associated maintenance contracts and rentals and corporate overhead allocations 
in fiscal year  these expenses were approximately million per quarter 
revenues total revenues percent change percent change dollars in millions total revenues 
table of contents the increase in total revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to a million increase in our software product revenues and to a million increase in our service and other revenues 
the increase was the result of an increase in the total number of customer transactions combined with a relatively smaller reduction in the average revenue per transaction 
fiscal year results include the addition of our ultraseek product  which came from the purchase of assets and obligations of inktomi corporation s enterprise search software business enterprise in december the decrease in total revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to the impact of the slowdown in worldwide economic conditions resulting in customers canceling or delaying orders  due to their downsizing capital spending  partly offset by increased service and other revenue derived from our installed base 
the decrease was the result of both a decrease in the total number of customer transactions and a reduction in the average revenue per transaction 
revenues derived from foreign operations accounted for  and of total revenues  in fiscal years  and  respectively 
our export sales consist of products licensed for delivery outside of the united states 
in fiscal years  and  export sales accounted for  and of total revenues  respectively 
no single customer accounted for or more of our revenues during fiscal years  or revenues derived from sales to the federal government and its agencies were  and of total revenues in fiscal years  and  respectively 
sales to government agencies will continue to fluctuate as a percentage of revenues in the future 
software product revenues percent change percent change dollars in millions software product revenues percentage of total revenues we continue to operate in a difficult global economic environment 
we experienced a modest increase in software product revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year  primarily resulting from sales of our ultraseek product  which we did not have prior to our acquisition of enterprise in december this increase was offset in part by a decrease in sales of our k product application and to decreased oem royalties 
the decrease in software product revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily a result of the continued softness in overall demand for enterprise wide software licenses resulting from the slowdown in the worldwide economy and the resulting decline in information technology capital spending 
service and other revenues percent change percent change dollars in millions service and other revenues percentage of total revenues service and other revenues consist primarily of fees for software maintenance  consulting and training 
the increase in service and other revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to million in increased sales of consulting services and to million in increased maintenance revenues which results primarily from maintenance contracts acquired as part of the enterprise purchase 
the increase in service and other revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was principally due to an increase in maintenance revenue resulting from the renewal of existing maintenance contracts from prior period 
table of contents software revenue arrangements  offset in part by decreases in consulting revenues and  to a lesser extent  training revenues due to decreased software product sales 
costs of revenues costs of software products percent change percent change dollars in millions costs of software products percentage of software product revenues costs of software products consist primarily of product media  duplication  manuals  packaging materials  shipping expenses  employee compensation expenses  royalties paid to third party vendors  and in certain instances  licensing of third party software incorporated in our products 
we anticipate that costs of software products will increase in absolute dollars when compared with fiscal year  primarily as a result of increased collateral stationery  brochures  websites  presentation templates  trade show booths  etc 
costs associated with our k product release and the addition of mis allocations beginning in fiscal year the decrease in costs of software products in absolute dollars and as a percentage of software product revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was attributable to million in decreased costs of third party software components and to million in decreased costs for manuals and other shipping expenses from the prior periods which had approximately million in total one time costs associated with the start up of european distribution operations 
we anticipate that costs of third party software components will continue to constitute a lower percentage of software product revenues as compared with fiscal years and the increase in costs of software products in absolute dollars and as a percentage of software product revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily attributable to increasing costs of third party software components 
in fiscal years  and  we did not capitalize any software development costs since such costs were not material 
costs of service and other percent change percent change dollars in millions costs of service and other percentage of service and other revenues costs of service and other consists of costs incurred in providing consulting services  customer training  telephone support and product upgrades to customers 
significant cost components include personnel related and third party contractor costs  facilities costs  travel expenses associated with training and consulting implementation services and depreciation expense 
costs of service and other will include the addition of mis allocations beginning in fiscal year the increase in costs of service and other in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to increased compensation and other employee related expenses resulting from a slightly higher average headcount 
the higher average headcount results from the addition of personnel necessary to respond to increased demand for services and in connection with the enterprise purchase in december this compares with the prior year period in which headcount began at a higher level than at any time during the first two quarters of fiscal year  but was reduced during our staffing reorganization during the quarter ended november  the decrease as a percentage of service and other revenues was related to an increase in service and other revenues 
the decrease in costs of service and other in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was principally due to reduced headcount in our professional services organization resulting from our workforce restructuring in the quarter ended november  this action more closely sized our professional services 
table of contents organization with our expected level of professional services revenues 
the decrease in costs of service and other as a percentage of service and other revenue was primarily due to the decrease in absolute dollars from reduced staffing combined with an increase in service and other revenues for the period 
operating expenses research and development percent change percent change dollars in millions research and development percentage of total revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of employee compensation and benefits  payments to outside contractors  depreciation on equipment used for development and corporate overhead allocations 
we anticipate that research and development expenditures will continue to comprise a significant percentage of total revenues because research and development is essential to maintaining our competitive position 
we believe that research and development expenses will remain approximately flat in absolute dollars approximately million in our quarter ending august   compared with our quarter ended may  this will result from an anticipated increase in compensation expenses  in part resulting from a full bonus accrual anticipated in the quarter ending august   compared with a partial reversal in quarter ended may   offset by a net reduction in mis expenses resulting from a partial allocation in the quarter ending august  when compared with a full allocation in the quarter ended may  beyond our first fiscal quarter  we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase modestly resulting from annual compensation increases 
the decrease in research and development expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to a decrease in compensation and other employee related expenses associated with the reduction in staffing in our research and development organization during each of november and  offset in part by the addition of personnel in connection with the enterprise purchase during the quarter ended february  the decrease as a percentage of total revenues was due to the decrease in absolute dollars and the increase in total revenues 
the increase in research and development expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to a million increase in research and development personnel related expenses  offset by a million reduction in outside consulting services  to focus on enhancement of existing products and development of new products addressing the business portal market  despite the staff reduction in november the increase in research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to the increase in absolute dollars combined with a decrease in total revenues for the period 
marketing and sales percent change percent change dollars in millions marketing and sales percentage of total revenues marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of employee compensation  tradeshows  outbound marketing and other lead generation activities  public relations  travel expenses associated with our sales staff and corporate overhead allocations 
we anticipate that we will continue to make significant investments in marketing and sales 
we believe that marketing and sales expenses will increase in absolute dollars when compared with the level in our quarter ended may   which was million 
this increase will result from an anticipated increase in compensation expenses resulting from an increase in staffing to support higher revenue levels  full bonus accruals in fiscal year compared with a partial reversal in quarter ended may   the addition of mis allocations beginning in fiscal year  and an increase in anticipated sales and marketing programs 
beyond our first fiscal 
table of contents quarter  we anticipate that marketing and sales expenses will increase modestly resulting from annual compensation increases 
the decrease in marketing and sales expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily due to a million decrease in compensation and other employee related expenses associated with the reduction in staffing in our marketing and sales organization during the quarters ended november  and  and the transfer of our new ceo from marketing and sales to the general and administrative organization  offset in part by the addition of personnel in connection with the enterprise purchase during the quarter ended february  the decrease in marketing and sales expenses as a percentage of total revenues was due to the decrease in absolute costs combined with the increase in total revenues for the period 
the decrease in marketing and sales expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was primarily related to a million decrease in sales commissions resulting from the decrease in software product revenues  a reduction in sales personnel resulting from our workforce restructuring in the quarter ended november   and to decreased spending on all marketing programs 
the increase in marketing and sales expenses as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was principally related to decreased total revenues for the period 
general and administrative percent change percent change dollars in millions general and administrative percentage of total revenues general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for finance  legal  human resources and general management  provisions for doubtful accounts  insurance  fees for external professional advisors and corporate overhead allocations 
we believe that general and administrative expenses will increase in absolute dollars when compared with our quarter ended may  of million  primarily resulting from the addition of mis allocations beginning in fiscal year and to increased costs associated with operating a public company and the cost of complying with the sarbanes oxley act of the decrease in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was due to a million decrease in expenses for outside professional services including legal fees  and audit and tax fees and a million decrease in bad debt expense 
this was offset in part by a million increase in insurance costs  increased compensation costs associated with the addition of personnel in connection with the enterprise purchase during the quarter ended february  and increased costs associated with transferring our new ceo to the general and administrative organization from marketing and sales 
the decrease as a percentage of total revenues was due to the decrease in absolute costs combined with the increase in total revenues for the period 
the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars from fiscal year to fiscal year was principally due to increased expenses for legal services of million  insurance premiums of million  and various tax studies and other outside professional services of million 
the increase in general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues from fiscal year to fiscal year was due the increase in absolute dollars combined with the decrease in total revenues for the period 
in process research and development percent change percent change dollars in millions in process research development nm nm percentage of total revenues total in process research and development expense of million for fiscal year was attributable to the enterprise purchase 
the methodology for allocating the purchase price to in process research and development is 
table of contents determined through established valuation techniques as outlined in the in process r d practice aid published by the american institute of certified public accountants  inc aicpa 
the fair value allocation to in process research and development was determined  and expensed upon acquisition  by identifying the research projects for which technological feasibility had not been achieved and which had no alternative future use at the acquisition date  assessing the stage and expected date of completion of the research and development effort at the acquisition date  and calculating the net present value of the cash flows by discounting expected future cash flows to present value expected to result from the successful deployment of the new technology resulting from the in process research and development effort 
the discount rates used in the present value calculations are typically derived from a weighted average cost of capital analysis and venture capital surveys  adjusted upward to reflect additional risks inherent in the development life cycle based on each in process research and development project s stage of completion 
the discount rates for existing technology and in process research and development were and  respectively 
the stages of completion were determined by estimating the costs and time incurred to date relative to the costs and time incurred to develop the in process technology into a commercially viable technology or product  while considering the relative difficulty of completing the various tasks and obstacles necessary to attain technological feasibility 
as of the acquisition date  enterprise had released ultraseek  xml toolkit  and the then latest version of quiver to the market 
current development efforts  considered in process research and development  were focused on ultraseek and xml toolkit there were no development efforts that met the criteria of in process research and development related to the quiver product line as of the acquisition date 
the estimated stage of completion of both ultraseek and xml toolkit was complete 
the development of the acquired in process research and development remains a significant risk due to the remaining efforts to achieve technical feasibility  rapidly changing customer markets  uncertain standards for new products  and significant competitive threats from several companies 
the nature of the efforts to develop these technologies into commercially viable products consists principally of completing the software development relating to the planned new functionalities  and testing activities necessary to determine that the technologies can meet market expectations  including functionality and technical requirements 
failure to bring these products to market in a timely manner could result in a loss of market share or a lost opportunity to capitalize on emerging markets  and could have a material adverse impact on our business and operating results 
the key assumptions underlying the valuations for our purchase acquisition primarily consist of an expected completion date for the in process research and development projects  estimated costs to complete these projects  revenue and expense projections assuming the products have entered the market  and discount rates based on the risks associated with the stage of completion of the in process technology acquired 
amortization of purchased intangible assets percent change percent change dollars in millions amortization nm nm percentage of total revenues during fiscal year  we amortized million of the purchased intangible assets in connection with acquired technology  patents and maintenance agreements from our enterprise purchase 
we will record quarterly amortization expenses of million associated with the purchased intangible assets of enterprise over the estimated useful life of years 
for additional information regarding purchased intangible assets  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charge percent change percent change dollars in millions restructuring charge nm percentage of total revenues 
table of contents during each of november and  we executed restructurings designed to reduce costs and to better align our expense levels with anticipated revenue levels and to ensure conservative spending during the current period of economic uncertainty 
restructuring charges dollars in millions severance costs legal and other outside services costs other charges total restructuring charges during november  we implemented a worldwide restructuring to focus on reducing expenses and improving efficiency due to continued macro economic and capital spending issues affecting the software industry 
in connection with the restructuring  we recorded in the quarter ended november   a million restructuring charge  of which approximately million was related to severance costs associated with the reduction in the worldwide workforce by approximately employees  approximately million to legal and other outside services in connection with the restructuring  and approximately million to other costs associated with the restructuring 
the restructuring impacted operations in the us  canada and the netherlands and was concentrated in research and development and  to a lesser extent  sales and marketing 
the anticipated cost savings resulting from this restructuring consist of reduced compensation expenses from the affected employees  offset by any subsequent headcount additions 
of the total million restructuring charge  approximately million remains unpaid at may  the remaining million relates to a facilities lease and will be paid out ratably over the remaining life of the lease  which terminates in october during november  we implemented a worldwide restructuring and recorded a million restructuring charge  of which approximately million was related to severance costs associated with the reduction in the worldwide workforce by employees  approximately million to legal and other outside services in connection with the restructuring and approximately million to other costs associated with the restructuring

the donation provided immediate support to established emergency assistance agencies  such as the american red cross and salvation army  both of which are founding members of the united way locally and nationally 
other income  net percent change percent change dollars in millions other income  net percentage of total revenues other income consists primarily of interest income and realized gains from our investments in marketable securities as well as gains and losses associated with our foreign currency hedging activity 

table of contents the decrease in other income in absolute dollars from fiscal year through fiscal year was primarily due to decreasing overall yields on our portfolio of marketable securities caused by the decreasing interest rate environment partially offset by higher cash balances when compared with the prior years 
income tax provision percent change percent change dollars in millions income tax provision percentage of total revenues effective tax rate income tax provision includes us and foreign income taxes  as well as the provision for us taxes on undistributed earnings of international subsidiaries 
certain items of income and expense are not reported in tax returns and financial statements in the same year 
the tax effect of this difference is reported as deferred income taxes 
during the year ended may   we assessed the qualification of our research and development expenses for state and federal research and development tax credits 
we expect the tax savings for fiscal due to research and development tax credits to result in a marginally lower effective tax rate and accordingly applied an effective tax rate of to the result of our year ended may  we will continually reassess the impact of our research and development expenses on our effective tax rate in future periods 

table of contents quarterly results of operations the following table sets forth certain unaudited consolidated statements of operations data  both in dollar amount and as a percentage of total revenues  for each of the eight quarters in the period ended may  in our opinion  this information has been presented on the same basis as the audited consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k  and all necessary adjustments  consisting only of normal recurring adjustments  have been included in the amounts stated below to present fairly the unaudited quarterly results when read in conjunction with the audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto 
the operating results for any quarter should not be relied upon as necessarily indicative of results for any future period 
we expect our quarterly operating results to fluctuate in future periods due to a variety of reasons  including those specifically discussed in item business risk factors

as of may   approximately of our portfolio matures in one year or less  with the remainder maturing in less than three years 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio

we do not hold securities for trading purposes  and therefore all securities are held for non trading purposes

table of contents foreign currency risk 
we transact business in various foreign currencies  including the euro  the british pound  the canadian dollar  the australian dollar  the swedish krona  the south african rand  the mexican peso  the brazilian real and the singaporean dollar 
we have established a foreign currency hedging program utilizing foreign currency forward exchange contracts to offset the risk associated with the effects of certain foreign currency transaction exposures 
under this program  increases or decreases in our foreign currency transactions are offset by gains and losses on the forward contracts  so as to mitigate the possibility of foreign currency transaction gains and losses 
these foreign currency transactions typically arise from intercompany transactions 
our forward contracts generally have terms of days or less 
we do not use forward contracts for trading purposes 
all foreign currency transactions and all outstanding forward contracts non equity hedges are marked to market at the end of the period with any changes in market value included in other income expense 
our ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to currency fluctuations will depend on the currency exchange rates and other factors in effect as the contracts mature 
net foreign exchange transaction gains losses included in other income  net in the accompanying consolidated of operations were   and  in fiscal  and  respectively 
the fair value of the foreign currency exchange contracts was not material to our consolidated financial statements
