critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  vendor funds  intangible assets  income taxes  assets held for sale  impairment of long lived assets  self insurance  restructuring  benefit costs  contingencies  litigation and unearned income 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions and factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company  based on its ongoing review  will make adjustments to its judgments and estimates where facts and circumstances dictate 
historically  actual results have not significantly deviated from those determined using the estimates described above 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
vendor funds the company receives funds from the many vendors whose products the company buys for resale in its stores 
these vendor funds are provided to increase the sell through of the related products 
the company receives funds for a variety of merchandising activities placement of the vendor s products in the company s advertising  placement of the vendor s products in prominent locations in the company s stores  introduction of new products into the company s distribution system and retail stores  exclusivity rights in certain categories that have slower turning products  and to compensate for temporary price reductions offered to customers on products held for sale at retail stores 
the company also receives vendor funds for buying activities  such as volume commitment rebates and forward buy credits 
accounting for vendor funds is discussed in emerging issues task force eitf issue accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  in which the eitf reached consensus on two issues in november and provided transition rules on those issues in january and march as a result of this new guidance  the company adopted a new method for recognizing the vendor funds for merchandising activities 
as of the beginning of  the company recognizes vendor funds for merchandising activities when the related products are sold 
under the previous accounting method for merchandising vendor funds  these credits were recognized as an offset to cost of sales when the merchandising activity was performed in accordance with the underlying agreements 
in connection with the implementation of this new accounting method  the company recorded a charge in of  net of tax benefit of the vendor fund inventory offset recorded as of january  was  which is a decrease from the balance as of the beginning of the inventory offset was determined by estimating the average inventory turnover rates by product category for the company s grocery  general merchandise and lobby departments these departments received over three quarters of the company s vendor funds in and by average inventory turnover rates by department for the company s remaining inventory 
long lived asset impairments the company assesses the impairment of long lived assets when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets or the asset group may not be recoverable 
the asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset if any are less than the related asset s carrying amount 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amounts of the assets exceed their fair values 
the net proceeds expected from the disposition of the asset are determined by independent quotes or expected sales prices developed by internal specialists 
estimates of future cash flows and expected sales prices are judgments based on the company s experience and knowledge of local operations 
these estimates can be significantly impacted by changes in real estate market conditions  the economic environment  capital spending decisions and inflation 
for properties to be closed that are under long term lease agreements  the present value of any remaining liability under the lease  discounted using risk free rates and net of expected sublease recovery  is recognized as a liability and expensed 
beginning on january   expected sublease recovery has been replaced by estimated sublease rentals that could be reasonably obtained for the property 
the value of any equipment and leasehold improvements related to a closed store is reduced to reflect net recoverable values 
internal specialists estimate the subtenant income  future cash flows and asset recovery values based on their historical experience and knowledge of the market in which the store to be closed is located  the results of its previous efforts to dispose of similar assets and the current economic conditions 
the actual cost of disposition for these leases and related assets is affected by specific real estate markets  the economic environment and inflation 
self insurance the company is primarily self insured for workers compensation  automobile and general liability costs 
the company records its self insurance liability  determined actuarially  based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not yet reported 
any actuarial projection of ultimate losses is subject to a high degree of variability 
sources of this variability are numerous and include  but are not limited to  future economic conditions  court decisions and legislative actions 
the company s workers compensation future funding estimates anticipate no change in the benefit structure 
statutory changes could have a significant impact on future claim costs 
the company s workers compensation liabilities are from claims occurring in various states 
individual state workers compensation regulations have received a tremendous amount of attention from state politicians  insurers  employers and providers  as well as the public in general 
recent years have seen an escalation in the number of legislative reforms  judicial rulings and social phenomena affecting this business 
the changes in a state s political and economic environment increase the variability in the unpaid claim liabilities 
legal contingencies the company records reserves for legal contingencies when the information available to the company indicates that it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
predicting the outcomes of claims and litigation and estimating related costs and exposures involve substantial uncertainties that could cause actual costs to vary materially from estimates 
in addition  the company regularly monitors its exposure to the loss contingencies associated with these matters and may from time to time change its predictions with respect to outcomes and its estimates with respect to related costs and exposures 
it is possible that material differences in actual outcomes  costs and exposures relative to current predictions and estimates  or material changes in such predictions or estimates  could have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
pension costs pension benefit obligations and the related effects on operations are dependent on the company s selection of actuarial assumptions  including the discount rate and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
actual returns on plan assets exceeded return assumptions over an extended period in the past  which kept pension expense and cash contributions to the plans at modest levels 
recent weaker market performance may significantly increase pension expense and cash contributions in the future unless asset returns again exceed the assumptions used 
changes in the interest rates used to determine the discount rate may also cause volatility in pension expense and cash contributions 
actual results that differ from the company s assumptions are accumulated and amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect the company s recognized expense and recorded obligation in such future periods 
recently adopted accounting standards the company adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets effective february  under this new statement  goodwill and certain other intangible assets with indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are subject to annual testing  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  using fair value methodology 
intangible assets with finite  measurable lives continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives until they reach their estimated residual values  and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
when sfas no 
was adopted  the aggregate of the goodwill allocated to the stores in each reporting unit became the reporting units goodwill balance 
in order to determine if a reporting unit s goodwill was impaired  a combination of internal analysis  focusing on each reporting unit s implied ebitda multiple  and estimates of fair value from valuation specialists were used 
based on these analyses  there was no impairment of goodwill at the adoption date 
subsequently  during the fourth quarter of  the company completed its annual impairment review based on november  balances and determined that there was no impairment as of that date 
the fair value estimates could change in the future depending on internal and external factors 
the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective february  this statement replaces sfas no 
regarding impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of 
the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on the company s impairment policy 
however  the statement broadens the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented 
as a result  stores associated with the company s exit from a particular market are classified as discontinued operations in the company s consolidated earnings statements 
therefore  activity associated with the company s market exit plan approved by the company s board of directors in march  involving the sale or closure of stores  two distribution centers and the reduction of division offices from to  has been presented as discontinued operations 
results of operations sales for were  compared to  in and  in the following table sets forth certain income statement components expressed as a percent to sales  and the year to year percentage changes in the amounts of such components percentage change percent to sales of dollar amounts vs 
vs 
sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses restructuring credits charges and nm nm other gain on sale of new england osco drugstores nm nm interest expense  net earnings from continuing operations before income taxes net earnings from continuing operations net loss gain from discontinued operations nm cumulative effect of change in accounting principle net nm nm net earnings nm not meaningful sales for and have been restated from previously reported amounts to exclude sales associated with discontinued operations which represent sales of the stores included in the second phase of the company s market exit plan 
the decrease in reported sales is primarily attributable to the company s restructuring plan initiated in july  which included the sale or closure of stores  and the sale of new england osco drugstores in the fourth quarter of these stores sales are included in the  and periods until their closure 
the sales decrease was offset in part by the company s capital expansion program 
sales were also impacted by declining consumer confidence as measured by the conference board index in january vs 
in january and escalating competitive activity 
identical store sales  stores that have been in operation for two full fiscal years  decreased in and increased in and in comparable store sales  which uses the same store base as the identical store sales computation except it includes replacement stores  decreased in and increased in and in during the company opened stores  remodeled stores and closed or sold stores  of which are part of the company s restructuring plans 
net retail square footage at continuing operations was million square feet at the end of and million square feet and million square feet at the end of and  respectively 
management estimates that overall deflation in products the company sells was in  in and in gross profit  as a percent to sales  increased in vs 
as a result of improved company wide procurement practices and increased generic substitution in the pharmacy department 
gross profit  as a percent to sales  remained relatively flat between and the pre tax lifo adjustment  as a percent to sales  increased gross profit by in  decreased gross profit by in  and increased gross profit by in the net pre tax lifo charge for was  comprised of of charges recorded in cost of sales  of credits recorded with gain on sale of new england osco drugstores and of credits recorded with restructuring and other 
cost of sales includes merchandise  advertising  warehousing and transportation costs  offset by vendor funds and advertising expense related to the company s buying and merchandising activities 
advertising expense excluding advertising allowances totaled in  in  and in selling  general and administrative sg a expenses as a percent to sales increased in  primarily due to the reduction in the company s sales base  increase in employee benefits and rising insurance costs 
the impact of the elimination of goodwill amortization in due to the adoption of sfas and a ten basis point reduction in labor costs as a percentage of sales was offset by increased depreciation and rent expense associated with the company s capital expenditure programs 
the increase in over was primarily due to workers compensation costs and benefit expenses caused by sharply higher health care costs 
the increase in sg a expenses was partially offset by reductions in direct labor costs 
other income  for the year ended january   includes of charges for a decrease in company owned life insurance assets  offset by of credits for stock received from the demutualization of two insurance companies 
the company s effective income tax rate from continuing operations for was  as compared to for and for the decrease resulted from the elimination of goodwill amortization and updated estimates of federal and state taxes which were lower than amounts previously estimated 
the increase for over was due to lower earnings before income taxes  non deductible restructuring expenses and increased non deductible company owned life insurance costs 
restructuring and other non routine items the financial statement presentation includes the results of two significant restructuring initiatives that were implemented in and on july   the company s board of directors approved a restructuring plan that included the closure of underperforming retail stores  reduction of administrative and corporate overhead and consolidation and elimination of four division offices refer to note f restructuring in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
on march   the company s board of directors approved the second phase of the restructuring plan which included the complete exit of four underperforming markets resulting in the sale or closure of stores  two distribution centers  and reduction of division offices from to refer to note e discontinued operations market exits in the notes to the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
although these decisions were similar  the adoption of sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets on february  caused the financial statement presentation of these actions to be dissimilar sfas no 
does not allow for the retroactive application of its provisions 
the company s and financial statements have been restated to classify the results of operations for the stores and two distribution centers as discontinued operations 
the operating results of the stores are included in continuing operations of the company s financial statements for the periods prior to their sale or closure 
discontinued operations market exits on march   the company s board of directors approved the second phase of the company s restructuring plan designed to improve future financial results and to drive future competitiveness

asset impairment adjustments resulted from the company realizing sales proceeds in excess of amounts originally estimated on stores disposed of and increases to net realizable values for stores under contract for sale 
lease liability adjustments represent more favorable negotiated settlements than had been originally estimated 
assets related to discontinued operations are recorded at their estimated net realizable value of as of january   and are reported as assets held for sale in the company s consolidated balance sheet 
these assets include land  buildings  equipment and leasehold improvements and are being actively marketed 
as of january   all stores and both distribution centers were closed 
in addition  the company had either sold or terminated the leases related to of the stores and both distribution centers as of january  other costs consist of amounts paid in connection with notification regulations and negotiated contract terminations

the company also evaluated its division management structure and the efficiency of its transaction processing departments 
based on these reviews  in july the company committed to the following restructuring activities close and dispose of underperforming stores in states  eliminate four of the existing division offices  sell a store fixture manufacturing operation  centralize certain transaction processing functions in boise  idaho  and reduce general office head count

the company is contingently liable as a guarantor of certain leases that were assigned to third parties in connection with various store closures and dispositions
