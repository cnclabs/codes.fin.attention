item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion includes forward looking statements  including but not limited to statements with respect to the future financial performance  operating results  plans and objectives of mission west properties  inc actual results may differ materially from those currently anticipated depending upon a variety of factors  including those described in part i item business risk factors 
overview and background our original predecessor was formed in as palomar mortgage investors  a california business trust  which operated as a mortgage reit until when  under the name of mission investment trust  it terminated its status as a reit and began to develop and market its own properties 
in  mission west properties was incorporated as a successor to mission investment trust 
in  our predecessor  mission west properties  sold all its real estate assets and paid a special dividend of per share to stockholders  after which it retained only nominal assets 
subsequently  the berg group acquired control of the corporation as a vehicle to acquire r d properties  or interests in entities owning such properties in a transaction completed september  at that time the berg group and the other investors acquired an aggregate controlling ownership position 
in may  we  the berg group members  john kontrabecki  and certain other persons entered into an acquisition agreement providing  among other things  for our acquisition of interests as the sole general partner in the operating partnerships 
at the time  the operating partnerships held approximately million rentable square feet of r d property located in silicon valley 
the agreement also provided for the parties to enter into the pending projects acquisition agreement  the berg land holdings option agreement and the exchange rights agreement  following stockholder approval 
effective july   we consummated our acquisition of the general partnership interests in the operating partnerships through the purchase of the general partnership interests  and all limited partnership interests in the operating partnerships were converted into  op units  which represented ownership of approximately of the operating partnerships 
our general partnership interests represented the balance of the ownership of the operating partnerships 
at december   we owned a general partnership interest in the operating partnerships  taken as a whole  on a weighted average basis 
on december   our stockholders approved and ratified our sale of common stock under two may private placements 
they also ratified the exchange rights agreement between us and the limited partners  the pending projects acquisition agreement and the berg land holdings option agreement between us and the berg group  and approved our reincorporation in the state of maryland 
on december   we sold  shares of common stock at a price of per share to a number of accredited investors to complete two may private placements 
the aggregate proceeds  net of fees and offering costs  of approximately million were used to pay down amounts outstanding under the demand notes due to the operating partnerships 
our reincorporation under the laws of the state of maryland through the merger of mission west properties into mission west properties  inc occurred on december   at which time all outstanding shares issued by our predecessor california corporation were converted into shares of our common stock on a one for one basis 
on december   the amex recommenced trading of our common stock 
in july  we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share 
the net proceeds of approximately million  after deducting underwriting discounts and other offering costs  were used primarily to repay indebtedness 
we have two wholly owned corporate subsidiaries  mit realty  inc and mission west executive aircraft center 
both corporations are inactive 
since the beginning of calendar year  we have been taxed as a qualified reit 
critical accounting policies we prepare the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap  which requires us to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that affect the reported amounts in the accompanying consolidated financial statements  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities and related footnotes 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
critical accounting policies are defined as those that require management to make estimates  judgments and assumptions  giving due consideration to materiality  in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements  and potentially result in materially different results under different conditions and assumptions 
we believe that the following best describe our critical accounting policies real estate assets 
real estate assets are stated at cost 
cost includes expenditures for improvements or replacements 
maintenance and repairs are charged to expense as incurred 
gains and losses from sales are included in income in accordance with statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for sales of real estate 
we review real estate assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
if the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its estimated undiscounted net cash flow  before interest  we will recognize an impairment loss equal to the difference between its carrying amount and its estimated fair value 
if impairment is recognized  the reduced carrying amount of the asset will be accounted for as its new cost 
for a depreciable asset  the new cost will be depreciated over the asset s remaining useful life 
generally  fair values are estimated using discounted cash flow  replacement cost or market comparison analyses 
the process of evaluating for impairment requires estimates as to future events and conditions  which are subject to varying market and economic factors  however 
therefore  it is reasonably possible that a change in estimate resulting from judgments as to future events could occur which would affect the recorded amounts of the property 
allowance for doubtful accounts and reserve 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions 
as such  we must make estimates of the uncollectability of our accounts receivable based on the evaluation of our tenants financial position  analyses of accounts receivable and current economic trends 
we also make estimates for a straight line adjustment reserve for existing tenants with the potential of bankruptcy or ceasing operations 
our estimates are based on our review of tenants payment histories  publicly available financial information and such additional information about their financial condition as tenants provided to us 
the information available to us might lead us to overstate or understate these reserve amounts 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 
moreover  actual future collections of accounts receivable or reductions in future reported rental income due to tenant bankruptcies or other business failures could differ materially from our estimates 
consolidated joint ventures 
we  through an operating partnership  own three properties that are in joint ventures of which we have interests 
we manage and operate all three properties 
the recognition of these properties and their operating results are reflected on our consolidated financial statements and minority interest because we have operational and financial control of the investments 
we make judgments and assumptions about the estimated monthly payments made to our joint venture partners  which are reported with our periodic results of operations 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
revenue recognition 
rental revenue is recognized on the straight line method of accounting required by gaap under which contractual rent payment increases are recognized evenly over the lease term 
the difference between recognized rental income and rental cash receipts is recorded as deferred rent on the balance sheet 
certain lease agreements contain terms that provide for additional rents based on reimbursement of certain costs 
these additional rents are reflected on the accrual basis 
rental revenue is affected if existing tenants terminate or amend their leases 
thus  if tenants lengthen their lease term  additional rental revenue is recognized 
on the other hand  if tenants terminate their lease agreements or shorten their lease terms  rental revenue decreases because of reduced future cash flows and a one time straight line adjustment to deferred rent  which is the difference between recognized rental income and rental cash receipts 
we try to identify tenants who have the potential of bankruptcy or of ceasing operations 
by anticipating these events in advance  we expect to take actions to minimize the effect on the results of our operations 
our judgments and estimations about tenants capacity to continue to meet their lease obligations will affect the rental revenue recognized 
material differences may result in the amount and timing of our rental revenue for any period if we made different judgments or estimations 
lease termination 
lease termination fees are included in revenues 
these fees are paid by tenants who want to terminate their lease obligations before the end of the contractual term of the lease 
there is no way of predicting or forecasting the timing or amounts of future lease termination fees

at december   the outstanding balance remaining under the demand notes owed to the operating partnerships was million 
the company and the operating partnerships have agreed to extend the due date of the demand notes to september  the principal of the demand notes  along with the interest expense  which is interest income to the operating partnerships  is eliminated in consolidation and is not included in the corresponding line items within the consolidated financial statements 
however  the interest income earned by the operating partnerships  which is interest expense to us  in connection with this debt  is included in the calculation of minority interest as reported on the consolidated statement of operations  thereby reducing our net income by this same amount 
at present  our only means for repayment of this debt is through distributions received from the operating partnerships in excess of the amount of dividends to be paid to our stockholders 
historical cash flows comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to approximately million for the prior year 
the increase in cash resulted from increased rental receipts attributable to newly acquired properties 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the prior year 
cash used in investing activities during related to the acquisition of three r d properties through a tax deferred exchange transaction involving the property sold to xilinx  inc pursuant to its purchase option as well as new equipment and improvements net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during  we paid debt principal and made distributions to holders of our common stock and op units utilizing cash generated from operating activities and other borrowed funds 
financing activities in also consisted of a million uncollateralized loan from citicorp usa  inc and a million line of credit established with cupertino national bank of which million had been drawn as of the year end 
for the year ended december   we paid dividends to our stockholders and made distributions to the op unit holders totaling approximately million  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december net cash provided by operating activities for the year ended december  was approximately million  compared to approximately million for the prior year 
the change was a direct result of increased rent from newly acquired properties and higher rental rates under existing leases 
net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the prior year 
cash used in investing activities during related to improvements and the amortization of the xilinx purchase option deposit 
net cash used in financing activities was approximately million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  during  we paid debt principal and made distributions to holders of our common stock and op units utilizing cash generated from operating activities 
for the year ended december   we paid dividends to our stockholders and made distributions to the op unit holders totaling approximately million  compared to approximately million for the year ended december  capital expenditures the properties require periodic investments of capital for tenant related capital expenditures and for general capital improvements 
for the years ended december  through december   the recurring tenant improvement costs and leasing commissions incurred with respect to new leases and lease renewals of the properties previously owned or controlled by members of the berg group averaged approximately million annually 
we will have approximately  rentable square feet under expiring leases in we expect that the average annual cost of recurring tenant improvements and leasing commissions  related to these properties  will be approximately million during we believe we will recover substantially all of these sums from the tenants under the new or renewed leases through increases in rental rates 
until we actually sign the leases  however  we cannot assure you that this will occur 
capital expenditures may fluctuate in any given period subject to the nature  extent  and timing of improvements required to be made to the properties 
tenant improvements and leasing costs may also fluctuate in any given period year depending upon factors such as the property  the term of the lease  the type of lease and the overall market conditions 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements for the funding of property acquisitions and other material non recurring capital improvements through long term secured and unsecured indebtedness and the issuance of additional equity securities by the company  but cannot be assured that we will be able to meet our requirements on favorable terms 
see policy with respect to certain activities financing policies 
funds from operations as defined by the nareit  ffo represents net income loss before minority interest of op unit holders  computed in accordance with gaap  including non recurring events other than extraordinary items under gaap and gains and losses from sales of depreciable operating properties  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization  excluding amortization of deferred financing costs and depreciation of non real estate assets  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
management considers ffo an appropriate measure of performance of an equity reit because  along with cash flows from operating activities  financing activities and investing activities  it provides investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
with the recent emphasis on the disclosure of operating earnings per share  we will still continue to use ffo as a measure of the company s performance 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative for net income as a measure of profitability nor is it comparable to cash flows provided by operating activities determined in accordance with gaap  nor is ffo necessarily indicative of funds available to meet our cash needs  including our need to make cash distributions to satisfy reit requirements 
for example  ffo is not adjusted for payments of debt principal required under our service debt obligations 
our definition of ffo also assumes conversion at the beginning of the period of all convertible securities  including minority interests that might be exchanged for common stock 
our ffo does not represent the amount available for management s discretionary use  as such funds may be needed for capital replacement or expansion  debt service obligations or other commitments and uncertainties 
furthermore  ffo is not comparable to similarly entitled items reported by other reits that do not define ffo exactly as we do 
ffo for the years ended december  and is as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands net income   add minority interest   depreciation   less gain on sales of assets   ffo   the minority interest for unrelated parties was deducted from total minority interest in calculating ffo 
overview of distribution policy we intend to make regular quarterly distributions to stockholders and op unit holders based on our fad  which is calculated as ffo less straight line rents  leasing commissions paid  and capital expenditures made during the respective period 
our ability to make such distributions will be affected by numerous factors including  most importantly  the receipt of distributions from the operating partnerships 
fad does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with gaap and is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund cash needs 
the actual return that we will realize and the amount available for distributions to stockholders will be affected by a number of factors  including the revenues received from our properties  our operating expenses  debt service on borrowings  and planned and unanticipated capital expenditures 
we anticipate that cash available for distribution will exceed earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes  as the latter figure takes into account non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization  that we will incur 
distributions  other than capital gain distributions  by us to the extent of our current and accumulated earnings and profits for federal income tax purposes most likely will be taxable to us stockholders as ordinary dividend income unless a stockholder is a tax exempt entity 
distributions in excess of earnings and profits generally will be treated as a non taxable reduction of the us stockholder s basis in the common stock to the extent of such basis  and thereafter as taxable gain 
the percentage of such distributions in excess of earnings and profits  if any  may vary from period to period 
distributions are determined by our board of directors and depend on actual fad  our financial condition  capital requirements  the annual distribution requirements under the reit provisions of the code and such other factors as the board of directors deems relevant 
for a discussion of the risk that we will not meet our distribution objectives  see part i  item  business risk factors stockholders are not assured of receiving cash distributions from us 
the calculation of fad for the years ended december  and is as follows for the year ended december  dollars in thousands ffo   less straight line rents  leasing commissions capital expenditures  fad   policies with respect to certain activities we have adopted policies with respect to investment  financing  conflicts of interest and other activities 
these policies have been formulated by our board of directors  are set forth in our charter  bylaws  operating partnership agreements or agreements with the berg group  and generally may be amended or revised from time to time  subject to applicable agreement terms  at the discretion of the board of directors without a vote of the stockholders 
among other things  these policies provide that so long as the berg group members and their affiliates  other than us and the operating partnerships  beneficially own  in the aggregate  at least of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis  the approval of a majority of our directors  including carl e 
berg or his designee as a director  and of the holders of a majority of the op units is required for us to take title to assets  other than temporarily in connection with an acquisition prior to contributing such assets to the operating partnerships  or to conduct business other than through the operating partnerships  or for us or the operating partnerships to engage in any business other than the ownership  construction  development and operation of real estate properties  or for certain fundamental corporate actions  including amendments to our charter  bylaws or any operating partnership agreement and any merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets or the assets of the operating partnerships  changes in certain policies with respect to conflicts of interest must be consistent with legal requirements  certain policies with respect to competition by the berg group are imposed pursuant to provisions of the acquisition agreement that cannot be amended or waived without the approval of the independent directors committee of our board of directors  we cannot take any action intended to terminate our qualification as a reit without the approval of more than of the entire board of directors  and we cannot undertake certain other specified transactions  including the issuance of debt securities  and borrowings in excess of specified limits  or the amendment of our charter and bylaws  without the approval of more than of the entire board of directors 
investment policies we expect to pursue our business and investment objectives principally through the direct ownership by the operating partnerships of our properties and future acquired properties 
development or investment activities are not limited to any specified percentage of our assets 
we may also participate with other entities in property ownership  through joint ventures or other types of co ownership 
equity investments may be subject to existing mortgage financing and other indebtedness that have priority over our equity interests 
while we will emphasize equity real estate investments  we may  in our discretion and subject to the percentage ownership limitations and gross income tests necessary for reit qualification  invest in mortgage and other real estate interests  including securities of other real estate investment trusts 
we have not previously invested in mortgages or securities of other real estate investment trusts  and we do not have any present intention to make such investments 
financing policies to the extent that our board of directors determines to seek additional capital  we may raise such capital through additional equity offerings  debt financing or retention of cash flow  or through a combination of these sources  after consideration of provisions of the code requiring the distribution by a reit of a certain percentage of its taxable income and taking into account taxes that would be imposed on undistributed taxable income 
it is our present intention that any additional borrowings will be made through the operating partnerships  although we may incur borrowings that would be reloaned to the operating partnerships 
borrowings may be unsecured or may be secured by any or all of our assets  the operating partnerships or any existing or new property  and may have full or limited recourse to all or any portion of our assets  the operating partnerships or any existing or new property 
we have not established any limit on the number or amount of mortgages that may be placed on any single property or on our portfolio as a whole 
we may also determine to finance acquisitions through the exchange of properties or the issuance of additional op units in the operating partnerships  shares of common stock or other securities 
in the event that the board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital  it has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue additional shares of common stock  preferred stock or other capital stock  including securities senior to the common stock  in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
in the event that we issue any shares of common stock or securities convertible into or exchangeable or exercisable for  shares of common stock  subject to limited exceptions  such as the issuance of common stock pursuant to any stock incentive plan adopted by us or pursuant to limited partners exercise of the exchange rights or the put rights  the limited partners will have the right to purchase common stock or such securities in order to maintain their respective percentage interests in us on a fully diluted basis 
if the board of directors determines that we will raise additional equity capital to fund investments by the operating partnerships  we will contribute such funds to the operating partnerships as a contribution to capital and purchase of additional general partnership interest  however  holders of op units will have the right to participate in such funding on a pro rata basis 
in the event that holders of op units sell their op units to us upon exercise of their put rights  we are authorized to raise the funds for such purchase by issuing additional shares of common stock 
alternatively  we may issue additional shares of common stock in exchange for the tendered op units 
our board of directors also has the authority to cause the operating partnerships to issue additional op units in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration  as it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
in the event that the operating partnerships issue new op units for cash  but not property  the limited partners holding op units in an operating partnership will have the right to purchase op units in order  and to the extent necessary  to maintain their respective percentage interests in that operating partnership 
the new op units will be exchangeable for common stock pursuant to the exchange rights or may be tendered to us pursuant to the put rights 
disposition policies we have no current intention of disposing of any of our properties  although we reserve the right to do so 
the tax basis of the limited partners in the properties in the operating partnerships is substantially less than current fair market value 
accordingly  prior to the disposition of their op units  upon a disposition of any of the properties  a disproportionately large share of the gain for federal income tax purposes would be allocated to the limited partners 
consequently  it may be in the interests of the limited partners that we continue to hold the properties in order to defer such taxable gain 
in light of this tax effect  the operating partnership agreements provide that  until january  or until the berg group members and their affiliates  other than us and the operating partnerships  beneficially own  in the aggregate  less than of the outstanding shares of common stock on a fully diluted basis  if earlier  carl e 
berg and clyde j 
berg may prohibit the operating partnerships from disposing of properties which they designate in a taxable transaction 
mr 
kontrabecki has a similar right with respect to seven of the properties  which right will lapse before the end of the ten year period if his beneficial ownership interest falls below  op units 
the limited partners may seek to cause us to retain the properties even when such action may not be in the interests of some  or a majority  of our stockholders 
the operating partnerships will be able to effect tax deferred  like kind exchanges under section of the code  or in connection with other non taxable transactions  such as a contribution of property to a new partnership  without obtaining the prior written consent of these individuals 
the approval of a majority of our directors  including carl e 
berg or his designee  will be required to sell all or substantially all of our assets 
the consent of the holders of a majority of the op units will be required to effect a sale or sales of all  or substantially all  of the assets of any of the operating partnerships 
impact of recently issued accounting standards we do not believe that recently issued accounting standards will materially impact our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we do not generally hold market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
we use fixed and variable rate debt to finance our operations 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our current and future debt obligations 
we are vulnerable to significant fluctuations of interest rates on our floating rate debt 
we manage our market risk by monitoring interest rates where we try to recognize the unpredictability of the financial markets and seek to reduce potentially adverse effect on the results of our operations 
this takes frequent evaluation of available lending rates and examination of opportunities to reduce interest expense through new sources of debt financing 
several factors affecting the interest rate risk include governmental monetary and tax policies  domestic and international economics and other factors that are beyond our control 
the following table provides information about the principal cash flows  weighted average interest rates  and expected maturity dates for debt outstanding as of december  the current terms of this debt are described in item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
average interest rates are based on implied libor for the respective time period 
fair value approximates book value for fixed rate debt 
of the projected fair value of secured notes payable  approximately million represents the prudential secured loan 
for variable rate debt  the table presents the assumption that the outstanding principal balance at december  will be paid upon maturity 
for fixed rate debt  the table presents the assumption that the outstanding principal balance at december  will be paid according to scheduled principal payments and that we will not prepay any of the outstanding principal balance 
thereafter total fair value variable rate debt dollars in thousands secured and unsecured debt     weighted average interest rate fixed rate debt secured notes payable         weighted average interest rate the variable rate debt represented and  and the fixed rate debt represented and of all debt outstanding for the years ended december  and  respectively 
all of the debt is denominated in united states dollars 
the weighted average interest rate for variable rate debt was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the difference in spread was due to numerous cuts in interest rates by the federal reserve during and the weighted average interest rate for fixed rate debt was approximately and for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the difference in interest expense attributable to the average interest rate difference between and was  we do not anticipate interest rate changes in that would result in a change in interest expense significantly larger than we experienced from to the primary market risk we face is the risk of interest rate fluctuations 
the berg group line of credit  the cupertino national bank line of credit  and the citicorp usa  inc loan  which are tied to a libor  based interest rate  were approximately million  or  of the total million of debt as of december  as a result  we pay lower rates of interest in periods of decreasing interest rates and higher rates of interest in periods of increasing interest rates 
in early  with the proceeds that we received from the million secured mortgage loan with northwestern mutual life insurance company  we paid million to citicorp usa  inc  million to cupertino national bank and million to the berg group 
the citicorp usa  inc loan was retired in march  but we anticipate drawing upon on the lines of credit with cupertino national bank and the berg group in the future 
at december   we had no interest rate caps or interest rate swap contracts 
the following discussion of market risk is based solely on a possible hypothetical change in future market conditions related to our variable rate debt 
it includes forward looking statements regarding market risk  but we are not forecasting the occurrence of these market changes 
based on the amount of variable debt outstanding as of december   a increase or decrease in interest rates on our million of floating rate debt would decrease or increase  respectively  annual earnings and cash flows by approximately million  as a result of the increased or decreased interest expense associated with the change in rate  and would not have an impact on the fair value of the floating rate debt 
this amount is determined by considering the impact of hypothetical interest rates on our borrowing cost 
due to the uncertainty of fluctuations in interest rates and the specific actions that might be taken by us to mitigate of such fluctuations and their possible effects  the foregoing sensitivity analysis assumes no changes on our financial structure
