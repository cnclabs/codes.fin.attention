overview allscripts healthcare solutions is a leading provider of clinical software and information solutions for physicians 
our key offerings fall into three business segments 
our software and services segment is comprised primarily of our touchworks software business 
touchworks is a modular electronic medical record memr designed to enhance physician productivity using a wireless handheld device  tablet pc  or desktop workstation to automate the most common physician activities 
our information services segment is comprised primarily of physicians interactive pi business 
pi links physicians with pharmaceutical companies and medical suppliers using interactive education sessions to provide product information to the physician 
finally  our prepackaged medications segment is comprised of our allscripts direct business 
allscripts direct provides point of care medication  and medical supply management solutions for physicians 
from our inception in through  we focused almost exclusively on the sale of prepackaged medications to physicians  in particular those with a high percentage of fee for service patients 
the advent of managed prescription benefit programs required providers to obtain reimbursement for medications dispensed from managed care organizations rather than directly from their patients 
this new reimbursement methodology made it more difficult for our physician customers to dispense medications to their patient base 
in  under the direction of a new executive management team  we focused our efforts on the information aspects of medication management  including the development of technology tools necessary for electronic prescribing  routing of prescription information and submission of medication claims for managed care reimbursement 
in january  we introduced the first version of our touchscript software that fully incorporated these features 
at the same time  we redirected our sales and marketing efforts away from our traditional fee for service customer base to physicians who had a large percentage of managed care patients 
we recognized that there was a larger market opportunity among physicians whose patients are covered by managed care plans because the portion of prescriptions covered by managed care plans increased dramatically relative to the portion of fee for service prescriptions 
further  we believed and continue to believe that our technology provides a competitive advantage where more patients prescriptions are covered by managed care plans because our products streamline the process by which physicians  managed care organizations and patients interact 
in  we acquired telemed corp 
and its physicians interactive business 
physicians interactive has evolved into a leading provider of medication product information to physicians using interactive education sessions via the internet 
to expand our technology focused solutions  in may  we acquired masterchart  inc  a software developer providing dictation  integration and patient record technology  and medifor  inc  a provider of electronic patient education 
in addition  in january  we acquired channelhealth incorporated  a software developer providing modular software for physicians to access medical information and manage clinical workflow 
the integration of the technology obtained in these acquisitions along with our electronic prescribing technology formed the core of our touchworks software 
we provide three key product and service offerings  each of which focus on the physician 
allscripts direct provides medication management solutions for physicians 
touchworks provides software that automates the most common physician activities 
physicians interactive provides interactive educational opportunities for the physician 
we believe that touchworks and physicians interactive represent our largest potential for growth 
in july  we announced and began implementation of a restructuring plan to realign our organization  prioritize our initiatives around those high growth areas of our business  focus on profitability  reduce operating expenses and improve efficiencies in light of the aforementioned acquisitions  and the commitment to focus sales and service efforts on larger physician practices  academic medical centers  and integrated delivery networks 
the restructuring plan included workforce and overhead reductions  and the termination of certain strategic agreements and unprofitable customer contracts 
as a result of the restructuring plan  we recorded restructuring and other charges of  and  respectively  during the third quarter of in addition  certain events and changes in circumstances caused us to conduct a review of the carrying value of our goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
these events included the restructuring plan  the business climate  which generated significant valuation declines of enterprises in our industry  and the failure of certain assets to generate the cash flows that were projected at the time of acquisition 
as a result of this review  we recorded an asset impairment charge of  during we currently organize our business around the three aforementioned segments prepackaged medications  software and related services  and information services 
the prepackaged medications segment derives its revenue from the repackaging  sale  and distribution of medications and medical supplies 
the software and related services segment derives its revenue from the sale and installation of software that provides point of care decision support solutions and the resale of related hardware 
the information services segment primarily derives its revenue from the sale of interactive physician education sessions 
the composition of our revenue by segment is as follows quarter ended march june sept

unaudited prepackaged medications     software and related services     information services     total revenue      cost of revenue for the prepackaged medications segment consists primarily of the cost of the prepackaged medications  the salaries  bonuses and benefits for the repackaging personnel  shipping costs  repackaging facility and other related expenses 
cost of revenue for the software and related services segment consists primarily of the salaries  bonuses and benefits of our billable professionals  third party software costs  hardware cost  capitalized software amortization and other direct engagement costs 
cost of revenue for the information services segment consists primarily of salaries  bonuses and benefits of our program management and program development personnel  costs to recruit physicians and other program management expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for all three segments consist primarily of salaries  bonuses and benefits for management and support personnel  facilities costs  depreciation and amortization  general operating expenses  non capitalizable product development expenses  and selling and marketing expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for each segment consist of expenses directly related to that segment and an allocated portion of corporate expenses 
discontinued operations the operating results of our pharmacy benefit management business  which we sold in march  have been segregated from continuing operations and reported as a separate line item on the consolidated statements of operations under the caption income from discontinued operations 
additionally  the gain we recognized from the sale of this business has been reported as a separate line item under the caption gain from sale of discontinued operations 
the gain of  for the twelve months ended december  represents final payment of contingent consideration related to the sale 
income from discontinued operations for the twelve months ended december  totaled see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a discussion of these operations 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  collectibility of accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets  capitalized software  and realization of deferred tax assets 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition revenue from software licensing arrangements where the service element is considered essential to the functionality of the other elements of the arrangement is accounted for under the provisions of american institute of certified public accountants statement of position sop  accounting for peformance of construction type contracts and certain production type contracts 
sop requires that management make estimates of the total value of the contract as well as the percentage of the contract that has been completed as of the end of each period 
changes in circumstances may cause management s estimates of the value of the contract or the effort required to complete the services to change 
the changes may cause allscripts to adjust downward the amount of revenue recognized or recognize less revenue than anticipated through the completion of the project 
for a more complete description of our revenue recognition policy  please refer to note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories we adjust the value of our inventory downward for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
fixed assets we estimate the useful lives of our fixed asset purchases and depreciate the cost over that estimated life 
if the actual useful life is shorter than our estimated useful life  the asset may be deemed to be impaired and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset may be required 
goodwill and intangible assets we evaluate the value of intangible assets based upon the present value of the future economic benefits expected to be derived from the assets 
we assess the impairment of the identifiable intangibles and goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
if we determine that the value of the intangible assets and goodwill may not be recoverable from future cash flows  a write down of the value of the asset may be required 
we estimate the useful lives of our intangible assets and amortize the value over that estimated life 
if the actual useful life is shorter than our estimated useful life  the asset may be deemed to be impaired and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset may be required 
software capitalization the value of capitalized software is dependent upon the ability to recover its value through future revenue from the sale of the software 
if we determine in the future that the value of the capitalized software could not be recovered  a write down of the value of the capitalized software to its recoverable value may be required 
we estimate the useful life of our capitalized software and amortize the value over that estimated life 
if the actual useful life is shorter than our estimated useful life  the asset may be deemed to be impaired and  accordingly  a write down of the value of the asset may be required 
deferred taxes we record a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
as of december   we had a valuation allowance equal to the entire amount of net deferred tax assets 
if we had a valuation allowance less than the total deferred tax asset and we were to determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of the deferred tax asset  an adjustment would be charged to income in the period the determination was made 
likewise  should we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of our net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period the determination was made

however  any projections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial uncertainty 
we will  from time to time  consider the acquisition of  or investment in  complementary businesses  products  services and technologies  which might impact our liquidity requirements or cause us to issue additional equity or debt securities

recent accounting pronouncements in june  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations was issued 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for obligations  required by law  associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
the associated asset retirement costs are capitalized as a part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset 
this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  we do not expect that the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

this statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal years ended after december  and are included in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
we are currently evaluating the impact of this pronouncement  but do not expect that the adoption of this statement would have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
risk factors you should carefully consider the risks and uncertainties described below and other information in this report 
these are not the only risks and uncertainties that we face 
additional risks and uncertainties that we do not currently know about or that we currently believe are immaterial may also harm our business operations 
if any of these risks or uncertainties occurs  it could have a material adverse effect on our business 
risks related to allscripts healthcare solutions  inc if physicians do not accept our products and services  our growth will be impaired 
our business model depends on our ability to sell our touchworks and physicians interactive products and services to physicians and other healthcare providers and to generate usage by a large number of physicians 
we have not achieved this goal with previous or currently available versions of our touchworks and physicians interactive products and services 
physician acceptance of our products and services will require physicians to adopt different behavior patterns and new methods of conducting business and exchanging information 
we cannot assure you that physicians will integrate our products and services into their office work flow or that participants in the pharmaceutical healthcare market will accept our products and services as a replacement for traditional methods of conducting healthcare transactions 
achieving market acceptance for our products and services will require substantial marketing efforts and the expenditure of significant financial and other resources to create awareness and demand by participants in the healthcare industry 
if we fail to achieve broad acceptance of our products and services by physicians and other healthcare participants or to position our services as a preferred method for pharmaceutical healthcare delivery and information management  our prospects for growth will be diminished 
we are currently experiencing losses and we may not become profitable in the future 
we are currently experiencing losses and cannot assure you that we will become profitable in the foreseeable future  if ever 
for the year ended december   we had a net loss of  we cannot be certain that we will achieve profitability  and even if we do achieve profitability  we may be unable to sustain or increase our profitability in the future 
because our business model is unproven  our operating history is not indicative of our future performance  and our business is difficult to evaluate 
because we have not yet successfully implemented our business model  which changed substantially in connection with our acquisition of channelhealth  we do not have an operating history upon which you can evaluate our prospects 
in attempting to implement our business model  we significantly changed our business operations  sales and implementation practices  customer service and support operations and management focus 
we are also facing new risks and challenges  including a lack of meaningful historical financial data upon which to plan future budgets  the need to develop strategic relationships and other risks described below 
our business will be harmed if we cannot maintain the strategic alliance agreement and the cross license agreement with idx 
in connection with the channelhealth acquisition  we entered into a year strategic alliance agreement with idx pursuant to which allscripts and idx agreed to coordinate product development and align our respective marketing processes 
under this agreement  idx granted us the exclusive right to market  sell  license and distribute ambulatory point of care and clinical application products to idx customers 
this agreement does not  however  limit idx s continued development and distribution of its own lastword n k a carecast or radiology products and services 
our business strategy includes targeting current and prospective idx customers and their affiliates 
if we fail to successfully implement that business strategy  we may not be able to achieve projected results or support the price paid for channelhealth 
if the strategic alliance agreement is terminated  we would lose access to an important customer base 
after the expiration or termination of the strategic alliance agreement  we may not be able to align with another company to market and distribute our products on as favorable a basis as that represented by the idx strategic alliance 
this would harm our growth and revenue 
in addition  prior to the termination of this agreement  we cannot allow certain specified idx direct competitors to market  distribute or sell our services  even if that agreement would benefit our business 
upon completion of the channelhealth acquisition  channelhealth entered into an amended and restated cross license and software maintenance agreement with idx pursuant to which channelhealth granted idx a license to use  market and sublicense its products combined with idx products  and idx granted channelhealth a license to use  market and sublicense idx software for use with channelhealth products 
if this agreement is terminated  channelhealth will not have access to certain idx software  which would harm our ability to integrate our services with idx systems and provide real time data synchronization 
this would make our systems less desirable to idx customers and would harm our business 
our growth and revenues could suffer if we are unable to enter into and maintain relationships with idx customers 
we seek to increase our subscriber base through targeting provider organizations that use idx practice management systems or other idx services  and affiliates of these organizations 
our services use the web framework technology  which we license from idx  and which enables our software applications and services to be tightly integrated with idx practice management systems and provide real time synchronization of data 
if our relationship with idx terminates  our services might not be as attractive to idx customers and we may not have access to this potential customer base 
in such an event  idx might enter into arrangements that would allow our competitors to utilize idx technology and idx could compete against us 
if any of these situations were to occur  our expected revenues may be lower  our business may be harmed and our stock price may fall 
if we are unable to successfully introduce new products  our business prospects will be impaired 
the successful implementation of our business model depends on our ability to introduce new products and to introduce these new products on schedule 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to introduce new products or our products currently under development on schedule  or at all 
in addition  early releases of software often contain errors or defects 
we cannot assure you that  despite our extensive testing  errors will not be found in our new product releases and services before or after commercial release  which would result in product redevelopment costs and loss of  or delay in  market acceptance 
a failure by us to introduce planned products or other new products or to introduce these products on schedule could have a material adverse effect on our business prospects 
our business will not be successful unless we establish and maintain strategic relationships 
to be successful  we must establish and maintain strategic relationships with leaders in a number of healthcare and internet industry segments 
this is critical to our success because we believe that these relationships will enable us to extend the reach of our products and services to a larger number of physicians and to other participants in the healthcare industry  develop and deploy new products  further enhance the allscripts brand  and generate additional revenue 
entering into strategic relationships is complicated because some of our current and future strategic partners may decide to compete with us in some or all of our markets 
in addition  we may not be able to establish relationships with key participants in the healthcare industry if we have relationships with their competitors 
moreover  many potential strategic partners have resisted  and may continue to resist  working with us until our products and services have achieved widespread market acceptance 
once we have established strategic relationships  we will depend on our partners ability to generate increased acceptance and use of our products and services 
to date  we have established only a limited number of strategic relationships  and many of these relationships are in the early stages of development and may not achieve the objectives that we seek 
we have limited experience in establishing and maintaining strategic relationships with healthcare and internet industry participants 
if we lose any of these strategic relationships or fail to establish additional relationships  or if our strategic relationships fail to benefit us as expected  we may not be able to execute our business plan  and our business will suffer 
if potential customers take a long time to evaluate the purchase of our products and services  we could incur additional selling expenses and require additional working capital 
the length of the sales cycle for our current touchworks product and physician education services depends on a number of factors  including the nature and size of the potential customer and the extent of the commitment being made by the potential customer  and is difficult to predict 
our marketing efforts with respect to large healthcare organizations generally involve a lengthy sales cycle due to these organizations complex decision making processes 
if potential customers take longer than we expect to decide whether to purchase our solutions  our selling expenses could increase  and we may need to raise additional capital sooner than we would otherwise need to 
if we are unable to maintain existing relationships and create new relationships with managed care payers  our prospects for growth may suffer 
we rely on managed care organizations to reimburse our physician customers for prescription medications dispensed in their offices 
while many of the leading managed care payers and pharmacy benefit managers currently reimburse our physicians for in office dispensing  none of these payers is under a long term obligation to do so 
if we are unable to increase the number of managed care payers that reimburse for in office dispensing  or if some or all of the payers who currently reimburse physicians decline to do so in the future  utilization of our products and  therefore  our growth will be impaired 
if we cannot keep pace with advances in technology  our business could be harmed 
if we cannot adapt to changing technologies  our products and services may become obsolete  and our business could suffer 
because the internet and healthcare information markets are characterized by rapid technological change  we may be unable to anticipate changes in our current and potential customers requirements that could make our existing technology obsolete 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to continue to enhance our existing products and services  develop new technology that addresses the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our prospective customers  license leading technologies and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a timely and cost effective basis 
the development of our proprietary technology entails significant technical and business risks 
we may not be successful in using new technologies effectively or adapting our proprietary technology to evolving customer requirements or emerging industry standards 
our future success depends upon our ability to grow  and if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet our customers requirements 
we will need to expand our operations if we successfully achieve market acceptance for our products and services 
we cannot be certain that our systems  procedures  controls and existing space will be adequate to support expansion of our operations 
our future operating results will depend on the ability of our officers and key employees to manage changing business conditions and to implement and improve our technical  administrative  financial control and reporting systems 
an unexpectedly large increase in the volume or pace of traffic on our web site or the number of orders placed by customers may require us to expand and further upgrade our technology 
we may not be able to project the rate or timing of increases in the use of our web site accurately or to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate these increases 
difficulties in managing any future growth could have a significant negative impact on our business because we may incur unexpected expenses and be unable to meet our customers requirements 
if we lose the services of our key personnel  we may be unable to replace them  and our business could be negatively affected 
our success depends in large part on the continued service of our management and other key personnel and our ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
in particular  the services of glen e 
tullman  our chairman and chief executive officer  are integral to the execution of our business strategy 
if one or more of our key employees leaves our employment  we will have to find a replacement with the combination of skills and attributes necessary to execute our strategy 
because competition for skilled employees is intense  and the process of finding qualified individuals can be lengthy and expensive  we believe that the loss of the services of key personnel could negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we are unable to implement our acquisition strategy successfully  our ability to expand our product and service offerings and our customer base may be limited 
we regularly evaluate acquisition opportunities 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  services  products and personnel of the acquired company  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  entry into markets in which we have little or no direct prior experience  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company and our inability to maintain the goodwill of the acquired businesses 
in order to expand our product and service offerings and grow our business by reaching new customers  we may continue to acquire businesses that we believe are complementary 
the successful implementation of this strategy depends on our ability to identify suitable acquisition candidates  acquire companies on acceptable terms  integrate their operations and technology successfully with our own and maintain the goodwill of the acquired business 
we are unable to predict whether or when any prospective acquisition candidate will become available or the likelihood that any acquisition will be completed 
moreover  in pursuing acquisition opportunities  we may compete for acquisition targets with other companies with similar growth strategies 
some of these competitors may be larger and have greater financial and other resources than we have 
competition for these acquisition targets could also result in increased prices of acquisition targets 
future acquisitions may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  the incurrence of additional debt  the assumption of known and unknown liabilities  the write off of software development costs and the amortization of expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  all of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  operating results and prospects 
we have taken  and  if an impairment occurs  could take  charges against earnings in connection with acquisitions 
the costs and expenses incurred may exceed the estimates upon which we based these charges 
our business depends on our intellectual property rights  and if we are unable to protect them  our competitive position may suffer 
our business plan is predicated on our proprietary systems and technology  including touchworks and physician education products 
we protect our proprietary rights through a combination of trademark  trade secret and copyright law  confidentiality agreements and technical measures 
we generally enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees and consultants and limit access to our trade secrets and technology 
we cannot assure you that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation of technology 
misappropriation of our intellectual property would have a material adverse effect on our competitive position 
in addition  we may have to engage in litigation in the future to enforce or protect our intellectual property rights or to defend against claims of invalidity  and we may incur substantial costs as a result 
if we are deemed to infringe on the proprietary rights of third parties  we could incur unanticipated expense and be prevented from providing our products and services 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and the functionality of our applications overlaps with competitive products 
while we do not believe that we have infringed or are infringing on any valid proprietary rights of third parties  we cannot assure you that infringement claims will not be asserted against us or that those claims will be unsuccessful 
we could incur substantial costs and diversion of management resources defending any infringement claims 
furthermore  a party making a claim against us could secure a judgment awarding substantial damages  as well as injunctive or other equitable relief that could effectively block our ability to provide products or services 
in addition  we cannot assure you that licenses for any intellectual property of third parties that might be required for our products or services will be available on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
factors beyond our control could cause interruptions in our operations  which would adversely affect our reputation in the marketplace and our results of operations 
to succeed  we must be able to operate our systems without interruption 
certain of our communications and information services are provided through our service providers 
our operations are vulnerable to interruption by damage from a variety of sources  many of which are not within our control  including power loss and telecommunications failures  software and hardware errors  failures or crashes  computer viruses and similar disruptive problems  and fire  flood and other natural disasters 
any significant interruptions in our services would damage our reputation in the marketplace and have a negative impact on our results of operations 
we may be liable for use of data we provide 
we provide data for use by healthcare providers in treating patients 
third party contractors provide us with most of this data 
although no claims have been brought against us alleging injuries related to the use of our data  claims may be made in the future 
while we maintain product liability insurance coverage in an amount that we believe is sufficient for our business  we cannot assure you that this coverage will prove to be adequate or will continue to be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
a claim brought against us that is uninsured or under insured could materially harm our financial condition 
if our security is breached  we could be subject to liability  and customers could be deterred from using our services 
the difficulty of securely transmitting confidential information over the internet has been a significant barrier to conducting e commerce and engaging in sensitive communications over the internet 
our strategy relies on the use of the internet to transmit confidential information 
we believe that any well publicized compromise of internet security may deter people from using the internet for these purposes  and from using our system to conduct transactions that involve transmitting confidential healthcare information 
it is also possible that third parties could penetrate our network security or otherwise misappropriate patient information and other data 
if this happens  our operations could be interrupted  and we could be subject to liability 
we may have to devote significant financial and other resources to protect against security breaches or to alleviate problems caused by breaches 
we could face financial loss  litigation and other liabilities to the extent that our activities or the activities of third party contractors involve the storage and transmission of confidential information like patient records or credit information 
in addition  we could incur additional expenses to comply with the hipaa transaction standards  security standards and privacy standards  all discussed above  and to ensure that our products and services are capable of being utilized by those of our customers that are covered entities in a manner that is compliant 
if we are unable to obtain additional financing for our future needs  our growth prospects and our ability to respond to competitive pressures may be impaired 
we cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate financing is not available or is not available on acceptable terms  our ability to fund our expansion  take advantage of potential acquisition opportunities  develop or enhance services or products  or respond to competitive pressures would be significantly limited 
if our content and service providers fail to perform adequately  our reputation in the marketplace and results of operations could be adversely affected 
we depend on independent content and service providers for many of the benefits we provide through our touchworks system and our physician education applications and services  including the maintenance of managed care pharmacy guidelines  drug interaction reviews and the routing of transaction data to third party payers 
any problems with our providers that result in interruptions of our services or a failure of our services to function as desired could damage our reputation in the marketplace and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may have no means of replacing content or services on a timely basis or at all if they are inadequate or in the event of a service interruption or failure 
we also expect to rely on independent content providers for the majority of the clinical  educational and other healthcare information that we plan to provide 
in addition  we will depend on our content providers to deliver high quality content from reliable sources and to continually upgrade their content in response to demand and evolving healthcare industry trends 
any failure by these parties to develop and maintain high quality  attractive content could impair the value of our brand and our results of operations 
if third party payers force us to reduce our prices  our results of operations could suffer 
we expect to derive a significant portion of our revenue from sales  including sales over the internet  of prepackaged medications to physicians 
we may be subject to pricing pressures with respect to our future sales of prepackaged medications arising from various sources  including practices of managed care organizations and any governmental action requiring or allowing pharmaceutical reimbursement under medicare 
if our pricing of prepackaged medications experiences significant downward pressure  our business will be less profitable 
if we incur costs exceeding our insurance coverage in lawsuits pending against us or that are brought against us in the future  it could materially adversely affect our financial condition 
we are a defendant in numerous multi defendant lawsuits involving the manufacture and sale of dexfenfluramine  fenfluramine and phentermine 
in the event we are found liable in any lawsuits filed against us  and if our insurance coverage were inadequate to satisfy these liabilities  it could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition 
see legal proceedings 
if our principal supplier fails or is unable to perform its contract with us  we may be unable to meet our commitments to our customers 
we currently purchase a majority of the medications that we repackage from amerisourcebergen 
if we do not meet certain minimum purchasing requirements  amerisourcebergen may increase the prices that we pay under this agreement  in which case we would have the option to terminate the agreement 
although we believe that there are a number of other sources of supply of medications  if amerisourcebergen fails or is unable to perform under our agreement  particularly at certain critical times during the year  we may be unable to meet our commitments to our customers  and our relationships with our customers could suffer 
because of anti takeover provisions under delaware law and in our certificate of incorporation and by laws  takeovers may be more difficult  possibly preventing you from obtaining optimal share price 
certain provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could have the effect of making it more difficult for a third party to acquire  or of discouraging a third party from attempting to acquire  control of us 
for example  our certificate of incorporation and by laws provide for a classified board of directors and allow us to issue preferred stock with rights senior to those of the common stock without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
in addition  we are subject to the anti takeover provisions of section of the delaware general corporation law  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of us 
risks related to our industry if the healthcare environment becomes more restrictive  or we do not comply with healthcare regulations  our existing and future operations may be curtailed  and we could be subject to liability 
as a participant in the healthcare industry  our operations and relationships are regulated by a number of federal  state and local governmental entities 
because our business relationships with physicians are unique  and the healthcare electronic commerce industry as a whole is relatively young  the application of many state and federal regulations to our business operations is uncertain 
it is possible that a review of our business practices or those of our customers by courts or regulatory authorities could result in a determination that could adversely affect us 
in addition  the healthcare regulatory environment may change in a way that restricts our existing operations or our growth 
electronic prescribing 
the use of our touchworks software by physicians to perform electronic prescribing  electronic routing of prescriptions to pharmacies and dispensing is governed by state and federal law 
the application of these laws to our business is uncertain because many existing laws and regulations  when enacted  did not anticipate methods of e commerce now being developed 
the laws of many jurisdictions neither specifically permit nor specifically prohibit electronic transmission of prescription orders 
future regulation of these areas may adversely affect us 
licensure 
as a repackager and distributor of drugs  we are subject to regulation by and licensure with the united states food and drug administration  the united states drug enforcement administration and various state agencies that regulate wholesalers or distributors 
among the regulations applicable to our repackaging operation are the fda s good manufacturing practice regulations 
because the fda s good manufacturing practice regulations were designed to govern the manufacture  rather than the repackaging  of drugs  we face legal uncertainty concerning the application of some aspects of these regulations and of the standards that the fda will enforce 
both the fda and the dea have the right  at any time  to inspect our facilities and operations to determine if we are operating in compliance with the requirements for licensure and all applicable laws and regulations 
in august of  we received an fda warning letter  like many other drug repackagers  alleging violations of fda regulations  including the good manufacturing practice regulations 
we subsequently implemented procedures intended to address many of the concerns raised by the fda in that letter and believe that our compliance with fda regulations meets or exceeds the standard in the drug repackaging industry 
we were subsequently inspected in august and had no warning letter issued as a result of that inspection 
we also believe that we possess all licenses required to operate our business 
if  however  we do not maintain all necessary licenses  or the fda decides to substantially modify the manner in which it has historically enforced its good manufacturing practice regulations against drug repackagers or the fda or dea finds any violations during one of their periodic inspections  we could be subject to liability  and our operations could be shut down 
physician dispensing 
physician dispensing of medications for profit is allowed in all states except utah and is prohibited  subject to extremely limited exceptions  in massachusetts  montana and texas 
in addition  new jersey and new york allow physician dispensing of medications for profit  but limit the number of days supply of all medications  subject to limited exceptions  that a physician may dispense  several other states limit the number of days supply of controlled substances that a physician may dispense 
other states may enact legislation or regulations prohibiting or restricting physician dispensing 
the american medical association  through certain of its constituent bodies  has historically taken inconsistent positions on physician dispensing  alternately discouraging and supporting it 
while the ama s council on ethical and judicial affairs in discouraged physicians from regularly dispensing prescription pharmaceuticals  in the ama s house of delegates adopted the following resolution resolved  that the american medical association support the physician s right to dispense drugs and devices when it is in the best interest of the patient and consistent with the ama s ethical guidelines 
this position was reaffirmed by the ama house of delegates in january the ama s ethical guidelines provide in relevant part that physicians may dispense drugs within their office practices provided there is no resulting exploitation of patients 
while two recent reports of the council on ethical and judicial affairs oppose the in office sale of health related products by physicians  these reports specifically exclude the sale of prescription items from their scope  although they do refer to the council s report 
stark ii 
congress enacted significant prohibitions against physician self referrals in the omnibus budget reconciliation act of this law  commonly referred to as stark ii  applies to physician dispensing of outpatient prescription drugs that are reimbursable by medicare or medicaid 
we believe that the physicians who use our touchworks system or dispense drugs distributed by us are aware of these requirements  since they are generally well known in the health care industry  but we do not monitor our customers compliance and have no assurance that our customers are using our touchworks system or dispensing drugs in material compliance with stark ii  either pursuant to an in office ancillary services exception or another applicable exception 
while our physician customers currently do not  to any significant degree  dispense drugs that are reimbursable by medicare or medicaid  if they were to and if it were determined that the physicians who use our system or dispense pharmaceuticals purchased from us were not in compliance with stark ii  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and prospects 
drug distribution 
as a distributor of prescription drugs to physicians  we and our customers are also subject to the federal anti kickback statute  which applies to medicare  medicaid and other state and federal programs 
the statute prohibits the solicitation  offer  payment or receipt of remuneration in return for referrals or the purchase  or in return for recommending or arranging for the referral or purchase of goods  including drugs  covered by the programs 
the anti kickback law provides a number of exceptions or safe harbors for particular types of transactions 
we believe that our arrangements with our customers are in material compliance with the anti kickback statute and relevant safe harbors 
many states have similar fraud and abuse laws  and we believe that we are in material compliance with those laws 
if  however  it were determined that we were not in compliance with those laws  we could be subject to liability  and our operations could be curtailed 
claims transmission 
as part of our services provided to physicians  our system will electronically transmit claims for prescription medications dispensed by a physician to many patients managed care organizations and payers for immediate approval and reimbursement 
federal law provides that it is both a civil and a criminal violation for any person to submit a claim to any payer  including  for example  medicare  medicaid and all private health plans or managed care plans seeking payment for any services or products that have not been provided to the patient or overbilling for services or products provided 
we have in place policies and procedures that we believe assure that all claims that are transmitted by our system are accurate and complete  provided that the information given to us by our customer is also accurate and complete 
if  however  we do not follow those procedures and policies  or they are not sufficient to prevent inaccurate claims from being submitted  we could be subject to liability 
the hipaa transaction standards and the hipaa security standards will also have a potentially significant effect on our claims transmission services  since those services must be structured and provided in a way that supports our customers hipaa compliance obligations 
patient information 
existing federal and state laws and regulations regulate the disclosure of confidential medical information  including information regarding conditions like aids  substance abuse and mental illness 
the privacy standards grant a number of rights to individuals as to their protected health information and restrict the use and disclosure of protected health information by covered entities  such as our customers 
in addition  those of our customers that are covered entities must have in place a written business associate agreement with us  containing specified satisfactory assurances that we will safeguard protected health information that it creates or accesses and fulfil other obligations to support the covered entity s own compliance obligations 
we believe that the principal effects of hipaa on us will be  first  to require that our services and systems be capable of being operated by our customers in a manner that is compliant with hipaa and  second  to require us to enter into and comply with business associate agreements with our customers 
the business associate agreements impose new and additional obligations on us in our operations 
the privacy rule and its interpretation are subject to change from time to time 
in the event that the privacy rule is interpreted in a way that requires material change to the way in which we do business  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and prospects 
as part of the operation of our business  our customers do provide to us patient identifiable medical information related to the prescription drugs that they prescribe and other aspects of patient treatment 
we have policies and procedures that we believe assure compliance with all federal and state confidentiality requirements for handling of protected health information that we receive and with our obligations under business associate agreements 
if  however  we do not follow those procedures and policies  or they are not sufficient to prevent the unauthorized disclosure of confidential medical information  we could be subject to liability  fines and lawsuits  termination of our customer contracts  or our operations could be shut down 
the bush administration has announced that it intends to propose broad medicare reform legislation that would make available to medicare recipients a subsidized prescription drug benefit 
while no federal price controls are included in the current version of the proposed legislation  any legislation that reduces physician incentives to dispense medications in their offices could adversely affect physician acceptance of our products 
we cannot predict whether or when future health care reform initiatives at the federal or state level or other initiatives affecting our business will be proposed  enacted or implemented or what impact those initiatives may have on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
if the rapidly evolving electronic healthcare information market fails to develop as quickly as expected  our business prospects will be impaired 
the electronic healthcare information market is in the early stages of development and is rapidly evolving 
a number of market entrants have introduced or developed products and services that are competitive with one or more components of the solutions we offer 
we expect that additional companies will continue to enter this market 
in new and rapidly evolving industries  there is significant uncertainty and risk as to the demand for  and market acceptance of  recently introduced products and services 
because the markets for our products and services are new and evolving  we are not able to predict the size and growth rate of the markets with any certainty 
we cannot assure you that markets for our products and services will develop or that  if they do  they will be strong and continue to grow at a sufficient pace 
if markets fail to develop  develop more slowly than expected or become saturated with competitors  our business prospects will be impaired 
consolidation in the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business 
many healthcare industry participants are consolidating to create integrated healthcare delivery systems with greater market power 
as provider networks and managed care organizations consolidate  competition to provide products and services like ours will become more intense  and the importance of establishing relationships with key industry participants will become greater 
these industry participants may try to use their market power to negotiate price reductions for our products and services 
if we were forced to reduce our prices  our business would become less profitable unless we were able to achieve corresponding reductions in our expenses 
risks related to our stock the public market for our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
the market price of our common stock is highly volatile and could fluctuate significantly in response to various factors  including actual or anticipated variations in our quarterly operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new services or products by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts  conditions and trends in the electronic healthcare information  internet  e commerce and pharmaceutical markets  and general market conditions and other factors 
in addition  the stock markets  especially the nasdaq national market  have experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market prices of equity securities of many technology companies  and internet related companies in particular 
these fluctuations have often been unrelated or disproportionate to operating performance 
these broad market factors may materially affect the trading price of our common stock 
general economic  political and market conditions like recessions and interest rate fluctuations may also have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
volatility in the market price for our common stock may result in the filing of securities class action litigation 
our quarterly operating results may vary 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past  and we expect that our quarterly operating results will continue to vary in future periods depending on a number of factors  including seasonal variances in demand for our products and services  the sales  service and implementation cycles for our touchworks system and physician education products and services and other factors described in this risk factors section of this report 
for example  all other factors aside  sales of our prepackaged medications have historically been highest in the fall and winter months 
we base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenue  and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we have lower revenue  we may not be able to reduce our spending in the short term in response 
any shortfall in revenue would have a direct impact on our results of operations 
for these and other reasons  we may not meet the earnings estimates of securities analysts or investors  and our stock price could suffer 
we may have substantial sales of our common stock that could cause our stock price to fall 
our common stock began trading on the nasdaq national market on july   however  there have been a limited number of shares trading in the public market 
a substantial number of our shares have and will continue to become eligible for public sale  and sales of a substantial number of shares of our common stock could cause our stock price to fall 
because our executive officers and directors have substantial control of our voting stock  takeovers not supported by them will be more difficult  possibly preventing you from obtaining optimal share price 
the control of a significant amount of our stock by insiders could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our executive officers and directors beneficially own or control  shares or of the outstanding common stock as of february  if our executive officers and directors choose to act or vote together  they will have the power to influence significantly all matters requiring the approval of our stockholders  including the election of directors and the approval of significant corporate transactions 
without the consent of these stockholders  we could be prevented from entering into transactions that could be beneficial to us
