item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment stifel financial corp 
the parent  through its wholly owned subsidiaries  principally stifel  nicolaus company  incorporated stifel nicolaus  collectively referred to as the company  is principally engaged in retail brokerage  securities trading  investment banking  investment advisory  and related financial services throughout the united states 
although the company has offices throughout the united states  its major geographic area of concentration is in the midwest and  to a lesser extent  the rocky mountain region 
the company s principal customers are individual investors  with the remaining client base composed of corporations  municipalities  and institutions 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is derived from commissions  investment banking fees  principal transactions  and margin interest revenue 
changes in economic conditions  inflation  volatility of securities prices and interest rates  trading volume of securities  demand for investment banking services  geopolitical events  and competition from other securities brokerage firms and financial institutions are outside the control of the company and may negatively impact these sources of revenue 
since a significant portion of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  and revenues are subject to volatility  results of operations can vary significantly from period to period 
the company faces increasing competition from other financial institutions  such as commercial banks  online service providers  and other companies offering financial services 
the financial modernization act  signed into law in late  lifted restrictions on banks and insurance companies  permitting them to provide financial services once dominated by securities firms 
in addition  recent consolidation in the financial services industry may lead to increased competition from larger  more diversified organizations 
at present  the company is unable to predict the extent of these changes and their impact on the company s results of operations 
the company s business activities subject it to substantial risks of potential liability to customers and to regulatory enforcement proceedings 
participants in the securities industry face an increasing amount of litigation and arbitration proceedings 
dissatisfied clients regularly make claims against securities firms and their investment executives for fraud  unauthorized trading  suitability  churning  failure to supervise  and breach of fiduciary duty 
underwriters and selling agents may be liable if they make material misstatements or omit material information in prospectuses and other communications regarding underwritten offerings of securities 
the company may be adversely affected by claims of this nature filed against it currently or in the future 
the cost of attracting and retaining skilled professionals in the financial services industry has escalated considerably as competition for these professionals has intensified 
employers in the industry are increasingly offering transition pay in the form of guaranteed contracts  upfront payments  and increased compensation 
since late  the company has increased the number of its investment executives and institutional sales people from to as part of its overall growth strategy 
in order to attract these investment executives  the company offered transition pay  principally in the form of upfront loans 
these loans are amortized over a five to ten year period 
during a period of declining markets  the company may be adversely affected  as a portion of these costs remain fixed 
the difficult market and economic conditions that existed in deteriorated even further in despite fairly resilient consumer spending  stimulated by historically low interest rates that lowered borrowing costs and increased home mortgage refinancings  economic growth remained sluggish 
concerns over weak corporate earnings  significant corporate bankruptcies  corporate governance scandals  heightened geopolitical tensions in the middle east  the war on terrorism  and the threat of war with iraq served to dissuade the investor further from the market 
the equity markets posted losses for the third consecutive year  with all three major equity market indices posting double digit losses 
the combination of a weak economy  a declining stock market  and heightened geopolitical concerns resulted in another challenging year for the securities industry 
stock issuance volumes declined  reflecting falling stock prices and lack of investor demand 
merger and acquisition volumes dropped dramatically during  reflecting unstable equity market conditions 
stifel financial corp 
and subsidiaries business environment continued as a result of the federal reserve board s lowering of the fed funds interest rates eleven times during and once during the last quarter of  the company s rates charged to its customers for borrowings were reduced 
likewise  the interest rates paid by the company to support customer and firm borrowings declined 
the effect of the reduction in interest rates  along with the company s issuance of preferred securities see note l  was to reduce the company s net interest margin by million 
however  for and  the economic and interest rate environment provided favorable conditions industry wide for municipal bond underwritings  as state and local governments tapped the capital markets to fund growing budget deficits and to refinance higher interest debt at very low borrowing costs 
despite the uncertainty in the market  the company continued its expansion efforts  albeit somewhat subdued from the prior years  by opening branch offices  for a total of in states  and increasing the number of investment executives to from critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements and related disclosures in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions  and estimates that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
note a to the consolidated financial statements in the annual report on form k for the year ended december   describes the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates are used for  but not limited to  the accounting for the fair value of non marketable investments and contingencies 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the following critical accounting policies are impacted significantly by judgments  assumptions  and estimates used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
legal reserves the company records reserves related to legal proceedings resulting from lawsuits and arbitrations  which arise from its business activities 
some of these lawsuits and arbitrations claim substantial amounts  including punitive damage claims 
management has determined that it is likely that ultimate resolution in favor of the claimant will result in losses to the company on certain of these claims 
the company has  after consultation with outside legal counsel and consideration of facts currently known by management  recorded estimated losses to the extent they believe certain claims are probable of loss and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
factors considered by management in estimating the company s liability are the loss and damages sought by the claimant plaintiff  the merits of the claim  the amount of loss in the client s account  the possibility of wrongdoing on the part of the employee of the company  the total cost of defending the litigation and the likelihood of a successful defense against the claim  and the potential for fines and penalties from regulatory agencies 
results of litigation and arbitration are inherently uncertain  and management s assessment of risk associated therewith is subject to change as the proceedings evolve 
after discussion with outside counsel  management  based on its understanding of the facts  reasonably estimates a range of loss and accrues what they consider appropriate to reserve against probable loss for certain claims  which is included in the balance sheet under the caption accounts payable and accrued expenses 
valuation of securities and investments securities not readily marketable  held for investment by the parent and certain subsidiaries  of million and million at december  and  respectively  are included under the caption investments and are carried at fair value 
investment securities of registered broker dealer subsidiaries are carried at fair value or amounts that approximate fair value 
the fair value of investments  for which a quoted market or dealer price is not available  are based on management s estimates 
among the factors considered by management in determining the fair value of investments are the cost of the investment  terms and liquidity  developments since the acquisition of the investment  the sales price of recently issued securities  the financial condition and operating results of the issuer  earnings trends and consistency of operating cash flows  the long term business potential of the issuer  the quoted market price of securities with similar quality and yield that are publicly traded  and other factors generally pertinent to the valuation of investments 
the fair value of these investments is subject to a high degree of volatility and may be susceptible to significant fluctuation in the near term
