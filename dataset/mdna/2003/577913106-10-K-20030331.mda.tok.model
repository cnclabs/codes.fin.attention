deconsolidation of kaiser under generally accepted accounting principles  consolidation is generall y required for investments of more than of the outstanding voting stock of an investee  except when control is not held by the majority owner 
under these rules  legal reorganization or bankruptcy represent conditions which can preclude consolidation in instances where control rests with the bankruptcy court  rather than the majority owner 
as a result of kaiser s filing for bankruptcy as discussed in note  kaiser s financial results were deconsolidated beginning february   and the company began reporting its investment in kaiser using the cost method  under which the investment is reflected as a single amount on the company s balance sheet of million and the recording of earnings or losses from kaiser was discontinued after february  since kaiser s results are no longer consolidated and the company believes that it is not probable that it will be obligated to fund losses related to its investment in kaiser  any adjustments reflected in kaiser s financial statements subsequent to february  relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities or the effects on existing stockholders deficit as well as adjustments made to kaiser s financial information for loss contingencies and other matters  are not expected to affect the company s financial results

the company s forest products operations are conducted by mgi  through pacific lumber  scotia llc and britt 
the segment s business is somewhat seasonal  and its net sales have been historically higher in the months of apri l through november than in the months of december through march 
management expects that mgi s revenues and cash flows will continue to be somewhat seasonal 
accordingly  mgi s results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of results to be expected for the full year 
regulatory and environmental matters play a significant role in the company s forest products operations 
see item business forest products operations regulatory and environmental matters and note for a discussion of these matters 
regulatory compliance and related litigation have caused delays in obtaining approvals of thps and delays in harvesting on thps once the y are approved 
this has resulted in a decline in harvest  an increase in the cos t of logging operations  and lower net sales  as well as increased costs related to timber harvest litigation 
since the consummation of the headwaters agreement in march  there has been a significant amount of work required in connection with the implementation of the environmental plans  and this work is expected to continu e for several more years 
in and  this caused delays in obtaining approvals of thps 
the rate of approvals of thps during improved over that for the prior year  and further improvements were experienced in as discussed in note  other factors may adversely impact the company s ability to meet its harvesting goals 
the north coast water board is requiring the company to apply certain waste discharge requirements to approved thps covering winter harvesting operations in the freshwater and elk river watersheds  and th e north coast water board could require the company to follow waste discharge requirements before harvesting operations are conducted on thps in other watersheds 
this requirement could cause delays in harvesting 
a stay issued in connection with the epic syp permits lawsuit requires the company to follow an alternative thp approval process for thps submitted to the cdf after mid october  resulting in delays in obtaining approvals of thps 
furthermore  there can be no assurance that certain other pending legal  regulatory and environmental matters or future governmental regulations  legislation or judicial or administrative decisions  adverse weather conditions or low lumber or log prices  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or liquidity

during  comprehensive external and internal reviews were conducted o f pacific lumber s business operations 
these reviews were conducted in an effort to identify ways in which pacific lumber could operate on a more efficient and cost effective basis 
based upon the results of these reviews  pacific lumber  among other things  closed two of its four sawmills  eliminated certain of its operations  including its soil amendment and concrete block activities  began utilizing more efficient harvesting methods and adopted certain other cost saving measures 
most of these changes were implemented by pacific lumber in th e last quarter of  or the first quarter of pacific lumber also ended its internal logging operations which historically performed approximately hal f of its logging as of march   and now relies exclusively on contract loggers 
in connection with the changes described above  pacific lumber recorde d charges to earnings of million for impaired assets  million for restructuring initiatives  and million for environmental remediation costs during see note 
further actions may be taken during the next year as a result of pacific lumber s continuing evaluation process  and additional writedowns of certain assets may be required 
in may  the company completed the first timber cruise on its timberlands since the results of the timber cruise provided the company with an estimate of the volume of merchantable timber on the company s timberlands 
the new cruise data reflected a million mbf decrease in estimated overall timber volume as compared to the estimated volumes reported a s of december   using the cruise data adjusted for harvest and estimated growth 
the new cruise data indicates that there is significantly less old growth timber than estimated as of december   using the cruise data 
there was also an estimated increase in young growth timber volume almost equal to the estimated decrease in old growth timber volume 
this change in mix could adversely affect the company s revenues 
however  because there ar e many variables that affect revenues and profitability  the company cannot quantify the effect of the revised estimate on current and future cash flows 
the new timber volumes are now being utilized in various aspects of the company s operations  including estimating volumes on thps and determining depletion expense

results of operations between quarterly periods are generally not comparable due to the timing  varying lengths and types of racing meets held 
historically  sam houston race park has derived a significant amount of its annual net pari mutuel commissions from live racing and simulcasting 
net pari mutuel commissions have typically been highest during the first and fourth quarters of the year  the time during which sam houston race park has historically conducted live thoroughbred racing 
live greyhound racing also contributes to higher net pari mutuel commissions in the first and fourth quarters of the year

other items not directly related to industry segments years ended december  in millions operating loss loss before income taxes operating loss the operating losses represent corporate general and administrative expenses that are not attributable to the company s industry segments 
the increase in the operating loss in versus was primarily due to costs incurred in connection with the kaiser bankruptcy see note  in addition to severance and moving expenses incurred as a result of reduction in corporate staff and office space 
the decrease in the operating loss between and was due to accruals for certain legal contingencies  which were million an d million in and  respectively see note 
loss before income taxes the loss before income taxes includes operating losses  investment  interest and other income expense and interest expense  including amortizatio n of deferred financing costs  that are not attributable to the company s industr y segments

net sales net sales for decreased as compared to primarily due to decreases in average realized prices for bauxite and alumina  primary aluminum  flat rolled products and engineered products  in addition to decreases in shipments of primary aluminum and flat rolled products 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in third party shipments of bauxite and alumina  in addition to increased shipments of engineered products 
the decrease in average realized prices for alumina was due to a decrease in primary aluminum market prices to which kaiser s third party alumina sales contracts are linked 
the decrease in shipments of primary aluminum was due to the curtailment of certain operations with respect to kaiser s interest in an aluminum smelter in ghana during  as well as the curtailment of certain operations at kaiser s tacoma  washington  facility during the decrease in shipments of flat rolled products was primarily due to continued soft aerospace products demand  in addition to exits from the can lid  tab stock and brazing sheet product lines 
the decrease in average realized prices for engineered products was due to weak overall market conditions  although shipments of engineered products increased slightly due to increased demand in the ground transportatio n market 
net sales for the year ended december   decreased from the year ago period primarily due to a decrease in average realized prices for alumina and primary aluminum as well as a decline in shipments of primary aluminum  flat rolled products and engineered products 
these decreases in prices and shipments were partially offset by an increase in net shipments of bauxite and alumina as well as an increase in average realized prices for flat rolled and engineered products 
the decrease in average realized prices for alumina was du e to a decrease in primary aluminum market prices to which kaiser s third party alumina sales contracts are linked 
the decrease in shipments of primary aluminum was primarily due to the complete curtailment of the northwest smelter s during the decrease in shipments of flat rolled products was primarily due to reduced shipments of can body stock as a part of the planned exit from this product line 
shipments for flat rolled products were also adversely affected by reduced general engineering heat treat products and can lid and tab stock due to weak market demand 
these decreases were only modestly offset by a strong aerospace demand during the first nine months of however  after th e events of september   aerospace demand and the price for aerospace products declined substantially 
the decrease in engineered products shipments was the result of reduced transportation and electrical product shipments due t o weak us market demand

these items are described further in note in addition to the decrease in average realized prices and shipments discussed above  operating income for was adversely affected by abnormal gramercy related start up costs and litigation costs  overhead and other fixed costs associated with the curtailed northwest smelting operations  and increased costs due to a lag in the ability to scale back costs to reflect a revised product mix and the substantial volume decline caused by weakened demand 
income loss before income taxes and minority interests kaiser experienced a loss before income taxes and minority interests in as compared to income before income taxes and minority interests in in addition to the non recurring operating items discussed above  results for included million of non recurring items primarily consisting of gain s on sales of real estate and miscellaneous equipment compared to non recurring charges of million in described further in note the primary reason for the decline is the decrease in operating results discussed above 
in addition  kaiser incurred reorganization expenses of million as a resul t of the cases during  which also contributed to the decline 
results for included a million gain on the sale of an interest in qal 
the impact of these items was offset in part by a decline in interest expense of million as a result of interest being deferred during bankruptcy

the master purchase agreement provides that if the purchase price equal s or exceeds the sbe price and a structuring price set forth in a schedule to the timber notes indenture  the purchase price is deemed to be at fair market value 
sbe price is the applicable stumpage price for each species of timber and category thereof pursuant to a schedule published periodically by the california state board of equalization harvest value schedule 
if the purchase price equals or exceeds the sbe price  but is less than the structurin g price  then scotia llc is required to engage an independent forestry consultant to confirm that the purchase price reflects fair market value 
in june  the state board of equalization adopted the new harvest value schedule for the second half of  which reflected an approximate decline for small redwood logs and no price change for small douglas fir logs 
this decline in sbe prices had an adverse impact on scotia llc s net sales and liquidity during the second half of in january  scotia llc engaged a consultant with respect to establishing the purchase prices of logs to be sold to pacific lumber in the first half of the consultant determined that with respect to certain categories of logs  the fair market value was higher than the comparable sbe price 
the resulting prices for redwood logs will on average be approximately higher for the first half of than those for the second half of there will be relatively no price change for douglas fir 
with respect to short term liquidity  scotia llc believes that existing cash available for principal payments from the sar account  and funds available under the scotia llc line of credit  together with cash flows from operations  should provide sufficient funds to meet its working capital  capital expenditures and required debt service obligations through with respect t o long term liquidity  although the company expects that cash flows from operations and funds available under the sar account and the scotia llc line of credit should be adequate to meet scotia llc s debt service  working capital an d capital expenditure requirements  unless log prices continue to improve there can be no assurance that this will be the case 
in addition  cash flows from operations may continue to be adversely affected if harvest levels decline as a result of the factors discussed in results of operations forest products operations industry overview and selected operational data above and note with respect to long term liquidity  although mgi and its subsidiaries expect that their existing cash and cash equivalents  lines of credit and ability to generate cash flows from operations should provide sufficient funds to meet their debt service  working capital and capital expenditure requirements  until such time as pacific lumber has adequate cash flows from operations and or dividends from scotia llc  there can be no assurance that thi s will be the case 
cash flows from operations in the long term may continue to b e adversely affected by the same factors discussed above which are affecting short term cash flows from operations

critical accounting policies this section contains statements which constitute forward looking statements within the meaning of the pslra 
see item business general an d below for cautionary information with respect to such forward looking statements 
the discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations is based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
the result of this process forms the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that ar e not readily apparent from other sources 
the company re evaluates its estimates and judgments on a regular  ongoing basis 
actual results may differ from these estimates due to changed circumstances and conditions 
the following accounting policies are considered critical in light of the potentially material impact that the estimates  judgments and uncertainties affecting the application of these policies might have on the company s reporte d financial information 
principles of consolidation deconsolidation of kaiser under generally accepted accounting principles  consolidation is generall y required for investments of more than of the outstanding voting stock of an investee  except when control is not held by the majority owner 
under these principles  legal reorganization or bankruptcy represent conditions which can preclude consolidation in instances where control rests with the bankruptcy court  rather than the majority owner 
as discussed above  on february  kaiser and certain of its subsidiaries filed for reorganization under chapter of the code 
as a result  the company deconsolidated kaiser s financial results beginning february   and began reporting its investment in kaiser using the cost method 
through february   under generally accepted principles of consolidation  the company had recognized losses in excess of its investment in kaiser of million 
since kaiser s results are no longer consolidated and the company believes that it is not probable that it will be obligated to fund losses related to its investment in kaiser  any adjustments reflected in kaiser s financial statements subsequent to february  relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts and classification of liabilities or the effects on existing stockholders deficit as well as adjustments made to kaiser s financial information for loss contingencies and other matters  are not expected to affect the company s financial results 
as previously disclosed in its audited consolidated financial statements for december   the company expected it would reverse its losses in excess of its investment in kaiser on february  and would recognize amounts previously reported as other comprehensive income a component of stockholders deficit in its consolidated statement of operations upon deconsolidation 
however  subsequent to filing the form k  the company determined that it should not reverse the losses or recognize in earnings the other comprehensive losses related to kaiser at the time deconsolidation occurred 
the company expects it will consider reversal of these losses when either kaiser s bankruptcy is resolved and the amount of the company s remaining investment in kaiser is determined or the company disposes of the kaiser shares 
accordingly  these consolidated financial statements do not reflect any adjustments related to the deconsolidation of kaiser other than presenting the company s investment in kaiser using the cost method  which reflects the investment as a single amount on its balance sheet  and discontinuing the recording of earnings or losses from kaiser after february when either of the events described above occurs  the company will re evaluate the appropriate accounting treatment of its investment in kaiser based upon the facts and circumstances at such time 
no assurances can be given that the company s ownership interest in kaiser will not be significantly diluted or cancelled as a result of kaiser s plan of reorganization 
loss contingencies the company is involved in various claims  lawsuits and other proceedings discussed in note such litigation involves uncertainty as to possible losse s the company may ultimately realize when one or more future events occur or fail to occur 
the company accrues and charges to income estimated losses from contingencies when it is probable at the balance sheet date that an asset has been impaired or liability incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
differences between estimates recorded and actual amounts determined in subsequent periods are treated as changes in accounting estimates ie  the y are reflected in the financial statements in the period in which they are determined to be losses  with no retroactive restatement 
the company estimates the probability of losses on legal contingencies based on the advice of internal and external counsel  the outcomes from similar litigation  the status of the lawsuits including settlement initiatives  legislative developments  and other factors 
risks and uncertainties are inherent with respect to the ultimate outcome of litigation 
see note for further discussion of the company s material legal contingencies 
deferred tax asset valuation allowances as of december   the company had million of deferred tax assets net of million in valuation allowances and million of deferred tax liabilities 
the deferred tax assets and liabilities reported in the company s balance sheet reflect the amount of taxes that the company has prepaid or will receive a tax benefit for an asset or will have to pay in the future a liability because of temporary differences that result from differences in timing of revenue recognition or expense deductibility between generally accepted accounting principles and the internal revenue code 
accounting rules require that a deferred tax asset be reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not a likelihood of more than that some portion or all of the deferred ta x asset will not be realized 
the company considers all available evidence  both positive and negative  to determine whether a valuation allowance is needed 
th e need for a valuation allowance ultimately depends on the existence of sufficien t taxable income necessary to receive the benefit of a future deductible amount 
assessing the need for and amount of a valuation allowance for deferred tax assets requires significant judgment 
the fact that a benefit may be expected for a portion but not all of a deferred tax asset increases the judgmental complexity 
projections of future taxable income  by their very nature  require estimates and judgments about future events that  although they might conceivably be predictable  are far less certain than events that have already occurred and can be objectively measured 
uncertainties that might exist with respect to the realization of the company s deferred tax assets relate to future taxable income 
see note for further discussion of the company s valuation allowances on deferred tax assets obligations related to pension and other postretirement benefit plans estimating future benefit payments for purposes of measuring pension benefit obligations requires the company to make a number of assumptions about future experience 
these assumptions are combined with the terms of the company s plans to produce an estimate of required future benefit payments  which is discounted to reflect the time value of money 
as a result  assumption s about the covered population demographic assumptions and about the economic environment economic assumptions significantly affect pension and other postretirement benefit obligations 
the most significant demographic assumption s are expected retirement age  life expectancy  and turnover  while the key economic assumptions are the discount rate  the salary growth rate  and the expected return on plan assets 
the projected benefit obligation for the company s pension plans and the accumulated postretirement benefit obligation for the company s other postretirement benefit plans was determined using a discount rate of at december   and at december  the assumed long term rate o f compensation increase is 
the assumed long term rate of return on plan assets is 
plan assets consist principally of common stocks  us government and other fixed income obligations 
the estimated impact of a basis point decrease in the discount rate from to would increase the company s aggregate benefit obligation by approximately million  while the estimated impact of a basis point increase in the discount rate from to would decrease the company s aggregate benefit obligation by the same amount 
generally accepted accounting principles are applied to determine the expense that the company recognizes related to pension obligations  while pension plan funding is governed by tax and labor laws 
the company expects pension expense to be approximately million in  while cash contributions are expected to be million in this compared to million and million  respectively  in at december   the company had million in accrued liabilitie s related to pension benefits 
this amount consists of an accrued liability of million reflecting the cumulative excess of the amount the company has expensed over the amount the company has funded since inception of its plans  a s well as an additional minimum liability of million reflecting the excess o f the accumulated benefit obligation over the fair value of plan assets 
the increase in in the underfunded status of the company s plans is primarily due to lower investment returns and declining discount rates 
see note for further discussion of the company s obligations related t o pension and other postretirement benefit plans 
impairment of noncurrent assets the company reviews noncurrent assets for impairment when circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of such assets may not be recoverable 
impairment is indicated if the total undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from use of the assets  including the possible residual value associated with their eventual disposition  are less than the carrying amount of the assets 
assets are written down to fair value and a loss is recognized upon impairment 
fair value increases on assets previously written down for impairment losses are not recognized 
considerable judgment is exercised in the company s assessment of the nee d for an impairment write down 
indicators of impairment must be present 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s subjective judgments 
in some instances  situations might exist where impairments are the result of changes in economic conditions or other factors that develop over time  which increases the subjectivity of assumptions made 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the estimated future cash flows projected in the evaluation of long lived assets can vary within a wide range of outcomes 
a probability weighted approach is used for situations in which alternative courses of action to recover the carrying amount of long lived assets are under consideration or a range is estimated for the amount of possible future cash flows 
new accounting standards see note for a discussion of new accounting pronouncements and their potential impact on the company 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily under the scotia llc line of credit and the pacific lumber credit agreement  as well as certain other debt facilities used to finance real estate development activities 
these facilities bear interest at either the prime interest rate or libor plus a specified percentage point spread 
the scotia llc line of credit was established in conjunction with the offering of the timber notes 
the company s objective in maintaining its other variable rate borrowings is flexibility in borrowing funds and making repayments without penalties 
as of december   there were million in borrowings outstanding under all variable rate facilities 
based on the amount of borrowings outstanding under these facilities during  a change in interest rates effective from th e beginning of the year would have resulted in an increase or decrease in annual interest expense of million 
all of the company s other debt is fixed rate  and therefore  does not expose the company to the risk of higher interest payments due to changes in market interest rates 
the company does not utilize interest rate swaps or similar hedging arrangements
