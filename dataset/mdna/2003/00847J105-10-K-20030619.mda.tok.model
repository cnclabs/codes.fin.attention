item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations pioneer standard electronics  inc and its subsidiaries the company or pioneer standard was organized as an ohio corporation in while originally focused on electronic components distribution  the company grew to become a leading distributor of both electronic components and enterprise computer systems products 
in february  after a comprehensive analysis conducted by the company s board of directors and senior management  it was determined that the company s growth prospects and potential returns on investment would be greater if all the company s resources were devoted to the enterprise computer systems business 
therefore  the company decided to focus solely on that business and as part of the transformation sold substantially all of the assets and liabilities of its electronic components business and discontinued the related operations of aprisa  inc aprisa  the company s majority owned software business focused on creating software for the electronic components market 
the company  with its singular focus on the enterprise computer systems business  provides a broad range of servers  storage  software and services to resellers and corporate end user customers across a diverse set of industries

overview of fiscal fiscal has been a year of transition for pioneer standard 
the company entered fiscal with the electronics market in a severe downturn and a weak environment for information technology it spending 
the company made a decision to accelerate its long term growth by entering into a strategic transformation that would allow it to become a singularly focused enterprise computer systems business 
as a result  the electronic components business was sold 
the proceeds from the sale of ied  which are estimated to total million  have increased the company s financial flexibility and will be used to enhance the company s ability to fund the organic growth of the ongoing business  as well as  to provide the company with the financial flexibility to make acquisitions 
in addition  certain of these proceeds have been used and will continue to be used to opportunistically pay down debt 
the company s financial results for fiscal reflect the company s transition 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company reorganized its business and  in the process  recognized charges totaling approximately million  before tax 
the reorganization charges consisted primarily of the following restructuring charges of million  before tax  which are specific to the impairment of facilities and other assets that are no longer required and severance costs incurred in connection with downsizing the corporate structure  a pre tax investment impairment charge of million for the company s investment in a european electronic components distributor that no longer holds strategic value and was deemed other than temporarily impaired and  pre tax charges for the loss on retirement of debt of million  representing the premium paid and the write off of other related financing costs associated with the tender for and repurchase of approximately million of the company s senior notes in march in addition  in the first quarter of fiscal  the company recognized a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle of million  after tax  or per share  for goodwill impairment as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on april  including the reorganization charges and the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  the company reported a net loss of million  or per share  for fiscal  compared with a net loss of million in fiscal  or per share 
current economic environment the company s fiscal results  like other companies in the technology industry  were negatively affected by the continued economic downturn 
while economic conditions and it market demand remain depressed  companies in this industry have found ways to improve efficiency during the slowdown 
these actions should help strengthen profit potential upon the occurrence of a recovery in it demand 
the company s focus on aspects of the business that it could immediately impact during the current difficult economic environment  and the initiatives implemented within the past year  position pioneer standard well to capitalize on future opportunities 
critical accounting policies and estimates pioneer standard s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make significant estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
the company s most significant accounting policies relate to the sale  purchase  distribution and promotion of its products 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical to an understanding of pioneer standard s consolidated financial statements because their application places the most significant demands on management s judgment  with financial reporting results relying on estimation about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
specific risks for these critical accounting policies are described in the following paragraphs 
for all of these policies  management cautions that future events rarely develop exactly as forecast  and the best estimates routinely require adjustment 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is generally recognized upon shipment provided persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the sales price is fixed or determinable  collectibility is reasonably assured and title and risk of loss have passed to the customer 
sales are recorded net of discounts  customer sales incentives and returns 
the company monitors and tracks the amount of product returns and reduces revenue at the time of shipment for the estimated amount of future returns  based on the company s historical experience 
a portion of products sold are estimated to be returned due to reasons such as product failure and excess inventory stocked by the customer  which subject to certain terms and conditions  the company will agree to accept 
if future trends were to change significantly from those experienced in the past  incremental reductions to revenues may result based on this new experience 
a portion of the company s business involves shipments directly from its suppliers to its customers 
in these transactions  the company is responsible for negotiating price both with the supplier and customer  payment to the supplier  establishing payment terms with the customer  product returns  and has risk of loss if the customer does not make payment 
the company  acting as principal to the sale  recognizes revenue when the company is notified by the supplier that the product is shipped 
in addition  the company has certain business with select customers and suppliers that is accounted for on an agency basis in accordance with emerging issues task force eitf no 
reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
in such cases  the terms of the transactions govern revenue recognition 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
these allowances are based on both recent trends of certain customers estimated to be a greater credit risk as well as general trends of the entire customer pool 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
to mitigate this credit risk the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers 
inventories inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out basis or market  net of related reserves 
the company s inventory is constantly monitored to ensure appropriate valuation 
adjustments of inventories to lower of cost or market  if necessary  are based upon contractual provisions governing price protection  stock rotation right of return status  and technological obsolescence  as well as turnover and assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if assumptions about future demand change and or actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to inventory valuations may be required 
the company provides a reserve for obsolescence  which is calculated based on factors including an analysis of historical sales of products  the age of the inventory and return provisions provided by the distribution agreements 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
investments the company holds strategic marketable equity securities that are carried at fair value 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is deemed other than temporary 
management regularly reviews each investment security for impairment based on criteria that include the extent to which cost exceeds market value  the duration of the market decline  management s intent to hold the investment  and the financial condition of and specific prospects of the issuer 
pioneer standard also evaluates available information such as published financial reports and market research and analyzes cyclical trends within the industry segments in which the various companies operate to determine whether market declines should be considered other than temporary 
when management s intent or the financial condition of the issuer changes  or trends in the industry shift dramatically  the company considers the impairment other than temporary and records a charge to operations for the market decline 
deferred taxes the carrying value of the company s deferred tax assets is dependent upon the company s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be expensed in the period such determination was made 
the company presently records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event that the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount including valuation allowance  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination was made 
goodwill and long lived assets in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other long lived assets  significant assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets must be made  as well as the related estimated useful lives 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future as a result of changes in strategy and or market conditions  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
for further information concerning the company s calculation of impairment  see notes and in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
restructuring and other special charges the company has recorded a reserve in connection with reorganizing its ongoing business subsequent to its sale of ied 
this reserve principally includes estimates related to employee separation costs  the consolidation and impairment of facilities and other assets deemed inconsistent with continuing operations 
actual amounts could be different from those estimated 
determination of the impairment of assets is discussed above in goodwill and long lived assets 
facilities reserves are calculated using a probability weighted present value of future minimum lease payments  offset by an estimate for future sublease income provided by external brokers 
present value is calculated using a risk free treasury rate with a maturity equivalent to the lease term 
supplier programs the company receives funds from suppliers for price protection  product sales incentives and marketing and training programs  which are generally recorded  net of direct costs  as adjustments to cost of goods sold or operating expenses according to the nature of the program 
the product sales incentives are generally based on a particular quarter s sales activity and are primarily formula based 
some of these programs may extend over one or more quarterly reporting periods 
the company accrues supplier sales incentives and other supplier incentives as earned based on sales of qualifying products or as services are provided in accordance with the terms of the related program 
actual supplier sales incentives may vary based on volume or other sales achievement levels  which could result in an increase or reduction in the estimated amounts previously accrued  and can  at times  result in significant earnings fluctuations on a quarterly basis 
stock based compensation as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  the company continues to measure compensation expense for its stock based employee compensation plans using the intrinsic value method prescribed in accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  whereby the options are granted at market price  and therefore no compensation costs are recognized  and the options are not recognized in the financial statements until they are exercised 
however  the company provides pro forma disclosures of net income loss and net income loss per share as if the fair value method had been applied

a discussion of these new standards is included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company has not yet determined the impact of these accounting standards on its financial position and results of operations 
results of operations fiscal year ended march dollars in thousands consolidated net sales cost of goods sold gross margin warehouse  selling and administrative expenses restructuring charges write down of it system assets operating income net sales fiscal consolidated net sales decreased approximately million or from consolidated net sales in as a result of depressed corporate capital spending  as well as the decision to discontinue certain products and customer relationships that did not fit the company s long term strategic plan 
overall sales were impacted by customers taking advantage of price reductions and promotions offered by manufacturers  as well as taking longer to evaluate purchasing decisions and deferring additional capital investments because of the uncertain economy 
fiscal consolidated net sales decreased from primarily due to the weak us economy  manifested by a slowdown in information technology spending 
management expects sales to grow slightly in fiscal and expects the continuing business to be less cyclical  although more seasonal than the business mix prior to the divestiture of the company s electronic components business 
gross margin consolidated gross margin  as a percent of sales  decreased to for fiscal from in fiscal due to pricing pressures  product and customer mix and lower supplier sales incentives 
consolidated gross margin increased to in from in  as a result of improved product mix  coupled with a slight increase in supplier sales incentives 
management anticipates that gross margin will be comparable in fiscal operating expenses warehouse  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease resulted primarily from the elimination of goodwill amortization under sfas no 
combined with lower bad debt expense in the current year 
in addition  the effects of the restructurings announced in the fourth quarters of fiscal and fiscal and the initiatives to reduce discretionary spending contributed to the decline in operating expenses 
in fiscal  warehouse  selling and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal the decrease in operating expenses can primarily be attributed to expense reduction initiatives implemented in the fourth quarter of fiscal and in the third quarter of fiscal in order to improve operating margins in the difficult sales environment 
in addition  lower compensation and benefits due to personnel reductions and lower incentives associated with current financial performance contributed to this decline 
the overall decrease in operating expenses was slightly offset by an increase in bad debt expense needed due to two customer bankruptcies that occurred in fiscal restructuring and impairment charges in the fourth quarter of fiscal  resulting from the sale of the industrial electronics division  the company announced that it would restructure its remaining business and facilities to reduce overhead and eliminate assets that were inconsistent with the company s strategic plan and were no longer required 
as a result of this restructuring  the company recorded restructuring charges totaling million  classified in the fiscal consolidated statement of operations as restructuring charges 
the restructuring charges include million for severance  incentives and other employee benefit costs  including million accrued for payments that are to be made pursuant to certain tax gross up provisions of the restricted stock award agreements that were granted to certain officers on february   and severance and other employee benefit costs to be paid to approximately personnel  million for a vacant warehouse that represents excess capacity as a result of the sale  and million for the write down to fair value of assets that were abandoned as part of the corporate restructuring since they were inconsistent with the company s ongoing strategic plan 
the company estimates annual pre tax cost savings beginning in fiscal of approximately million  as a result of this restructuring 
these estimates of future costs and benefits are subject to change during the final execution of the restructuring plan  as actual sublease factors and benefit costs could differ from those estimated 
payments for the aforementioned obligations will be funded out of working capital 
the majority of these expenditures will be paid out in cash during fiscal  with the exception of lease payments  which could extend through in fiscal  management committed to a restructuring plan for certain corporate and enterprise computer system operations 
as a result of this action  the company recognized restructuring charges totaling approximately million  of which million is included in fiscal cost of goods sold and million is classified in the fiscal consolidated statement of operations as restructuring charges 
the restructuring charges of million relate to severance and other employee benefits that were paid to approximately personnel 
as of march   this amount had been fully paid 
in addition to costs associated with personnel reductions  the restructuring charges included provisions related to inventory valuation adjustments 
in the fourth quarter of  the company recognized a million pre tax charge for a non cash write down related to the abandonment of certain it system assets 
other income expense  interest expense and income taxes fiscal year ended march dollars in thousands other income  net investment impairment interest expense  net loss on retirement of debt effective tax rate continuing operations other income  net in primarily consisted of million of equity and dividend income earned from the company s investments in affiliates  partially offset by foreign currency exchange losses 
other income  net in consisted of million of equity and dividend income earned from the company s investments in affiliates  combined with foreign currency exchange gains and other income 
this income was partially offset by an investment write off of million combined with a million charge associated with ineffectiveness of the company s previously held interest rate swap 
other income  net in consisted of foreign currency exchange losses offset by million of equity and dividend income earned from investments in affiliates 
the investment impairment in fiscal represents a non cash charge of million to reduce the carrying value of the company s investment in eurodis electron plc eurodis to market value as of march  as a result of the company s sale of ied and subsequent change in business focus  pioneer standard s intent concerning this investment changed 
the investment no longer holds strategic value and it is not the company s intent to retain the investment for a long period of time 
therefore  the decline in market value was deemed to be other than temporary and the company recognized a charge in operations 
interest expense  net decreased million in compared with  and million in compared with as a result of reduced outstanding borrowings on the company s debt facilities 
in addition  the reduction in interest between and can be attributed to lower interest rates resulting from the accounts receivable securitization financing the company completed in october and favorable overall market interest rates 
the loss on retirement of debt of million in fiscal relates to the premium paid  as well as the disposition of other financing fees associated with the company s tender offer in march for its senior notes 
the company received valid tenders for and repurchased senior notes approximating million 
in  the million of expense relates to financing fees associated with the termination of a former credit facility 
the expense was originally classified as an extraordinary item prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the company recorded an income tax benefit from continuing operations at an effective tax rate of in compared with an income tax provision at an effective rate of in the change in rate from to was primarily the result of a reversal of deferred tax asset valuation allowances in pertaining to capital loss carryforwards and foreign deferred tax assets 
the effective tax rate for the income tax benefit for continuing operations in was and varied from due to the utilization of foreign net operating losses in discontinued operations on february   the company completed the sale of substantially all of the assets and liabilities of ied 
in addition  as of the sale date  the company announced its strategic transformation to focus solely on its enterprise computer systems business 
cash proceeds from the sale of ied are estimated to total million  subject to purchase price adjustments  of which approximately million has been collected as of march  the assets sold consisted primarily of accounts receivable and inventories and the company s shares of common stock in world peace industrial co 
ltd  wpi  an asian distributor of electronic components 
the buyer also assumed certain liabilities 
in december  pioneer standard acquired a majority interest in aprisa  an internet based start up corporation  which created customized software for the electronic components market 
as a result of the ied sale and pioneer standard s subsequent decision to become solely an enterprise computer systems business  aprisa ceased to provide strategic value to the company and the operations were discontinued 
for the year ended march   income from discontinued operations was comprised of the following dollars in thousands gain on sale of net assets transaction costs net gain on sale restructuring charges severance costs facilities asset impairment other total restructuring charges income before taxes of ied and aprisa for the year ended march  income from discontinued operations  before tax of million severance costs relate to the severance and other employee benefit costs to be paid to approximately employees previously employed by ied and not re hired by the purchaser 
facilities costs represent the present value of qualifying exit costs  offset by an estimate for future sublease income  for approximately vacated locations no longer required as a result of the sale 
the asset impairment charge represents the write down to fair value of assets that were abandoned or classified as held for sale  as a result of the disposition and discontinuance of ied and aprisa  respectively 
this write down was for assets that were not included in the ied sale transaction 
payments for the aforementioned obligations will be funded out of the proceeds from the sale and normal working capital 
the majority of these expenditures will be paid out in cash during fiscal  with the exception of lease payments  which could extend through in fiscal  management committed to a restructuring plan for certain ied operations 
as a result of this action  the company recognized restructuring charges totaling approximately million  pre tax 
the restruc turing charges consisted of approximately million for qualifying exit costs for one service center and eleven regional office facilities with leases expiring through and severance and other employee benefits to be paid to approximately personnel 
in addition  the restructuring charges included provisions related to inventory valuation adjustments of million for excess and obsolete inventory primarily associated with the company s decision  as part of the restructuring plan  to close its electronics manufacturing resources and services facility and to terminate certain supplier and customer relationships 
the majority of the severance costs were paid out by march  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle goodwill on april   the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets after an acquisition 
goodwill and other intangibles that have indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are subject to annual impairment tests 
all other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
effective april   the company discontinued amortization of its goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
under the required transitional provisions of sfas no 
 the company identified and evaluated its reporting units for impairment as of april   the first day of the company s fiscal year  using a two step process and engaged an outside valuation consultant to assist in this process 
the first step involved identifying the reporting units with carrying values  including goodwill  in excess of fair value 
the fair value of goodwill was estimated using a combination of a discounted cash flow valuation model  incorporating a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved for each reporting unit  and a market approach of guideline companies in similar transactions 
as a result of completing the first step of the process  it was determined that there was an impairment of goodwill at the date of adoption 
this was due primarily to market conditions and relatively low levels of sales 
in the second step of the process  the implied fair value of the affected reporting unit s goodwill was compared with its carrying value in order to determine the amount of impairment  that is  the amount by which the carrying amount exceeded the fair value 
as a result  the company recorded an impairment charge of million  before tax  which was recorded as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in the first quarter of fiscal and is reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended march  the goodwill impairment was comprised of million for the industrial electronics division and million for the operations of aprisa which were sold and discontinued  respectively  in the fourth quarter of fiscal as reflected in the accompanying consolidated statement of cash flows for fiscal the charge resulting from the cumulative effect of change in accounting principle did not impact cash flow 
liquidity and capital resources the company maintains a significant investment in accounts receivable and inventories 
as of march  and  accounts receivable and inventories totaled approximately and of total assets  excluding goodwill and assets of discontinued operations  respectively 
at march   cash and short term investments increased to million from million at march  and total debt decreased to million at march  from million in the prior year period 
these increases decreases are primarily the result of lower working capital needs and cash received from the sale of ied 
the net amount of cash provided by operating activities in fiscal was million  a decrease of million from cash provided by operating activities in fiscal of million 
this decrease was primarily the result of a loss from continuing operations  including cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  of million consisting of a number of non cash charges and a million charge for restructuring incurred as a result of the reorganization of continuing operations after the sale of ied 
this loss was offset by cash generated from decreases in accounts receivable and inventories primarily from lower working capital requirements due to decreased sales and improved asset utilization 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities when comparing fiscal with fiscal was the result of the weak sales environment 
in fiscal  the majority of the cash provided by operations was a result of decreases in accounts receivable and inventories 
for the year ended march   net cash provided by investing activities was million 
this cash consisted primarily of the initial proceeds of million from the sale of ied in february  slightly offset by cash used for capital expenditures of million 
for the years ended march  and  net cash used for investing activities was million and million  respectively 
this cash was used for capital expenditures of million and million in and  respectively 
in addition  the company used cash in to make an additional investment of million to maintain its equity interest in magirus ag  a german enterprise computer systems distributor 
the original magirus investment was acquired in for million 
also in fiscal  the company increased its existing investment in eurodis by approximately million 
prior to february  the company held publicly traded equity securities in eurodis and wpi as strategic investments 
the company does not currently attempt to reduce or eliminate the inherent market risks or the foreign currency risk associated with these investments 
the company s shares of wpi stock were included in the sale of ied 
the company realized a million loss on the sale of this investment  as unrealized losses that had been previously recorded in accumulated other comprehensive loss on the accompanying consolidated balance sheets were removed from shareholders equity and charged to operations 
the loss was included in the gain on sale of net assets within income from discontinued operations on the accompanying statement of operations for the year ended march  as of march   the market value of pioneer standard s investment in eurodis was million  as compared with a cost basis of approximately million 
in  as a result of the company s sale of ied and subsequent change in business focus  pioneer standard s intent concerning this investment changed 
the investment no longer holds strategic value and it is not the company s intent to retain the investment for a long period of time 
therefore  the decline in market value was deemed to be other than temporary  and the company recognized a million impairment charge to reduce the carrying value to market value 
this non cash charge is included as investment impairment in other income expense in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended march  in october  the company completed a three year accounts receivable securitization financing the asset securitization that provided for borrowings up to million  limited to certain borrowing base calculations  and was secured by certain trade accounts receivable 
under the terms of the agreement  the company transferred receivables to a wholly owned  consolidated subsidiary that in turn utilized the receivables to secure the borrowings  which were funded through a vehicle that issues commercial paper in the short term market 
the yield on the commercial paper  which is the commercial paper rate plus program fees  is considered a financing cost and included in interest expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
the company had not used this facility since april in february  the company canceled the asset securitization  based on the company s strong liquidity position and low anticipated borrowing needs 
there were no advances outstanding under the facility as of the cancellation date 
during the first nine months of fiscal  the company maintained a revolving credit agreement the revolver  with a group of commercial banks  which provided the company with the ability to borrow  on an unsecured basis  up to million  limited to certain borrowing base calculations 
this agreement was scheduled to expire in september on december   in connection with the pending sale of ied  the revolver was amended to reduce the company s ability to borrow to million  limited to certain borrowing base calculations  and accelerate the expiration date to june the company had not used this facility since april on march   the company terminated the agreement 
there were no advances outstanding under the revolver as of the termination date 
as a result of the above noted terminations  there were no outstanding financial or non financial covenants as of march  concurrent with the revolver amendment and attributable to the accelerated due date and reduction in borrowing capacity  the company expensed approximately million of deferred financing fees in the third quarter of fiscal in addition  as a result of the termination of the asset securitization and revolver in the fourth quarter  the remaining unamortized deferred financing fees of million were expensed 
these charges  totaling million  are included in interest expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended march  on april   the company entered into an unsecured  three year revolving credit agreement the revolver with a consortium of six banks 
the revolver provides the company with the ability to borrow up to million  limited to certain borrowing base calculations  and allows for increases  under certain conditions  up to million during the life of the facility 
the revolver also contains standard pricing terms and conditions for companies with similar credit ratings  including limitations on other borrowings  investment expenditures and the maintenance of certain financial ratios  such as leverage  fixed charge coverage and tangible net worth  among other restrictions 
the revolver advances bear interest at various levels over libor  and a facility fee is required  both of which are determined based on the company s leverage ratio 
the revolver does not contain a pre payment penalty 
at april   there were no outstanding borrowings under the revolver 
the company is currently exposed to interest rate risk from the various floating rate pricing mechanisms on the revolver 
prior to march  the company was exposed to interest rate risk primarily from floating rate pricing mechanisms on the revolver and the asset securitization s the facilities variable short term market interest rates 
prior to october  the interest rate exposure was managed by an interest rate swap used to fix the interest on a portion of the revolver 
this interest rate swap was terminated in october during fiscal  total interest bearing debt on the facilities decreased by million 
the decrease primarily represents the repayment of borrowings against the asset securitization with cash generated from working capital 
the lower borrowing level can be primarily attributed to lower working capital needs 
the company fully anticipates that borrowings on the revolver will increase when the company begins to expand its business and when the economy begins to recover 
in addition to the revolver  the company has approximately million principal amount of senior notes the notes due august and million of mandatorily redeemable convertible trust preferred securities 
in march  the company submitted a tender offer to purchase the notes for cash  at a price of  per  principal amount 
the company received valid tenders for and repurchased senior notes approximating million 
the premium paid  as well as the disposition of other financing fees  resulted in a charge of approximately million  which is included in the other income expense section of the accompanying consolidated statement of operations for the year ended march  in march and april  the company s wholly owned subsidiary  the pioneer standard financial trust the pioneer standard trust  issued  shares relating to million of mandatorily redeemable convertible trust preferred securities the trust preferred securities 
the sole asset of the pioneer standard trust is million aggregate principal amount of junior convertible subordinated debentures due march  the company has executed a guarantee providing a full and unconditional guarantee of the pioneer standard trust s obligations under the trust preferred securities 
a portion of the company s cash flow from operations is dedicated to servicing these aggregate obligations and is not available for other purposes 
however  the company may cause the pioneer standard trust to delay payment of these servicing obligations for consecutive quarters 
during such deferral periods  distributions  to which holders of the trust preferred securities are entitled  will compound quarterly  and the company may not declare or pay any dividends on its common shares 
the company does not currently anticipate suspending these obligations 
after march   the trust preferred securities are redeemable  at the option of the company  for a redemption price of of par reduced annually by to a minimum of per trust preferred security 
the trust preferred securities are subject to mandatory redemption on march   at a redemption price of per trust preferred security 
in june   shares of the trust preferred securities were converted at an exercise price of increasing equity by million 
subsequent to march   the company repurchased  trust preferred securities  approximating million face value  for a cash purchase price of approximately million
