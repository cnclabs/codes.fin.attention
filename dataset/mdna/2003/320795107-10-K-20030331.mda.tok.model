december  ratios for capital leverage  tier capital to risk weighted assets  and total capital to risk weighted assets were   and  respectively  compared to   and  respectively  at december  net interest income margins the primary source of earnings for the company is net interest income  which is the difference between income earned on interest earning assets  such as loans and investment securities  and interest expense incurred on the interest bearing sources of funds  such as deposits and borrowings 
the level of net interest income is determined primarily by the average balances volume and the rate spreads between the interest earning assets and the company s funding sources 
net interest income increased to  for  a increase from the net interest income of  earned for the increase was attributable to growth in average earning assets  which increased by  or and an increase in the spreads realized between earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
average loans and loans held for sale increased by to  and average investments and other earning assets increased by to  the increase in average loans reflects the company s expansion of its commercial and real estate lending activities among middle market borrowers in the baltimore metropolitan area  the growth of the bank s mortgage banking activities  the bank s continued emphasis on consumer lending  and consumer finance receivables generated by finance maryland 
average earning asset growth was funded by an increase in average deposits of  or 
the increase in average deposits was due to the continued success of sales and marketing efforts in the company s retail banking and commercial banking divisions  and the popularity of the bank s flex cd products 
average other borrowed funds decreased by  or  as the company repaid a significant portion of outstanding borrowings as deposit growth was more than sufficient to fund earning asset growth

interest expense on deposits decreased to  in  a decrease of  or from  for growth in average interest bearing deposits of was mostly offset by a decline in the average rates paid on interest bearing deposits of basis points 
interest expense on borrowings declined  to  for  a decrease of from  for the decline in average balances of  as well as a decrease in the average rates paid on borrowings of basis points  contributed to the reduction 
the key performance measure for net interest income is the net interest margin  or net interest income divided by average earning assets 
the company s net interest margin is affected by loan pricing  mix of earning assets  and the distribution and pricing of deposits and borrowings 
the company s net interest margin was for the year ended december  as compared to for yields on average total earning assets decreased by basis points  while the cost of interest bearing deposits decreased by basis points and the cost of other borrowings decreased by basis points 
a higher proportion of deposit accounts as a percentage of funding contributed to the increase in the net interest margin

the company has utilized all prior net operating loss carryforwards for federal income tax purposes at december  net operating loss carryforwards for state income tax purposes approximated  and can be offset by future state taxable income of first mariner bancorp only 
management anticipates that it is more likely than not that the future operations of first mariner bancorp will not generate sufficient taxable income to realize the potential utilization of the net operating loss carryforward 
a valuation allowance equal to the deferred tax asset associated with the net operating loss carryforward of  has been established to reflect this uncertainty 
financial condition at december   the company s total assets were  as compared to  at december   an increase of 
this increase occurred as the company continued to benefit from the development of its bank branching and mortgage loan office network  expansion of commercial and retail business development efforts  formation of finance maryland and successful development and marketing of deposit and loan products 
loans at december  were  as compared to  on december   which represents an increase of  or 
increases were realized in commercial mortgage  residential construction  and consumer loans  while residential mortgage loans  commercial construction loans and commercial loans decreased 
loans held for sale increased by  as a result of significant mortgage loan origination volume  particularly in the fourth quarter 
investment securities increased by  interest bearing deposits increased by  due to growth in deposits and borrowed funds in excess of loan growth  the increase in loans held for sale  and growth in the investment portfolio 
total deposits increased by  an increase of from  at december  borrowings  repurchase agreements  and trust preferred offerings increased by  and increased overall dependence on borrowed funds to of total assets as of december   compared to as of december  loan portfolio the company s loan portfolio is expected to produce higher yields than investment securities and other interest earning assets  the absolute volume and mix of loans and the volume and mix of loans as a percentage of total earning assets is an important determinant of net interest margin 
the following table sets forth the composition of the bank s loan portfolio 
at december  in thousands loans commercial loans and lines of credit    commercial residential construction    commercial mortgages     residential construction consumer    residential mortgages     consumer      total loans      the largest increase in the loan portfolio occurred in the commercial mortgage category  which increased by  and reflected successful marketing and sales efforts  a strong regional economy  as well as a favorable interest rate environment 
consumer loans increased by  again due successful sales efforts  as well as a favorable economic and interest rate environment  and the formation of finance maryland 
residential real estate loans  which consist primarily of year and year adjustable rate mortgages  decreased by  the decrease in this category of loans reflects higher payoffs and lower originations of adjustable rate loans as historically low mortgage interest rates encouraged borrowers to elect fixed rate and year loans which were sold in the secondary market 
commercial loans decreased by  while commercial construction loans decreased by  approximately of the bank s loans have adjustable rates as of december  and approximately at december   including adjustable rate first mortgages indexed to us treasury obligations and variable home equity lines of credit tied to the prime interest rate 
interest rates on variable rate loans adjust to the current interest rate environment  whereas fixed rates do not allow this flexibility 
if interest rates were to increase in the future  the interest earned on the variable rate loans would improve  and if rates were to fall the interest earned would decline  thus impacting the company s interest income 
see also the discussion under liquidity and interest rate sensitivity below 
the following table sets forth the maturity distribution  classified according to sensitivity to changes in interest rate  for the bank s loan portfolio at december  some of the loans may be renewed or repaid prior to maturity

however  the bank seeks to rely primarily on the cash flow of its borrowers as the principal source of repayment 
although credit policies are designed to minimize risk  management recognizes that loan losses will occur and the amount of these losses will fluctuate depending on the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio as well as general and regional economic conditions 
the allowance for loan losses represents a reserve for potential losses in the loan portfolio 
the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses is evaluated periodically based on a review of all significant loans  with a particular emphasis on nonaccruing  past due and other loans that management believes require special attention 
for significant problem loans  management s review consists of evaluation of the financial strengths of the borrower and the guarantor  the related collateral  and the effects of economic conditions 
specific reserves against the remaining loan portfolio are based on analysis of historical loan loss ratios  loan chargeoffs  delinquency trends  previous collection experience  and the risk rating on each individual loan along with an assessment of the effects of external economic conditions 
allowance for loan loss allocation  which is set forth below  indicates the specific reserves allocated by loan type and also the general reserves included in the allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is a charge to earnings in the current period to maintain the allowance at a level management has determined to be adequate based upon factors noted above 
the company provided  for loan losses for the year ended december   as compared to  for the year ended december  the higher provision was primarily the result of an increase in the coverage ratio of the allowance for loan losses to total loans to as of december  from as of december  as of december  the allowance for loan losses was  as compared with the december  balance of  an increase of  or 
net charge offs of  and  were recognized for and  respectively

in determining the collectibility of certain loans  management also considers the fair value of any underlying collateral 
however  management s determination of the appropriate allowance level is based upon a number of assumptions about future events  which are believed to be reasonable  but which may or may not prove valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that charge offs in future periods will not exceed the allowance for loan losses or that additional increases in the allowance for loan losses will not be required 
as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans are classified as nonaccrual even though the presence of collateral or the borrowers financial strength may be sufficient to provide for ultimate repayment 
interest on non accrual residential real estate loans is recognized only when received

the increase resulted from the change in accumulated other comprehensive income of  the net retention of earnings of  and the issuance of additional capital of  the change in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss reflects the increase in value of the company s available for sale securities 
as market interest rates declined throughout  the value of securities classified as available for sale increased 
banking regulatory authorities have implemented strict capital guidelines directly related to the credit risk associated with an institution s assets 
banks and financial holding companies are required to maintain capital levels based on their risk adjusted assets so that categories of assets with higher deemed credit risks will require more capital support than assets with lower risk 
additionally  capital must be maintained to support certain off balance sheet instruments 
to date  the company has provided its capital requirements mainly through the funds received for its stock offerings 
in the future  the company may consider raising capital from time to time through an offering of common stock or other securities 
as reflected in the table for capital ratios  the company exceeded its capital adequacy requirements as of december  and and met the requirement for well capitalized under federal banking regulation 
the company continually monitors its capital adequacy ratios to ensure that the company exceeds regulatory capital requirements 
in december  mariner capital trust ii  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company  issued  of variable rate preferred securities due in december the entire amount of this issuance is included as additional total capital as of december  see note of the consolidated financial statements for more information concerning the company s preferred securities 
capital is classified as tier capital common stockholders equity less certain intangible assets plus a portion of the trust preferred securities and total capital tier plus the allowed portion of the allowance for loan losses and the portion of trust preferred securities not included in tier capital 
minimum required levels must at least equal for tier capital and for total capital 
in addition  institutions must maintain a minimum of leverage capital ratio tier capital to average total assets for the previous quarter 
the company s capital position is presented in the following table capital ratios december  minimum requirements for capital adequacy purposes to be well capitalized under prompt corrective action provision total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets tier capital leverage ratio the bank also maintains capital levels which qualify for well capitalized status under current regulatory guidelines 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for more detailed information on the bank s capital adequacy ratios 
interest rate sensitivity and liquidity interest rate sensitivity is an important factor in the management of the composition and maturity configurations of earning assets and funding sources 
the primary objective of asset liability management is to ensure the steady growth of the company s primary earnings component  net interest income 
net interest income can fluctuate with significant interest rate movements 
to lessen the impact of interest rate movements  management endeavors to structure the statement of financial condition so that repricing opportunities exist for both assets and liabilities in roughly equivalent amounts at approximately the same time intervals 
imbalances in these repricing opportunities at any point in time constitute interest rate sensitivity 
the measurement of the company s interest rate sensitivity  or gap  is one of the principal techniques used in asset liability management 
interest sensitive gap is the dollar difference between assets and liabilities which are subject to interest rate pricing within a given time period  including both floating rate or adjustable rate instruments and instruments which are approaching maturity 
the company s management and the board of directors oversee the asset liability management function and meet periodically to monitor and manage the statement of financial condition  control interest rate exposure  and evaluate pricing strategies for the company 
the asset mix of the statement of financial condition is continually evaluated in terms of several variables yield  credit quality  appropriate funding sources and liquidity 
management of the liability mix of the statement of financial condition focuses on expanding the various funding sources 
in theory  interest rate risk can be diminished by maintaining a nominal level of interest rate sensitivity 
in practice  this is made difficult by a number of factors including cyclical variation in loan demand  different impacts on interest sensitive assets and liabilities when interest rates change  and the availability of funding sources 
accordingly  the company undertakes to manage the interest rate sensitivity gap by adjusting the maturity of and establishing rates on the earning asset portfolio and certain interest bearing liabilities commensurate with management s expectations relative to market interest rates 
additionally  management may employ the use of off balance sheet instruments  such as interest rate swap or caps  to manage its exposure to interest rate movements 
management generally attempts to maintain a balance between rate sensitive assets and liabilities as the exposure period is lengthened to minimize the overall interest rate risk to the company 
the interest rate sensitivity position as of december  is presented in the table  rate sensitivity analysis below 
assets and liabilities are scheduled based on maturity or repricing data except for mortgage loans and mortgage backed securities which are based on prevailing prepayments assumptions and core deposits which are based on core deposit studies done for banks in the mid atlantic region 
the difference between rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities or the interest rate sensitivity gap  is shown at the bottom of the table 
as of december   the company s interest sensitive assets exceeded interest sensitive liabilities within a one year period by  or of total assets 
as of december   interest rate sensitive assets exceeded interest sensitive liabilities by  or 
the change in the interest rate sensitivity gap occurred due to growth in core deposits which are less rate sensitive  growth in time deposits with maturities in excess of one year  which funded increases in short term investments and interest bearing deposits  and growth in loans with maturities or repricing opportunities less than one year 
in addition to the use of interest rate sensitivity reports  the company tests its interest rate sensitivity through the deployment of simulation analysis 
earnings simulation models are used to estimate what effect specific interest rate changes would have the company s net interest income and net income 
simulation analysis provides a more rigorous and dynamic measure of interest sensitivity 
derivative financial instruments  such as interest rate caps  are included in the analysis 
changes in prepayments have been included where changes in behavior patterns are assumed to be significant to the simulation  particularly mortgage related assets 
call features on certain securities and borrowings are based on their call probability in view of the projected rate change  and pricing features such as interest rate floors are incorporated 
at december   the company s estimated earnings sensitivity profile reflected minimal sensitivity to interest rate changes 
based on an assumed increase of basis points over a one year period  the company s net interest income would decrease by if rates were to decrease  and it would increase by if rates were to increase

liquidity is primarily needed to meet the borrowing and deposit withdrawal requirements of the bank s customers and to fund current and planned expenditures 
liquidity is derived from increased customer deposits  the maturity distribution of the investment portfolio  loan repayment and income from earning assets 
the company s loan to deposit ratio was and for december  and  respectively 
funds received from new and existing depositors  provided a large source of liquidity for the years ended december  and the bank seeks to rely primarily on core deposits from customers to provide stable and cost effective sources of funding to support loan growth
