item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with item selected financial data and the m f worldwide consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
overview subsequent to the settlement  the company conducts its global business through one business segment 
the company is the world s largest producer of licorice extract 
sales are principally to the tobacco and confectionery industries for use as a flavoring ingredient 
the company also manufactures other flavoring ingredients from various botanicals 
the company considers revenue from international business to be that revenue which is generated outside the united states 
critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements require us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to accounts receivable  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
these estimates and judgments are reviewed by management on an ongoing basis 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue using the guidance from the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
revenue from product sales is recognized when title passes to the customer 
we do not have a history of significant product returns or revenue adjustments 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
income taxes we estimate our actual current tax liability together with our temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as net operating losses and depreciation  for tax and accounting purposes 
these temporary differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
at december   we had a million valuation allowance established against our deferred tax assets 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include and expense the allowance within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of income 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
long lived assets we assess the impairment of property  plant and equipment and investments in joint ventures whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
some factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  and o significant negative industry or economic trends 
when we determine that the carrying value of our long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  as of january   with the exception of provisions relating to nonamortization of goodwill and intangible assets acquired after june   which we adopted as of july  sfas no 
changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
upon adoption in  we discontinued amortization of goodwill resulting from business acquisitions 
we also reassessed the useful life of our other intangible assets  which consist of product formulations 
we determined the useful life of the product formulations to be indefinite  therefore  we also discontinued amortization of the product formulations in we perform impairment tests on our goodwill and product formulations annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that the assets might be impaired 
we measure impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
we also reevaluate the useful life of the product formulations annually to determine whether events and circumstances continue to support an indefinite useful life 
contingencies and indemnification agreements we record the estimated impacts of various conditions  situations or circumstances involving uncertain outcomes 
these events are called contingencies  and our accounting for such events is prescribed by sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
the accrual of a contingency involves considerable judgment on the part of management 
we use our internal expertise  and outside experts such as lawyers and tax specialists  as necessary  to help estimate the probability that a loss has been incurred and the amount or range of the loss 
the company has not recognized any liability in its financial statements for matters covered by indemnification agreements 
the company considers these obligations to be those of third party indemnitors and monitors their financial positions to determine the level of uncertainty associated with their ability to satisfy their obligations 
based upon the indemnitors active management of indemnifiable matters  discharging of the related liabilities when required  and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery set forth above  the company believes that the likelihood of failing to obtain reimbursement of amounts covered by insurance and indemnification is remote 
the company currently does not have any material contingencies that it believes require an accrual in the consolidated financial statements 
see item the tobacco industry and corporate indemnification matters  item legal proceedings  and note commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report on form k 
pensions the company has significant pension costs  assets and liabilities that are developed from actuarial valuations 
inherent in these valuations are key assumptions including discount rates  expected return on plan assets  mortality rates  and merit increases 
the company is required to consider current market conditions including changes in interest rates 
changes in the related pension asset liability and income costs may occur in the future due to changes in assumptions

the company is considering various alternatives for the application of its cash and cash equivalents on hand 
m f worldwide s principal business operations are conducted by its subsidiaries  and m f worldwide has no operations of its own 
accordingly  m f worldwide s only source of cash to pay its obligations  other than cash and cash equivalents on hand  is expected to be distributions with respect to its ownership interest in its subsidiaries

under the indemnification provisions of the tax sharing agreement and with respect to periods ending on or prior to june   mcg will generally be required to pay any tax liabilities of the company  except for foreign income taxes related to aerospace

the company believes that the indirect subsidiary s position is correct under french tax regulations and that the indirect subsidiary will prevail in any future negotiation or litigation 
in addition  the indirect subsidiary has taken an interest expense deduction on its french tax return for each completed tax year subsequent to see related party transactions panavision company tax sharing agreement 
other liquidity risks licorice root extract supply in addition to the liquidity risks noted above  the company may encounter liquidity risks arising from its supply of licorice extract 
the company tries to maintain a sufficient licorice root inventory and open purchase contracts to meet normal production needs for three years 
at december   the company had on hand approximately a three year supply of root 
licorice root has an indefinite retention period as long as it is kept dry  and therefore has experienced little  if any  material spoilage 
although the company has been able to obtain licorice root without interruption since world war ii  since there has been periodic instability in the areas of the world where licorice root grows  the company may in the future experience a short supply of licorice root due to these or other instabilities 
if the company is unable to obtain licorice root  or is unable to obtain licorice root in a cost effective manner  the company s business will be severely hampered and the company will experience severe liquidity difficulties 
customers in  the company s ten largest customers  eight of which are manufacturers of tobacco products  accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues and one customer  altria group inc accounted for approximately of the company s net revenues 
if altria group inc were to stop purchasing licorice from the company  it would have a significant adverse effect on the financial results of the company  which would also create severe liquidity problems for the company 
corporate indemnification matters prior to  a former subsidiary of the company manufactured certain asbestos containing friction products 
pneumo abex has been named  typically along with to as many as or more other companies  as a defendant in various personal injury lawsuits claiming damages relating to exposure to asbestos 
pursuant to indemnification agreements  the original indemnitor  has retained ultimate responsibility for asbestos related claims made through august and for certain asbestos related claims asserted thereafter 
in connection with the sale by abex in december of its friction products division  the second indemnitor assumed responsibility for substantially all of the asbestos related claims made after august federal mogul corporation purchased the second indemnitor in october in october  the second indemnitor filed a petition under chapter of the us bankruptcy code and stopped performing its indemnity obligations to the company 
performance of the second indemnitor s indemnity obligation is guaranteed by the indemnity guarantor 
following the bankruptcy filing of the second indemnitor  the company confirmed that the indemnity guarantor will fulfill the second indemnitor s indemnity obligations to the extent that they are no longer being performed by the second indemnitor 
during the third quarter of  the indemnity guarantor repaid the company  following an arbitration between the company and the indemnity guarantor  million that the company had advanced for indemnified matters 
pneumo abex s former subsidiary maintained product liability insurance covering substantially all of the period during which asbestos containing products were manufactured 
the subsidiary commenced litigation in against a portion of these insurers in order to confirm the availability of this coverage 
as a result of settlements in that litigation  other coverage agreements with other carriers and payments by the original indemnitor  the second indemnitor and the indemnity guarantor pursuant to their indemnities  pneumo abex is receiving reimbursement in full each month for its monthly expenditures for asbestos related claims 
pneumo abex is unable to forecast either the number of future asbestos related claimants or the amount of future defense and settlement costs associated with present or future asbestos related claims 
the transfer agreement further provides that mcg will indemnify pneumo abex with respect to all environmental matters associated with pneumo abex s and its predecessor s operations to the extent not paid by third party indemnitors or insurers  other than the operations relating to pneumo abex s aerospace business which were sold to parker hannifin corporation in april accordingly  environmental liabilities arising after the transaction with the original indemnitor that relate to the company s former aerospace facilities will be the responsibility of pneumo abex 
the original indemnitor is obligated to indemnify pneumo abex for costs  expenses and liabilities relating to environmental and natural resource matters to the extent attributable to the pre operation of the businesses acquired from the original indemnitor  subject to certain conditions and limitations principally relating to compliance with notice  cooperation and other procedural requirements 
the original indemnitor is generally discharging its environmental indemnification liabilities in the ordinary course 
it is generally not possible to predict the ultimate total costs relating to any remediation that may be demanded at any of the sites subject to the indemnity from the original indemnitor due to  among other factors  uncertainty regarding the extent of prior pollution  the complexity of applicable environmental laws and regulations and their interpretations  uncertainty regarding future changes to such laws and regulations or their enforcement  the varying costs and effectiveness of alternative cleanup technologies and methods  and the questionable and varying degrees of responsibility and or involvement by pneumo abex 
however  the aggregate cost of cleanup and related expenses with respect to matters for which pneumo abex  together with numerous other third parties  have been named potentially responsible parties should be substantially less than million  including approximately million in remedial action costs in respect of one site actively managed and funded by the original indemnitor 
on february   the company  through pneumo abex  entered into the reimbursement agreement 
the reimbursement agreement provides for letters of credit totaling million covering certain environmental issues relating to such site and not related to the current business of pneumo abex 
during  the environmental protection agency reduced the letter of credit requirements to million 
the cost of the letters of credit are being funded by mcg and or the original indemnitor 
pneumo abex had million of letters of credit outstanding at both december  and  respectively  in connection with the reimbursement agreement 
the company has not recognized any liability in its financial statements for matters covered by indemnification agreements 
the company considers these obligations to be those of third party indemnitors and monitors their financial positions to determine the level of uncertainty associated with their ability to satisfy their obligations 
based upon the indemnitors active management of indemnifiable matters  discharging of the related liabilities when required  and financial positions based upon publicly filed financial statements  as well as the history of insurance recovery set forth above  the company believes that the likelihood of failing to obtain reimbursement of amounts covered by insurance and indemnification is remote 
during  the original indemnitor and pneumo abex conducted an arbitration concerning certain aspects of the scope of the indemnity from the original indemnitor 
on march   the arbitration panel issued its decision confirming that the indemnity applies as described herein  except that it did not extend to asbestos related claims  all of which have been resolved previously 
various legal proceedings  claims and investigations are pending against m f worldwide and pneumo abex  including those relating to commercial transactions  product liability  safety and health matters and other matters 
m f worldwide and pneumo abex are involved in various stages of legal proceedings  claims  investigations and cleanup relating to environmental or natural resource matters  some of which relate to waste disposal sites 
most of these matters are covered by insurance  subject to deductibles and maximum limits  and by third party indemnities 
the former aerospace business of the company formerly sold certain of its aerospace products to the us government or to private contractors for the us government 
certain claims for allegedly defective pricing made by the government with respect to certain of these aerospace product sales were retained by pneumo abex in the aerospace sale and remain outstanding 
in each case pneumo abex contests the allegations made by the government and has been attempting to resolve these matters without litigation 
the company believes that the outcome of such pending legal proceedings in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the company carries general liability insurance but has no health hazard policy  which  to the best of the company s knowledge  is consistent with industry practice

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates  which could affect its business  results of operations and financial condition 
the company manages its exposure to these market risks through its regular operating and financing activities 
as of december  and  the company s net foreign currency market exposures are primarily the euro 
most of the company s export sales and purchases of licorice raw materials are made in us dollars 
the company s french subsidiary sells in several foreign currencies as well as the us dollar and purchases raw materials principally in us dollars 
at the present time  the company does not generally hedge against foreign currency fluctuations 
management does not foresee nor expect any significant changes in foreign currency exposure in the near future 
as of december  and  a appreciation in foreign currency exchange rates from the prevailing market rates would increase the related net unrealized gain by million and million  respectively 
conversely  a depreciation in these currencies from the prevailing market rates would decrease the related net unrealized gain by million and million  as of december  and  respectively 
the company is exposed to changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt 
a hypothetical increase in the interest rates applicable to and would have resulted in an increase to interest expense of approximately million and million  respectively 
conversely  a hypothetical decrease in the interest rates applicable to and would have decreased interest expense by approximately million and million  respectively 
at december   the company believes that the carrying value of its amounts payable under the pneumo abex amended credit agreement approximate fair value based upon current yields for debt issues of similar quality and terms 
the company only has floating rate debt at the present time 
neither the company nor its subsidiaries had any interest rate swap agreements in effect at december  management does not foresee nor expect any significant changes in its exposure to interest rate fluctuations or in how such exposure is managed
