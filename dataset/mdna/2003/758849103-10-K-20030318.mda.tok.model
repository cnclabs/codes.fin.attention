the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes thereto of regency centers corporation regency or company appearing elsewhere in the annual report 
organization regency is a qualified real estate investment trust reit  which began operations in we invest in retail shopping centers through our partnership interest in regency centers  lp  rclp an operating partnership in which regency currently owns approximately of the outstanding common partnership units common units 
regency s acquisition  development  operations and financing activities  including the issuance of common units or cumulative redeemable preferred units preferred units  are generally executed by rclp 
shopping center business we are a national owner  operator and developer of grocery anchored neighborhood retail shopping centers 
a list of our shopping centers including those partially owned through joint ventures  summarized by state and in order of largest holdings  including their gla follows december  december  location properties gla leased properties gla leased florida   california   texas   georgia   ohio   colorado   north carolina   washington   virginia   oregon   alabama   arizona   tennessee   south carolina   kentucky   illinois   michigan   delaware   new jersey   missouri   pennsylvania   mississippi  wyoming  maryland  total   excludes pre stabilized properties under development we are focused on building a portfolio of grocery anchored neighborhood shopping centers that are positioned to withstand adverse economic conditions by providing consumers with convenient shopping for daily necessities and adjacent local tenants with foot traffic 
regency s current investment markets are stable  and we expect to realize growth in net income as a result of increasing occupancy in the portfolio  increasing rental rates  development and acquisition of shopping centers in targeted markets  and redevelopment of existing shopping centers 
the following table summarizes the four largest grocery tenants occupying our shopping centers  including those partially owned through joint ventures at december  percentage of percentage of grocery number of company annualized average remaining anchor stores a owned gla base rent lease term kroger years publix years safeway years albertsons years a includes grocery tenant owned stores on january   kmart corporation  a tenant in four of our shopping centers  filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptcy code 
under chapter bankruptcy protection  kmart has the ability to reject pre petition lease agreements and cease paying rent 
kmart rejected two leases representing  of annual base rent and closed both stores 
we have two other leases with kmart representing  of annual base rent 
both of these stores are open and operating  however  we have no assurance that kmart will be able to continue rental payments on these two stores in the future 
as a result of the kmart store closing at one of our shopping centers  combined with an earlier closing of an adjacent winn dixie grocery store  we determined that the value of this shopping center had been permanently impaired 
as a result  we recorded a provision for loss on operating properties of million during acquisition and development of shopping centers we have implemented a growth strategy dedicated to developing and acquiring high quality shopping centers 
our development program makes a significant contribution to our overall growth 
development is customer driven  meaning we generally have an executed lease from the grocery anchor before we begin construction 
developments serve the growth needs of our grocery and specialty retail customers  result in modern shopping centers with year leases from the grocery anchors  and produce either attractive returns on invested capital or profits from sale 
this development process can require to months from initial land or redevelopment acquisition through construction  lease up and stabilization  depending upon the size and type of project 
generally  anchor tenants begin operating their stores prior to construction completion of the entire center  resulting in rental income during the development phase 
during  we acquired the land and began development on new projects representing estimated total costs at completion of million  compared with starting new projects during with estimated costs at completion of million 
at december   we had projects under construction or undergoing major renovations  which  when completed  are expected to represent an investment of million before the estimated reimbursement of certain tenant related costs and projected sales proceeds from adjacent land and out parcels of million 
costs necessary to complete these developments will be million  are generally already committed as part of existing construction contracts  and will be expended through these developments are approximately completed and pre leased 
regency has a equity interest in and serves as property manager for columbia regency retail partners  llc columbia  a joint venture with the oregon state treasury that was formed for the purpose of investing in retail shopping centers 
during  columbia acquired a shopping center from the company for million  for which the company received net proceeds of million 
at december   columbia owned shopping centers with a net book value of million 
regency has a equity interest in and serves as property manager for macquarie countrywide regency  llc  mcwr a joint venture with an affiliate of macquarie countrywide trust of australia  a sydney  australia based property trust focused on investing in grocery anchored shopping centers 
during  mcwr acquired shopping centers from the company for million  for which the company received net proceeds of million and a note receivable of million 
mcwr is currently in the process of placing third party fixed rate mortgages on the properties  the proceeds of which will be used to repay the note receivable 
in january  the note was reduced by million  and we expect the balance of the note receivable to be repaid during the company recognized gains on these sales of million  which represents million related to operating properties  recorded as a gain on the sale of operating properties  and million related to development properties  recorded as service operations revenue 
the recognition of gain is recorded on only that portion of the sale to mcwr not attributable to the company s joint venture interest 
at december   mcwr owned shopping centers with a net book value of million 
columbia and mcwr intend to continue to acquire retail shopping centers  some of which they may acquire directly from regency 
for those properties acquired from third parties  regency is required to provide its pro rata share of the purchase price 
liquidity and capital resources we expect that the cash generated from revenues will provide the necessary funds on a short term basis to pay our operating expenses  interest expense  scheduled principal payments on outstanding indebtedness  recurring capital expenditures necessary to maintain our shopping centers properly  and distributions to stock and unit holders 
net cash provided by operating activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
during and  respectively  we incurred capital expenditures of million and million to improve our shopping center portfolio  paid scheduled principal payments of million and million to our lenders  and paid dividends and distributions of million and million to our share and unit holders 
although base rent is supported by long term lease contracts  tenants who file bankruptcy have the right to cancel their leases and close the related stores 
in the event that a tenant with a significant number of leases in our shopping centers files bankruptcy and cancels its leases  we could experience a significant reduction in our revenues 
we are not currently aware of any current or pending bankruptcy of any of our tenants that would cause a significant reduction in our revenues  and no tenant represents more than of our annual base rental revenues 
we expect to meet long term capital requirements for maturing debt  the acquisition of real estate  and the renovation or development of shopping centers from i cash generated from operating activities after the payments described above  ii proceeds from the sale of real estate  iii joint venturing of real estate  iv increases in debt  and v equity raised in the private or public markets 
additionally  the company has the right to call and repay outstanding preferred units five years after their issuance date  at the company s discretion  which could begin during the sources of repaying preferred units would include those listed above 
our commitment to maintaining a high quality portfolio dictates that we continually assess the value of all of our properties and sell to third parties those operating properties that no longer meet our long term investment standards 
we may also sell a portion of an operating or development property to one of our joint ventures  which may provide regency with a capital source for new development and acquisitions  as well as market based fees that we may earn as the asset manager 
by selling a property to a joint venture  regency owns less than of the property  generally to  and shares the risks and rewards of the property with its partner 
proceeds from the sale or joint venturing of properties are included in net investing activities on the consolidated statement of cash flows 
during  net proceeds from the sale or joint venturing of real estate was million  compared with million during  and were used primarily to reduce the balance of the unsecured line of credit the line 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   and generally means that the net proceeds from the sale or joint venturing of real estate was greater than the cash invested in new acquisitions or developments 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  and generally means that cash invested in new acquisitions or developments was greater than the net proceeds from selling or joint venturing real estate 
net cash used in financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and outstanding debt at december  and consists of the following in thousands notes payable fixed rate mortgage loans   variable rate mortgage loans   fixed rate unsecured loans   total notes payable   unsecured line of credit   total   mortgage loans are secured by certain real estate properties  and may be prepaid  but could be subject to a yield maintenance premium 
mortgage loans are generally due in monthly installments of interest and principal  and mature over various terms through variable interest rates on mortgage loans are currently based on libor plus a spread in a range of basis points to basis points 
fixed interest rates on mortgage loans range from to 
interest rates paid on the line  which are based on libor plus  at december  and were and  respectively 
the spread that we pay on the line is dependent upon maintaining specific investment grade ratings 
we are also required to comply  and are in compliance  with certain financial and other covenants customary with this type of unsecured financing 
the line is used primarily to finance the acquisition and development of real estate  but is also available for general working capital purposes 
during  the company assumed debt with a fair value of million related to the acquisition of five properties  which includes debt premiums of million based upon above market interest rates of the debt instruments 
debt premiums are being amortized over the terms of the related debt instruments 
on january   the company completed a million unsecured debt offering with an interest rate of 
these notes were priced at  are due on january  we used the net proceeds of these offerings to reduce the balance of the line 
during  the company completed million of unsecured debt offerings with an interest rate of to that are due in during  the company completed million of unsecured debt offerings with an interest rate of to  which are due in as of december   scheduled principal repayments on notes payable and the line were as follows in thousands scheduled principal term loan total scheduled payments by year payments maturities payments includes the line    beyond five years    unamortized debt premiums   total    unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures in which we have an investment had notes and mortgage loans payable of million at december   and the company s proportionate share of these loans was million 
rclp has issued preferred units in various amounts since  the net proceeds of which we used to reduce the balance of the line 
rclp sold the issues primarily to institutional investors in private placements 
the preferred units  which may be called by rclp after certain dates ranging from to  have no stated maturity or mandatory redemption  and they pay a cumulative  quarterly dividend at fixed rates ranging from to 
at any time after years from the date of issuance  the preferred units may be exchanged by the holders for cumulative redeemable preferred stock preferred stock at an exchange rate of one share for one unit 
the preferred units and the related preferred stock are not convertible into regency common stock 
at december  and  the face value of preferred units issued was million with an average fixed distribution rate of 
we intend to continue growing our portfolio through acquisitions and developments  either directly or through our joint venture relationships 
because acquisition and development activities are discretionary in nature  they are not expected to burden the capital resources we have currently available for liquidity requirements 
regency expects that cash provided by operating activities  unused amounts available under the line  and cash reserves are adequate to meet liquidity requirements 
critical accounting policies and estimates knowledge about our accounting policies is necessary for a complete understanding of our financial results  and discussions and analysis of these results 
the preparation of our financial statements requires that we make certain estimates that impact the balance of assets and liabilities at a financial statement date and the reported amount of income and expenses during a financial reporting period 
these accounting estimates are based upon our judgments and are considered to be critical because of their significance to the financial statements and the possibility that future events may differ from those judgments  or that the use of different assumptions could result in materially different estimates 
we review these estimates on a periodic basis to ensure reasonableness 
however  the amounts we may ultimately realize could differ from such estimates 
capitalization of costs we have an investment services group with an established infrastructure that supports the due diligence  land acquisition  construction  leasing and accounting of our development properties 
all direct and indirect costs related to these activities are capitalized 
included in these costs are interest and real estate taxes incurred during construction as well as estimates for the portion of internal costs that are incremental  and deemed directly or indirectly related to our development activity 
if future accounting standards limit the amount of internal costs that may be capitalized  or if our development activity were to decline significantly without a proportionate decrease in internal costs  we could incur a significant increase in our operating expenses 
valuation of real estate investments our long lived assets  primarily real estate held for investment  are carried at cost unless circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the assets may not be recoverable 
we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate such an evaluation is warranted 
the review involves a number of assumptions and estimates used in determining whether impairment exists 
depending on the asset  we use varying methods such as i estimating future cash flows  ii determining resale values by market  or iii applying a capitalization rate to net operating income using prevailing rates in a given market 
these methods of determining fair value can fluctuate up or down significantly as a result of a number of factors including changes in the general economy of those markets in which we operate  tenant credit quality  and demand for new retail stores 
if we determine that impairment exists due to the inability to recover an asset s carrying value  a provision for loss is recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeds estimated fair value 
income tax status the prevailing assumption underlying the operation of our business is that we will continue to operate so as to qualify as a reit  defined under the internal revenue code 
certain income and asset tests are required to be met on a periodic basis to ensure we continue to qualify as a reit 
as a reit  we are allowed to reduce taxable income by all or a portion of our distributions to stockholders 
as we evaluate each transaction entered into  we determine the impact that these transactions will have on our reit status 
determining our taxable income  calculating distributions  and evaluating transactions requires us to make certain judgments and estimates as to the positions we take in our interpretation of the internal revenue code 
because many types of transactions are susceptible to varying interpretations under federal and state income tax laws and regulations  our positions are subject to change at a later date upon final determination by the taxing authorities 
results from operations comparison of to at december   we were operating or developing shopping centers 
we identify our shopping centers as either development properties or stabilized properties 
development properties are defined as properties that are in the construction and initial lease up process that are not yet fully leased fully leased generally means greater than leased and occupied 
stabilized properties are those properties that are generally greater than leased and  if they were developed  are more than three years beyond their original development start date 
at december   we had stabilized shopping centers that were leased 
revenues increased million  or  to million in this increase was due primarily to our realization of a full year of revenues from new developments and from growth in rental rates of the operating properties 
in  rental rates grew by from renewal leases and new leases replacing previously occupied spaces in the stabilized properties 
minimum rent increased million  or  and recoveries from tenants increased million  or 
service operations revenue includes management fees  commission income  and gains or losses from the sale of land and development properties without significant operations

profits from sales of real estate will not be recognized by the company unless a sale has been consummated  the buyer s initial and continuing investment is adequate to demonstrate a commitment to pay for the property  the company has transferred to the buyer the usual risks and rewards of ownership  and the company does not have substantial continuing involvement with the property 
service operations revenue decreased million to million in  or 
the decrease was due primarily to the adoption of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement  which requires million of gains related to sales to be presented under discontinued operations 
operating expenses increased million  or  to million in combined operating  maintenance  and real estate taxes increased million  or  during to million 
the increase was primarily due to new developments that incurred expenses for only a portion of the previous year  and general increases in operating expenses on the stabilized properties 
general and administrative expenses were million during compared with million in  or higher  as a result of the company opening several branch offices in new markets  and general salary and benefit increases 
depreciation and amortization increased million during related to higher acquisition and development activity and the depreciation of operating properties classified as held for sale in that no longer met the criteria under statement we review our real estate portfolio for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that we may not be able to recover the carrying amount of an asset 
regency determines whether impairment has occurred by comparing the property s carrying value to an estimate of fair value based upon the methods described above in our critical accounting policies 
in the event the properties are impaired  we write down assets to fair value for held and used assets  and fair value less costs to sell for held for sale assets 
during  we recorded a provision for loss of million 
net interest expense increased to million in from million in  or 
the increase was primarily due to average outstanding debt balances during exceeding by million and lower interest capitalization on new developments 
average interest rates on outstanding debt declined to at december  from at december  income from discontinued operations was million in compared with million in  primarily due to million in gains we recognized on the sale of operating properties and stabilized properties in our development portfolio

at december   we were operating or developing shopping centers of which we had stabilized shopping centers that were leased 
at december   these same stabilized properties were leased 
service operations revenue increased by million to million in  or 
the increase was primarily due to a million increase in gains from the sale of land and out parcels  a million increase in management fees primarily related to the columbia and mcwr joint ventures  offset by a million reduction in development profits 
the reduction in development profits was a result of selling fewer developments during compared with operating expenses increased million  or  to million in combined operating  maintenance  and real estate taxes increased million  or  during to million

general and administrative expenses were million during compared with million in  or higher  as a result of general salary and benefit increases 
depreciation and amortization increased million during  or  primarily due to developments that only operated for part of the year during during and  we recorded a provision for loss on operating properties held for sale of million and million  respectively

stock purchase loans in previous years  as part of our long term incentive compensation plan  the company structured stock purchase plans whereby executives could acquire common stock at fair market value by investing their own capital in combination with loans provided by regency 
these interest bearing  full recourse loans were secured by stock  which was held as collateral by regency 
as part of the executive s compensation program  the company granted partial forgiveness of the unpaid principal balance based upon specified performance criteria and the passage of time 
the company ceased making these types of loans after and has not originated any new personal loans to our employees since that date 
as of september   all participants agreed to repay the entire balance of their loans outstanding with a portion of the common shares held as collateral  valued at fair market value on that day 
the company  in return  granted the participants restricted stock and stock options that are intended to provide them with the same level of compensation benefits that they would have received under existing agreements for specified forgiveness amounts 
new accounting standards and accounting changes in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities interpretation  which is intended to clarify the application of accounting research bulletin no

environmental matters regency  like others in the commercial real estate industry  is subject to numerous environmental laws and regulations 
the operation of dry cleaning plants at our shopping centers is the principal environmental concern 
we believe that the tenants who operate these plants do so in accordance with current laws and regulations and have established procedures to monitor their operations 
additionally  we use all legal means to cause tenants to remove dry cleaning plants from our shopping centers 
where available  we have applied and been accepted into state sponsored environmental programs 
we have a blanket environmental insurance policy that covers regency against third party liabilities and remediation costs on shopping centers that currently have no known environmental contamination 
we have also placed environmental insurance on specific properties with known contamination in order to mitigate regency s environmental risk 
we believe that the ultimate disposition of currently known environmental matters will not have a material effect on regency s financial position  liquidity  or operations 
inflation inflation has remained relatively low and has had a minimal impact on the operating performance of our shopping centers  however  substantially all of our long term leases contain provisions designed to mitigate the adverse impact of inflation 
such provisions include clauses enabling us to receive percentage rentals based on tenants gross sales  which generally increase as prices rise  and or escalation clauses  which generally increase rental rates during the terms of the leases 
such escalation clauses are often related to increases in the consumer price index or similar inflation indices 
in addition  many of our leases are for terms of less than years  which permits us to seek increased rents upon re rental at market rates 
most of our leases require tenants to pay their share of operating expenses  including common area maintenance  real estate taxes  and insurance and utilities  thereby reducing our exposure to increases in costs and operating expenses resulting from inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk regency is exposed to interest rate changes primarily as a result of the line of credit and long term debt used to maintain liquidity  fund capital expenditures and expand regency s real estate investment portfolio 
regency s interest rate risk management objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower its overall borrowing costs 
to achieve its objectives  regency borrows primarily at fixed rates and may enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps  caps and treasury locks in order to mitigate its interest rate risk on a related financial instrument 
regency has no plans to enter into derivative or interest rate transactions for speculative purposes 
regency s interest rate risk is monitored using a variety of techniques 
the table below presents the principal cash flows in thousands  weighted average interest rates of remaining debt  and the fair value of total debt in thousands  by year of expected maturity to evaluate the expected cash flows and sensitivity to interest rate changes 
fair thereafter total value fixed rate debt         average interest rate for all debt variable rate libor debt     average interest rate for all debt as the table incorporates only those exposures that exist as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions  which could arise after that date 
moreover  because firm commitments are not presented in the table above  the information presented therein has limited predictive value 
as a result  regency s ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during the period  its hedging strategies at that time  and interest rates
