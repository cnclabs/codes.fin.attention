item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion is intended to assist in an understanding of the company s historical financial position and results of operations for each year in the three year period ended december  the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report contain detailed information that should be referred to in conjunction with the following discussion 
general the company s future results of operations and growth are substantially dependent upon i its ability to acquire or find and successfully develop additional oil and gas reserves and ii the prevailing prices for oil and gas 
at december   the company s proved reserves were comprised of approximately proved developed reserves 
if the company is unable to economically acquire or find significant new reserves for development and exploitation  the company s oil and gas production  and thus its revenues  would decline gradually as its reserves are produced 
in addition  oil and gas prices are dependent upon numerous factors beyond the company s control  such as economic  political and regulatory developments and competition from foreign and other sources of energy 
the oil and gas markets have historically been very volatile 
in particular  gas prices in the first quarter of were at unusually high levels  but experienced a sharp decline in the fourth quarter of during and the first quarter  oil and gas prices have increased significantly 
any significant and extended decline in the price of oil or gas would have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations  and could result in a reduction in the carrying value of the company s proved reserves and adversely affect its access to capital 
in and  the company received million in proceeds from the sale of convertible preferred stock 
on may   the convertible preferred stock will mandatorily convert into million shares of common stock 
the company currently has no plans to raise capital through the issuance of securities 
critical accounting policies the company follows the successful efforts method of accounting for its oil and gas properties 
under this method of accounting  the capitalized costs of unproven properties are periodically assessed to determine whether their value has been impaired below the capitalized cost  and if such impairment is indicated  a loss is recognized in exploration expense 
the company makes these assessments based on estimates of future oil and gas prices and considers such other factors as exploratory drilling results  future drilling plans and the lease expiration terms when assessing unproved properties for impairment 
accordingly  any change in these estimates or factors could materially impact exploration expense 
the company s financial position and results of operations are materially effected by changes in oil and gas prices 
the company makes estimates of future oil and gas prices to determine the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
requires the company to assess the need for an impairment of capitalized costs of proved oil and gas properties and the costs of wells and related equipment and facilities on a property by property basis 
at december  the weighted average oil and gas prices used for impairment assessment purposes were per barrel and per mcf  respectively 
applying sfas no 
 the company recognized non cash property impairment charges of million in  million in and million in accordingly  a significant reduction in oil and gas prices used to estimate future oil and gas revenues for impairment purposes could materially impact impairment expense 
the company uses estimates of proved oil and gas reserve quantities to estimate depletion  depreciation and amortization expense using the unit of production method of accounting 
the estimates of proved oil and gas reserve quantities are also effected by estimates of future oil and gas prices along with various other reservoir engineering estimates 
accordingly  a significant reduction in oil and gas reserve quantities could materially impact depletion  depreciation and amortization expense 
the company enters into various hedging arrangements with respect to portions of its oil  natural gas and ngl production to achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce exposure to price fluctuations 
net income and cash flows from operating activities can be significantly affected by the company s hedging activities if oil and gas prices change significantly during the hedging period

liquidity and capital resources liquidity virtually all of the company s exploration expenditures and a significant portion of its development expenditures are discretionary expenditures that are made based on current economic conditions and expected future oil and gas prices 
the company makes capital and exploration expenditures to develop and exploit existing oil and gas reserves as well as to acquire additional reserves through exploration or acquisition 
the company has significant flexibility in the timing of making capital expenditures on properties it operates and the company may also choose not to participate in capital expenditures on properties operated by others 
this flexibility allows the company to adjust its annual capital and exploration levels according to the liquidity and the other sources of operating capital 
the company generally uses cash flows from operating activities as its primary source of funds for capital and exploration expenditures 
the company has also used borrowings under its credit facility to fund certain acquisitions and capital expenditures 
in june and may  the company also issued preferred stock to provide additional sources of liquidity 

table of contents the wiser oil company the company s cash flows from operating activities are significantly effected by changes in oil and gas prices 
accordingly  the company s cash flows from operating activities would be significantly reduced by lower oil and gas prices  which would also reduce the company s capital and exploration expenditure levels 
lower oil and gas prices may also reduce the company s borrowing base under its credit facility and further reduce the company s ability to obtain funds 
in addition  changes in oil and gas prices may require the company to provide cash collateral under its hedging agreements which would also reduce its liquidity

capital sources funding for the company s business activities has been provided by cash flow from operations  borrowings under the credit agreement and the issuance of preferred stock in june and may while the company regularly engages in discussions relating to potential acquisitions of oil and gas properties  the company has no current agreement or commitment with respect to any such acquisitions which would be material to the company 
any future acquisitions may require additional financing and will be dependent upon financing arrangements available at the time 
on may  the company entered into an million revolving credit facility revolver which matures on may  the aggregate borrowing base under the revolver is million and is allocated million for general corporate purposes tranche a and million exclusively for acquisition of oil and gas properties tranche b 
the million aggregate borrowing base is also allocated million for canadian borrowings and million for us borrowings

the revolver imposes certain restrictions on sales of assets  payment of dividends  incurring of indebtedness and requires the company to maintain a minimum interest coverage ratio of and a minimum working capital ratio of  as defined 
under the revolver  there is no requirement to maintain restricted cash balances after may  at december   the company was in compliance with all debt covenants 
the company believes that cash flows from operations and borrowings under its credit facility will be sufficient to meet anticipated capital and exploration expenditure requirements excluding any material property acquisitions in if the company s cash flows from operations and borrowings are not sufficient to satisfy its capital and exploration expenditure requirements  there is no assurance that additional equity or debt financing will be available to meet such requirements 
capital and exploration expenditures the company requires capital primarily for the acquisition  development and exploitation of  and the exploration for  oil and gas properties  the repayment of indebtedness and general working capital needs 
during  subject to market conditions and drilling and operating results  the company expects to spend approximately to million on acquisition  development  exploitation and exploration activities 
other matters environmental and other regulatory matters the company s business is subject to certain federal  state  provincial and local laws and regulations relating to the development  exploitation  production and gathering of  and the exploration for  oil and gas  including those relating to the protection of the environment 
many of these laws and regulations have become more stringent in recent years  often imposing greater liability on a larger number of potentially responsible parties 
although the company believes it is in substantial compliance with all applicable laws and regulations  the requirements imposed by laws and regulations are frequently changed and subject to interpretation  and the company is unable to predict the ultimate cost of compliance with these requirements or their effect on its operations 
although significant expenditures may be required to comply with governmental laws and regulations applicable to the company  compliance has not had a material adverse effect on the earnings or competitive position of the company 

table of contents the wiser oil company nyse market capitalization standard by letter dated december   the new york stock exchange nyse informed the company that its total market capitalization had fallen below million over a day trading period and its stockholders equity had fallen below million 
in accordance with the procedures set forth in the nyse listed company manual  the company responded promptly acknowledging the issue and committing to a file a business plan within forty five days to demonstrate its meeting those capitalization standards within the prescribed month period 
on february   the company sent a letter to the nyse and attached its business plan to demonstrate its commitment to continuing its nyse listing and setting forth steps to achieve by june   stockholders equity of million and market capitalization over a thirty day period of time of million 
the company filed an addendum to update its business plan by letter dated march   based upon certain newly obtained year end financial and reserve information 
the company s market capitalization on december  was million  based on million shares of outstanding fully diluted common stock  including its preferred stock as if it had converted into million shares of common stock as required by may   and a closing price of 
stockholders equity as of december  calculated using unaudited financials was million 
on march   the nyse accepted the company s business plan which approval requires the company to file quarterly updates with the nyse over the following month period of time 
the company has made financial projections in its business plan based on certain assumptions  including two commodity pricing scenarios a a base or plan case of estimated average commodity prices for the year of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas b a nymex strip case as of march with estimated average commodity prices for the year of of per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas 
both cases included commodity prices of per barrel of oil and mcf of gas in the first quarter of and per barrel of oil and per mcf of gas in the second quarter of in both instances  the company projects a return to minimum stockholders equity in because commodity prices are beyond the company s control  all financial projections developed by the company are subject to wide variance due to  among other reasons  the recent volatility in underlying oil and gas prices 
the company s operations are naturally not static 
accordingly  the business plan did not and cannot take into account many variables that directly affect its performance 
a few such considerations include unexpected increases or decreases in existing reserves due to natural causes  unexpected cost reductions and overruns in drilling  exploration and productions efforts  prices realized upon the purchase or disposition of oil and gas properties  interest and currency rate fluctuations affecting respectively floating bank debt and cross border operations in canada  and the availability or lack of opportunities in the capital markets for raising equity or increasing or refinancing the company s public debt 
thus  the company cannot guarantee its satisfaction of both nyse stockholders and market capitalization standards by june   nor whether the nyse will seek to de list the company s stock if such are not met 
in the event of such de listing  the company will likely seek to be listed on either the american stock exchange or nasdaq 
prior to the company s being listed on the nyse  it was listed on nasdaq 
if the company s stock is de listed from the nyse  such a de listing could result in a reduction in the price of the company s stock

among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the company s expectations are the volatility of oil and gas prices  the ability to acquire or find and successfully develop additional oil and gas reserves  the uncertainty of estimates of reserves and future net revenues  risks relating to acquisitions of producing properties  drilling and operating risks  general economic conditions  competition  domestic and foreign government regulations and other factors which are beyond the company s control

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company only uses derivative financial instruments such as commodity futures agreements to hedge against fluctuations in oil and gas prices 
gains and losses on these derivative instruments are recorded as adjustments to oil and gas sales 
the board of directors of the company have adopted a policy governing the use of derivative instruments which requires that all derivatives used by the company relate to an anticipated transaction and prohibits the use of speculative or leveraged derivatives 
interest rate risk total debt at december  included million of fixed rate debt and million of floating rate debt attributed to borrowings under the revolver 
as a result  the company s annual interest cost will fluctuate based on changes in short term interest rates 
the impact on annual cash flow of a change in the short term interest rate approximately basis points would be less than million 
at december   the estimated fair value of the company s fixed rate debt of million was million 
the fixed rate debt will mature in may commodity price risk the company has in the past entered into and may in the future enter into hedging arrangements with respect to portions of its oil  natural gas and ngl production to reduce its sensitivity to volatile commodity prices 
the company believes that hedging  although not free of risk  allows the company to achieve a more predictable cash flow and to reduce exposure to price fluctuations 
however  hedging arrangements limit the benefit to the company of increases in the prices of the hedged commodity 
moreover  the company s hedging arrangements apply only to a portion of its production and provide only partial price protection against declines in prices 
such arrangements may expose the company to risk of financial loss in certain circumstances 
the company expects that the amount of production it hedges will vary from time to time 
during   and  the company entered into various natural gas and crude oil forward sale agreements  natural gas price swaps and oil price collar agreements to hedge against price fluctuations 
oil and gas sales are adjusted for the effects of hedging transactions as the underlying hedged production is sold 
adjustments to oil and gas sales from the company s hedging activities resulted in an increase in revenues of million and million in and  respectively  and a decrease of million 
table of contents the wiser oil company in in addition  the company recognized a loss on derivatives of million and in and  respectively 
based on december  nymex futures prices  the fair value of the company s hedging arrangements at december  was a net loss of million 
a increase in both the oil price and the gas price would decrease this loss by million to a loss of million and a decrease in both the oil price and the gas price would increase this loss by million 
as of march  the company s hedging arrangements were as follows crude oil daily volume price per bbl january  to march   bbls january  to march   bbls january  to march   bbls floor  ceiling january  to march   bbls april  to june   bbls april  to june   bbls april  to june   bbls july  to september   bbls july  to september   bbls july  to september   bbls october  to december   bbls natural gas daily volume price per mmbtu january  to december   mmbtu floor  ceiling january  to december   mmbtu january  to march   mmbtu april  to june   mmbtu july  to september   mmbtu these are collar hedges whereby the company will receive the actual market price if the actual market price is between the floor price and the ceiling price 
if the actual market price is below or above the floor or ceiling prices  the price received by the company will be limited to the floor price or ceiling price  respectively 
the company continuously reevaluates its hedging program in light of market conditions  commodity price forecasts  capital spending and debt service requirements 
also see note to the company s consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this report 
for  the company has hedged approximately of its projected oil production and approximately of its projected gas production 
none of the company s hedging activities at december  were designated as hedges under the terms of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activity 
changes in the fair value of these arrangements are recognized in the consolidated statement of income as derivative gain or loss 
monthly cash settlements of these hedges are not included in the consolidated statement of income 
the derivative loss for the net change in fair value at december  was the company experienced hedging problems beyond its control in december  when all of its attractively priced derivative positions for were lost for the foreseeable future as a result of the chapter bankruptcy of enron north america corp  which was its counterparty to those transactions 
not only did the company lose the benefit of million gain in its hedging position  but the fourth quarter and first quarter precipitous declines in commodity prices forced the company into an unhedged  defensive posture 
the company feared that the lower prices being experienced in january and february would continue or fall throughout the remainder of however  gas and oil prices subsequently reversed their declines and the replacement positions resulted in a million loss  in addition to the million write off of the lost  beneficial enron hedges 
more generally  dramatic price volatility in the natural gas and oil markets has existed the past several years 
in fact  the average quoted prices for natural gas hovered around the low levels of per mcf in january  with the expectation of further decreases 
however  the market price dramatically reversed in the summer months of last year  which lead natural gas to trade at its recent levels in excess of per mcf

specifically  these tables disaggregate realized and unrealized changes in fair value  identify changes in fair value attributable to changes in valuation techniques  disaggregate estimated fair values at december   based on whether fair values are determined by quoted market prices or more subjective means  and indicate the maturities of contracts at december  fair value of contracts outstanding at the beginning of contracts realized or otherwise settled during fair value of new contracts when entered into during other changes in fair values fair value of contracts outstanding at the end of the source of fair value maturity in less than year prices actively quoted prices provided by other external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods the company only has non exchange contracts that will mature in less than a year 
foreign currency exchange risk the company receives a substantial portion of its oil and gas revenues in canadian dollars in and in and fluctuations in the exchange rates of the canadian dollar with respect to the us dollar could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations 
the company also borrows a portion of its funds under its credit facility in canadian dollars 
at december   outstanding borrowing were million in canadian dollars and million in us dollars 
fluctuations in the exchange rate of the canadian dollar also impact accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity on the balance sheet 
at december   accumulated other comprehensive income included a loss of million related to the canadian dollar exchange rate 
an increase in the canadian dollar exchange rate of 
would reduce this loss by million and a decrease in the canadian dollar exchange rate of
