we maintain a diversified portfolio of long term healthcare facilities and mortgages on healthcare facilities located in the united states 
in making investments  we generally have focused on established  creditworthy  middle market healthcare operators that meet our standards for quality and experience of management 
we have sought to diversify our investments in terms of geographic locations  operators and facility types 
as a consequence of our dividend arrearages and upcoming fleet debt maturity  we have not recently made facility investments and do not intend to make facility investments unless  and until we address our fleet revolving line of credit facility which expires on december  in evaluating potential investments  we consider such factors as o the quality and experience of management and the creditworthiness of the operator of the facility  o the facility s historical  current and forecasted cash flow and its adequacy to meet operational needs  capital expenditures and lease or debt service obligations  providing a competitive return on investment to us  o the construction quality  condition and design of the facility  o the geographic area and type of facility  o the tax  growth  regulatory and reimbursement environment of the community in which the facility is located  o the occupancy and demand for similar healthcare facilities in the same or nearby communities  and o the payor mix of private  medicare and medicaid patients 
one of our fundamental investment strategies is to obtain contractual rent escalations under long term  non cancelable  triple net leases and revenue participation through participating mortgage loans  and to obtain substantial liquidity deposits 
additional security is typically provided by covenants regarding minimum working capital and net worth  liens on accounts receivable and other operating assets  and various provisions for cross default  cross collateralization and corporate personal guarantees  when appropriate 
we prefer to invest in equity ownership of properties 
due to regulatory  tax or other considerations  we sometimes pursue alternative investment structures  including convertible participating and participating mortgages  that achieve returns comparable to equity investments 
the following summarizes the four primary investment structures currently used by us 
average annualized yields reflect existing contractual arrangements 
however  in view of the ongoing financial challenges in the long term care industry  we cannot assure you that the operators of our facilities will meet their payment obligations in full or when due 
therefore  the annualized yields as of january  set forth below are not necessarily indicative of or a forecast of actual yields  which may be lower 
purchase leaseback 
in a purchase leaseback transaction  we purchase the property from the operator and lease it back to the operator over terms typically ranging from to years  plus renewal options 
the leases originated by us generally provide for minimum annual rentals which are subject to annual formula increases based upon such factors as increases in the consumer price index cpi or increases in the revenue streams generated by the underlying properties  with certain fixed minimum and maximum levels 
generally  the operator holds an option to repurchase the property at set dates at prices based on specified formulas 
the average annualized yield from leases was at january  convertible participating mortgage 
convertible participating mortgages are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
interest rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases in the cpi or increases in the revenues generated by the underlying long term care facilities  with certain maximum limits 
convertible participating mortgages afford us the option to convert our mortgage into direct ownership of the property  generally at a point six to nine years from inception 
if we exercise our purchase option  we are obligated to lease the property back to the operator for the balance of the originally agreed term and for the originally agreed participations in revenues or cpi adjustments 
this allows us to capture a portion of the potential appreciation in value of the real estate 
the operator has the right to buy out our option at prices based on specified formulas 
the average annualized yield on these mortgages was approximately at january  participating mortgage 
participating mortgages are similar to convertible participating mortgages except that we do not have a purchase option 
interest rates are usually subject to annual increases based upon increases in the cpi or increases in revenues of the underlying long term care facilities  with certain maximum limits 
the average annualized yield on these investments was approximately at january  fixed rate mortgage 
these mortgages have a fixed interest rate for the mortgage term and are secured by first mortgage liens on the underlying real estate and personal property of the mortgagor 
the average annualized yield on these investments was at january  the following table identifies the years of expiration of the payment obligations due to us under existing contractual obligations as of january  this information is provided solely to indicate the scheduled expiration of payment obligations due to us  and is not a forecast of expected revenues 
mortgage rent interest total in thousands thereafter    total    the table set forth in item properties  contains information regarding our real estate properties  their geographic locations  and the types of investment structures as of december  borrowing policies 
we may incur additional indebtedness and have historically sought to maintain a long term debt to total capitalization ratio in the range of to 
total capitalization is total stockholders equity plus long term debt 
we intend to periodically review our policy with respect to our debt to total capitalization ratio and to modify the policy as our management deems prudent in light of prevailing market conditions 
our strategy generally has been to match the maturity of our indebtedness with the maturity of our investment assets  and to employ long term  fixed rate debt to the extent practicable in view of market conditions in existence from time to time 
we may use proceeds of any additional indebtedness to provide permanent financing for investments in additional healthcare facilities 
we may obtain either secured or unsecured indebtedness  and may obtain indebtedness which may be convertible into capital stock or be accompanied by warrants to purchase capital stock 
where debt financing is present on terms deemed favorable  we generally may invest in properties subject to existing loans  secured by mortgages  deeds of trust or similar liens on properties 
industry turmoil and continuing adverse economic conditions have caused the terms on which we can obtain additional borrowings to become unfavorable 
if we need capital to repay indebtedness as it matures  we may be required to liquidate investments in properties at times which may not permit realization of the maximum recovery on these investments 
this could also result in adverse tax consequences to us 
we may be required to issue additional equity interests in our company  which could dilute your investment in our company 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
federal income tax considerations 
we intend to make and manage our investments  including the sale or disposition of property or other investments  and to operate in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  unless  because of changes in circumstances or changes in the internal revenue code  our board of directors determines that it is no longer in our best interest to qualify as a reit 
as a reit  we generally will not pay federal income taxes on the portion of our taxable income which is distributed to stockholders 
securities or interest in persons primarily engaged in real estate activities 
in november  we formed omega worldwide  inc worldwide  a company which provides asset management services and management advisory services  as well as equity and debt capital to the healthcare industry  particularly residential healthcare services to the elderly 
on april   we contributed substantially all of our assets in principal healthcare finance limited phfl  an isle of jersey united kingdom company  to worldwide in exchange for approximately million shares of worldwide common stock and  shares of series b preferred stock 
of the million shares of worldwide common stock we received  approximately million were distributed on april  to our stockholders  and we sold million shares on april  during  we sold our investment in worldwide 
pursuant to a tender offer by four seasons health care limited four seasons for all of the outstanding shares of common stock of worldwide  we sold our investment  which consisted of million shares of common stock and  shares of preferred stock  to four seasons for cash proceeds of approximately million including million for preferred stock liquidation preference and accrued preferred dividends 
in addition  we sold our investment in phfl  which consisted of  ordinary shares and warrants to purchase  ordinary shares  to an affiliate of four seasons for cash proceeds of million 
both transactions were completed in september and provided aggregate cash proceeds of million 
we realized a gain from the sale of our investments in worldwide and phfl of million 
as of december   we no longer own any interest in worldwide or phfl 
in april  in conjunction with an acquisition by worldwide  we acquired an interest in principal healthcare finance trust  an australian unit trust  which owns nursing home facilities and assisted living units in australia and new zealand 
as of december   we hold a million investment in the trust 
policies with respect to certain activities 
if our board of directors determines that additional funding is required  we may raise such funds through additional equity offerings  debt financing  retention of cash flow subject to provisions in the internal revenue code concerning taxability of undistributed reit taxable income or a combination of these methods 
in the event that our board of directors determines to raise additional equity capital  it has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue additional common stock or preferred stock in any manner and on such terms and for such consideration it deems appropriate  including in exchange for property 
in july  we issued shares of our series c convertible preferred stock to explorer holdings  lp explorer in exchange for an investment of million 
borrowings may be in the form of bank borrowings  secured or unsecured  and publicly or privately placed debt instruments  purchase money obligations to the sellers of assets  long term  tax exempt bonds or financing from banks  institutional investors or other lenders  securitizations  any of which indebtedness may be unsecured or may be secured by mortgages or other interests in the asset 
such indebtedness may be recourse to all or any part of our assets or may be limited to the particular asset to which the indebtedness relates 
on december   we reached amended agreements with the bank groups under both of our revolving credit facilities 
as of the closing of the rights offering and the private placement to explorer on february   these amendments became effective 
as part of the amendment regarding our million revolving credit facility  we prepaid million originally scheduled to mature in march this voluntary prepayment resulted in a permanent reduction in the total commitment  thereby reducing the credit facility to million 
the agreement regarding our million revolving credit facility included a one year extension in maturity from december  to december   and a reduction in the total commitment from million to million 
as of december   our borrowings were million and million under the million and the million credit facilities  respectively 
we have authority to offer our common stock or other equity or debt securities in exchange for property and to repurchase or otherwise reacquire our shares or any other securities and may engage in such activities in the future 
similarly  we may offer additional interests in our operating partnership that are exchangeable into common shares or  at our option  cash  in exchange for property 
we also may make loans to our subsidiaries 
subject to the percentage of ownership limitations and gross income and asset tests necessary for reit qualification  we may invest in securities of other reits  other entities engaged in real estate activities or securities of other issuers  including for the purpose of exercising control over such entities 
we may engage in the purchase and sale of investments 
we do not underwrite the securities of other issuers 
our officers and directors may change any of these policies without a vote of our stockholders 
in the opinion of our management  our properties are adequately covered by insurance 
competition 
we compete for additional healthcare facility investments with other healthcare investors  including other real estate investment trusts 
the operators of the facilities compete with other regional or local nursing care facilities for the support of the medical community  including physicians and acute care hospitals  as well as the general public 
some significant competitive factors for the placing of patients in skilled and intermediate care nursing facilities include quality of care  reputation  physical appearance of the facilities  services offered  family preferences  physician services and price

our leased real estate properties are leased under provisions of master leases with initial terms typically ranging from to years  plus renewal options 
substantially all of the master leases provide for minimum annual rentals that are subject to annual increases based upon increases in the cpi or increases in revenues of the underlying properties  with certain limits 
under the terms of the leases  the lessee is responsible for all maintenance  repairs  taxes and insurance on the leased properties 
our owned and operated facilities  like those of our lessees and mortgagees  are subject to government regulation and derive a substantial portion of their net operating revenues from third party payors  including the medicare and medicaid programs 
these facilities are managed by independent third parties under management contracts 
these managers are responsible for the day to day operation of the facilities  including  among other things  patient care  staffing  billing and collection of patient accounts and facility level financial reporting 
for their services  the managers are paid a management fee  typically based on a percentage of nursing home revenues 
as of december   we had three properties classified as owned and operated 
see note subsequent events to our audited consolidated financial statements 
as a consequence of the financial difficulties encountered by a number of our operators  we have recovered various long term care assets pledged as collateral for the operators obligations either in connection with a restructuring or settlement with certain operators or pursuant to foreclosure proceedings 
under normal circumstances  we would seek to re lease or otherwise dispose of such assets as promptly as practicable 
when we adopt a plan to sell a property and hold a contract for sale  the property is classified as assets held for sale

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this document contains forward looking statements  including statements regarding potential asset sales  potential future changes in reimbursement  the future effect of the medicare cliff on our operators and plans to refinance or extend our upcoming debt maturity 
these statements relate to our expectations  beliefs  intentions  plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events  performance and underlying assumptions and other statements other than statements of historical facts 
in some cases  you can identify forward looking statements by the use of forward looking terminology including may  will  anticipates  expects  believes  intends  should or comparable terms or the negative thereof 
these statements are based on information available on the date of this filing and only speak as to the date hereof and no obligation to update such forward looking statements should be assumed 
our actual results may differ materially from those reflected in the forward looking statements contained herein as a result of a variety of factors  including  among other things i those items discussed in item above  ii regulatory changes in the healthcare sector  including without limitation  changes in medicare reimbursement  iii changes in the financial position of our operators  iv the ability of operators in bankruptcy to reject unexpired lease obligations  modify the terms of our mortgages  and impede our ability to collect unpaid rent or interest during the pendency of a bankruptcy proceeding and retain security deposits for the debtor s obligations  v our ability to dispose of assets held for sale on a timely basis and at appropriate prices  vi uncertainties relating to the operation of our owned and operated assets  including those relating to reimbursement by third party payors  regulatory matters and occupancy levels  vii our ability to manage  re lease or sell owned and operated assets  viii the availability and cost of capital  and ix competition in the financing of healthcare facilities 
overview the long term care industry changed dramatically following the balanced budget act of  which introduced the prospective payment system for the reimbursement of medicare patients in skilled nursing facilities  implementing an acuity based reimbursement system in lieu of the cost based reimbursement system historically used 
the prospective payment system significantly reduced payments to nursing home operators 
that reduction  in turn  has negatively affected the revenues of our nursing home facilities and the ability of our nursing home operators to service their capital costs to us 
many nursing home operators  including a number of our large nursing home operators  have sought protection under chapter of the bankruptcy act 
in response to the adverse impact of the prospective payment system reimbursement cuts  the federal government passed the balanced budget refinement act of balanced budget refinement act and the benefits improvement and protection act of benefits improvement and protection act  both of which increased payments to nursing home operators on an interim basis 
in prior years these increases positively affected the revenues of our nursing home facilities and the ability of our nursing home operators to service their capital costs to us 
in addition  the facilities that we own and currently operate for our own account were positively affected in prior years by the balanced budget refinement act and benefits improvement and protection act 
certain of the increases in medicare reimbursement for skilled nursing facilities provided for under the balanced budget refinement act and the benefits improvement and protection act ceased in october the partial expiration of balance budget relief act and benefits improvement and protection act increases as of october  has had an adverse impact on the revenues of the operators of nursing facilities and has negatively impacted some operators ability to satisfy their monthly lease or debt payments to us 
for further discussion  see item overview government healthcare regulation reimbursements and industry concentration risks 
unless congress enacts additional legislation  the loss of revenues associated with this occurrence will continue to have an adverse effect on our operators 
due to the temporary nature of the remaining payment increases  we cannot assure you that the federal reimbursement will remain at levels comparable to present levels and that such reimbursement will be sufficient for our lessees or mortgagors to cover all operating and fixed costs necessary to care for medicare and medicaid patients 
we also cannot assure you that there will be any future legislation to increase payment rates for skilled nursing facilities 
if payment rates for skilled nursing facilities are not increased in the future  some of our lessees and mortgagors may have difficulty meeting their payment obligations to us 
in addition  each state has its own medicaid program that is funded jointly by the state and federal government 
federal law governs how each state manages its medicaid program  but there is wide latitude for states to customize medicaid programs to fit the needs and resources of its citizens 
the balanced budget act repealed the federal payment standard  also known as the boren amendment  for hospitals and nursing facilities under medicaid  increasing states discretion over the administration of medicaid programs 
a number of states are considering legislation designed to reduce their medicaid expenditures which could result in decreased revenues for our lessees and mortgagors 
the initial impact of the prospective payment system negatively affected our financial results and our access to capital sources to fund growth and refinance existing indebtedness 
to obtain sufficient liquidity to enable us to address the maturity in july and february of indebtedness totaling million  we issued million of series c preferred stock to explorer holdings  lp explorer in july as described in more detail in note stockholders equity and stock options to our audited consolidated financial statements 
as a consequence of the financial difficulties encountered by a number of our nursing home operators in the late s  we have recovered various long term care assets pledged as collateral for the operators obligations either in connection with a restructuring or settlement with certain operators or pursuant to foreclosure proceedings 
under normal circumstances  we would seek to re lease or otherwise dispose of such assets as promptly as practicable 
however  a number of companies were actively marketing portfolios of similar assets and  in light of the market conditions in the long term care industry generally  it had become more difficult both to sell these properties and for potential buyers to obtain financing to acquire them 
as a result  during  million of assets previously classified as held for sale were reclassified to owned and operated assets as the timing and strategy for sale or  alternatively  re leasing  were revised in light of prevailing market conditions 
at december   we owned long term healthcare facilities that had been recovered from customers and were operated for our own account 
due to re leasing and asset sales  we owned three such facilities at december  during and  we experienced a significant increase in nursing home revenues attributable to the increase in owned and operated assets 
during  these increases abated as we re leased  sold or closed all but three of these facilities 
for the twelve months ended december   of our revenues were from owned and operated assets as compared to for the same twelve month period in in addition  in connection with the recovery of these assets  we often fund working capital and deferred capital expenditure needs for a transitional period until license transfers and other regulatory matters are completed and reimbursement from third party payors recommences 
our management intends to sell or re lease these assets as promptly as possible  consistent with achieving valuations that reflect our management s estimate of fair value of the assets 
we do not know  however  if  or when  the dispositions will be completed or whether the dispositions will be completed on terms that will enable us to realize the fair value of such assets 
in february  we suspended dividends on all common and preferred stock 
we do not know when  or if  we will resume dividend payments on our common stock or  if resumed  what the amount or timing of any dividend will be 
prior to recommencing the payment of dividends on our common stock  all accrued and unpaid dividends on our series a  b and c preferred stock must be paid in full 
we have made sufficient distributions to satisfy the distribution requirements under the reit rules of the internal revenue code of to maintain our reit status for for tax year  we are currently projecting a tax loss  therefore  we anticipate no distribution will be required to satisfy the reit rules 
however  if we have taxable income  we intend to make the necessary distributions to satisfy the reit requirements 
on february   we refinanced our investment in a baltimore  maryland asset leased by the united states postal service usps resulting in million of net cash proceeds 
the new  fully amortizing mortgage has a year term with a fixed interest rate of 
this transaction is cash neutral to us on a monthly basis  as lease payments due from usps equal debt service on the new loan 
on february   we raised gross proceeds of million through the completion of a rights offering and simultaneous private placement to explorer 
the proceeds from the rights offering and private placement were used to repay outstanding indebtedness and for working capital and general corporate purposes 
during  we paid off the remaining million of our notes that matured in june  resulting in a loss on early extinguishment of debt of approximately  in addition  during  as a result of foreclosure proceedings  we relinquished title to certain properties with a net carrying value of approximately million in satisfaction of certain mortgage obligations owed to the department of housing and urban development hud in the amount of million 
on june   we were named as a defendant in certain litigation brought against us in the us district court for the eastern district of michigan  detroit division  by madison ohi liquidity investors  llc madison  for the breach and or anticipatory breach of a revolving loan commitment 
ronald m 
dickerman and bryan gordon are partners in madison and limited guarantors guarantors of madison s obligations to us 
madison claimed damages as a result of the alleged breach of approximately million and damages in an amount ranging from to million for the anticipatory breach 
we filed counterclaims against madison and the guarantors seeking repayment of approximately million of unpaid principal on the loan  plus accrued interest 
effective as of september   the parties settled all claims in the suit in consideration of madison s payment of the sum of million 
the payment by madison consists of a million cash payment for our attorneys fees  with the balance evidenced by the amendment of the existing promissory note from madison to us 
the note reflects a principal balance of million  with interest accruing at per annum  payable over three years upon liquidation of the collateral securing the note 
the note is also fully guaranteed by the guarantors  provided that if all accrued interest and of original principal has been repaid within months  the guarantors will be released 
accordingly  a reserve of million was recorded relating to this note 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our significant accounting policies are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
these policies were followed in preparing the consolidated financial statements for all periods presented 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have identified six significant accounting policies as critical accounting policies 
these critical accounting policies are those that have the most impact on the reporting of our financial condition and those requiring significant judgments and estimates 
with respect to these critical accounting policies  we believe the application of judgments and assessments is consistently applied and produces financial information that fairly presents the results of operations for all periods presented 
the six critical accounting policies are owned and operated assets and assets held for sale 
when we acquire real estate pursuant to a foreclosure proceeding  it is designated as owned and operated assets and is recorded at the lower of cost or fair value and is included in real estate properties on our consolidated balance sheet 
operating assets and operating liabilities for the owned and operated properties are shown separately on the face of our consolidated balance sheet and are detailed in note segment information 
when a formal plan to sell real estate is adopted and we hold a contract for sale  the real estate is classified as assets held for sale  with the net carrying amount adjusted to the lower of cost or estimated fair value  less cost of disposal 
depreciation of the facilities is excluded from operations after management has committed to a plan to sell the asset 
upon adoption of financial accounting standards board fasb as of january   long lived assets sold or designated as held for sale after january  are reported as discontinued operations in our financial statements 
impairment of assets 
we periodically evaluate our real estate investments for impairment indicators 
the judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on factors such as market conditions  operator performance and legal structure 
if indicators of impairment are present  we evaluate the carrying value of the related real estate investments in relationship to the future undiscounted cash flows of the underlying facilities 
provisions for impairment losses related to long lived assets are recognized when expected future cash flows are less than the carrying values of the assets 
if the sum of the expected future cash flow  including sales proceeds  is less than carrying value  we then adjust the net carrying value of leased properties and other long lived assets to the present value of expected future cash flows 
loan impairment policy 
when management identifies an indication of potential loan impairment  such as non payment under the loan documents or impairment of the underlying collateral  the loan is written down to the present value of the expected future cash flows 
in cases where expected future cash flows cannot be estimated  the loan is written down to the fair value of the collateral 
accounts receivable 
accounts receivable consists primarily of lease and mortgage interest payments 
amounts recorded include estimated provisions for loss related to uncollectible accounts and disputed items 
on a monthly basis  we review the contractual payment versus actual cash payment received and the contractual payment due date versus actual receipt date 
when management identifies delinquencies  a judgment is made as to the amount of provision  if any  that is needed 
accounts receivable owned and operated assets 
accounts receivable from owned and operated assets consist of amounts due from medicare and medicaid programs  other government programs  managed care health plans  commercial insurance companies and individual patients

dividends 
in order to qualify as a reit  we are required to distribute dividends other than capital gain dividends to our stockholders in an amount at least equal to a the sum of i of our reit taxable income computed without regard to the dividends paid deduction and our net capital gain and ii of the net income after tax  if any  from foreclosure property  minus b the sum of certain items of non cash income 
in addition  if we dispose of any built in gain asset during a recognition period  we will be required to distribute at least of the built in gain after tax  if any  recognized on the disposition of such asset 
such distributions must be paid in the taxable year to which they relate  or in the following taxable year if declared before we timely file our tax return for such year and paid on or before the first regular dividend payment after such declaration 
in addition  such distributions are required to be made pro rata  with no preference to any share of stock as compared with other shares of the same class  and with no preference to one class of stock as compared with another class except to the extent that such class is entitled to such a preference 
to the extent that we do not distribute all of our net capital gain or do distribute at least  but less than of our reit taxable income  as adjusted  we will be subject to tax thereon at regular ordinary and capital gain corporate tax rates 
on february   we announced the suspension of all common and preferred dividends 
prior to recommencing the payment of dividends on our common stock  all accrued and unpaid dividends on our series a  b and c preferred stock must be paid in full 
we have made sufficient distributions to satisfy the distribution requirements under the reit rules to maintain our reit status for for tax year  we are projecting a tax loss  therefore  we anticipate no distribution will be required to satisfy the reit rules 
however  if we have taxable income  we intend to make the necessary distributions to satisfy the reit requirements 
the accumulated and unpaid dividends relating to all series of preferred stocks total million as of december  in aggregate  preferred dividends continue to accumulate at approximately million per quarter 
no common cash dividends were paid during and cash dividends paid totaled per common share for the dividend payout ratio  that is the ratio of per common share amounts for dividends paid to the diluted per common share amounts of funds from operations  was approximately for excluding the provision for loss on mortgages and notes receivable and severance and consulting agreement costs  the dividend payout ratio for was approximately 
we can give no assurance as to when or if the dividends will be reinstated on the preferred stock or common stock  or the amount of the dividends if and when such payments are recommenced 
on march   we exercised our option to pay the accrued  series c dividend from november  and the associated deferral fee by issuing  series c preferred shares to explorer holdings  lp on april   which are convertible into  shares of our common stock at per share 
such election resulted in an increase in the aggregate liquidation preference of series c preferred stock as of april  to  dividends paid in stock to a specific class of stockholders  such as our payment of our series c preferred stock in april  constitute dividends eligible for the dividends paid deduction 
since dividends on the series a and series b preferred stock have been in arrears for more than months  the holders of the series a and series b preferred stock voting together as a single class continue to have the right to elect two additional directors to our board of directors in accordance with the terms of the series a and series b preferred stock and our bylaws 
explorer  the sole holder of the series c preferred stock  also has the right to elect two other additional directors to our board of directors in accordance with the terms of the series c preferred stock and our bylaws 
explorer  without waiving its rights under the terms of the series c preferred stock or the stockholders agreement  has advised us that it is not currently seeking the election of the two additional directors resulting from the series c dividend arrearage unless the holders of the series a and series b preferred stock seek to elect additional directors 
the table below sets forth information regarding arrearages in payment of preferred stock dividends annual dividend arrearage as of title of class per share december  series a cumulative preferred stock  series b cumulative preferred stock  series c convertible preferred stock  total  liquidity 
we believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital  including funds from operations  expected proceeds from planned asset sales and our ability to negotiate an extension of our current debt maturities are adequate to finance operations  meet recurring debt service requirements and fund future investments through the next twelve months 
as a result of the october  medicare rate reductions and potential reductions in certain state medicaid reimbursements  refinancing our current debt maturity has become more difficult 
we continue to actively pursue refinancing alternatives in order to extend current debt maturities and provide greater financial flexibility 
among other things  we will continue discussions to extend or refinance our million credit facility  currently scheduled to mature in december at this time  there can be no assurance that we will be able to reach acceptable agreements with our bank lenders and or other capital sources to achieve the desired refinancing  or the terms of any such refinancing 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including the potential loss arising from adverse changes in interest rates 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes  but we seek to mitigate the effects of fluctuations in interest rates by matching the term of new investments with new long term fixed rate borrowing to the extent possible 
the market value of our long term fixed rate borrowings and mortgages are subject to interest rate risks 
generally  the market value of fixed rate financial instruments will decrease as interest rates rise and increase as interest rates fall 
the estimated fair value of our total long term borrowings at december  was million 
a one percent increase in interest rates would result in a decrease in the fair value of long term borrowings by approximately million 
we are subject to risks associated with debt or preferred equity financing  including the risk that existing indebtedness may not be refinanced or that the terms of such refinancing may not be as favorable as the terms of current indebtedness 
if we were unable to refinance our debt maturities on acceptable terms  we might be forced to dispose of properties on disadvantageous terms  which might result in losses to us and might adversely affect the cash available for distribution to stockholders  or to pursue dilutive equity financing 
if interest rates or other factors at the time of the refinancing result in higher interest rates upon refinancing  our interest expense would increase  which might affect our ability to make distributions to our stockholders 
we utilize interest rate swaps and caps to fix interest rates on variable rate debt and reduce certain exposures to interest rate fluctuations 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
we have a policy of only entering into contracts with major financial institutions based upon their credit ratings and other factors 
when viewed in conjunction with the underlying and offsetting exposure that the derivatives are designed to hedge  we have not sustained a material loss from those instruments nor do we anticipate any material adverse effect on our net income or financial position in the future from the use of derivatives 
to manage interest rate risk  we may employ options  forwards  interest rate swaps  caps and floors or a combination thereof depending on the underlying exposure 
we may employ swaps  forwards or purchased options to hedge qualifying forecasted transactions 
gains and losses related to these transactions are deferred and recognized in net income as interest expense in the same period or periods that the underlying transaction occurs  expires or is otherwise terminated 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which was required to be adopted in years beginning after june  we adopted the new statement effective january  the statement requires us to recognize all derivatives on the balance sheet at fair value 
derivatives that are not hedges must be adjusted to fair value through income 
if the derivative is a hedge  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of derivatives will either be offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities  or firm commitments through earnings or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedge item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of a derivative s change in fair value will be immediately recognized in earnings 
in september  we entered into a month  million interest rate cap with a strike of that has been designated as a cash flow hedge 
under the terms of the cap agreement  when libor exceeds  the counterparty will pay us million multiplied by the difference between libor and times the number of days when libor exceeds 
the unrealized gain loss in the fair value of cash flow hedges are reported on the balance sheet with corresponding adjustments to accumulated other comprehensive income 
on december   the million interest rate cap was reported at its fair value as an other asset of million 
an adjustment of million to other comprehensive income was made for the change in fair value of this cap during over the next twelve months  million is expected to be reclassified to earnings from other comprehensive income 
as of september  we terminated two interest rate swaps with notional amounts of million each 
under the terms of the first swap agreement  which would have expired in december  we received payments when libor exceeded and paid the counterparty when libor was less than 
this interest rate swap was extended in december to december at the option of the counterparty and therefore did not qualify for hedge accounting under fasb no 
the fair value of this swap at december  and december  was and million  respectively 
under the second swap agreement  which was scheduled to expire december   we received payments when libor exceeded and paid the counterparty when libor was less than 
the fair value of this interest rate swap at december  and december  was a liability of and million  respectively 
the change in fair value in was included in other comprehensive income as required under fasb no 
for fully effective cash flow hedges 
the fair values of these interest rate swaps were included in accrued expenses and other liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet at december
