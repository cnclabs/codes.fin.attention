item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties 
when used in this annual report on form k  the words intend  anticipate  believe  estimate  plan and expect and similar expressions as they relate to abgenix are included to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results and the timing of certain events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth below and under additional factors that might affect future results set forth in item of part i of this annual report on form k and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we are a biopharmaceutical company that develops and intends to manufacture and commercialize antibody therapeutic products for the treatment of a variety of disease conditions 
we have proprietary technologies that facilitate rapid generation of highly specific  fully human antibody product candidates that bind to disease targets appropriate for antibody therapy 
we developed our xenomouse technology  a technology utilizing genetically modified mice to generate fully human antibodies  and we also own a technology that enables the rapid identification of antibodies with desired function and characteristics  referred to as slam technology 
in our newly developed xenomax technology  we use slam technology to select and isolate antibodies with particular function and characteristics from antibody producing cells generated by xenomouse animals 
we intend to use our technologies to build a large and diversified product portfolio that we expect to develop and commercialize through licensing arrangements with pharmaceutical companies and others  through joint development and through internal product development programs 
results of operations years ended december   and contract revenues 
contract revenues totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
because they depend to a large extent on the success or failure of research and development efforts undertaken by our collaborators and licensees  our year to year contract revenues can fluctuate significantly and are inherently difficult to predict 
with our new manufacturing facility and our existing pilot plant  we are now offering integrated process sciences and manufacturing services  which we refer to as production services 
we expect total contract revenues in to be at similar levels as  with a new contribution from production services and a lesser contribution from product development 
over the next few years  we expect revenue from production services to increase  and over the next several years we expect revenue from product development to decrease 
the primary components of contract revenues for all periods were as follows technology licensing we recognized a total of million  million and million in  and  respectively  from licensing our proprietary technologies 
revenues consisted primarily of the following celltech r d ltd 
in each of and  we recognized million under an agreement with celltech in which we granted a license of our slam technology 
we received payments totaling million in the fourth quarter of representing a research license fee and service fees for the transfer of technology  net of million in shared closing costs 
we recognized these fees over the six month period ended march   during which we fulfilled our obligations to provide celltech with the applicable protocols  technical information  and training to enable celltech to effectively utilize the slam technology 
millennium pharmaceuticals in  we recognized research and license fees of million under an agreement with millennium in which we granted several licenses to make  use and sell antibodies generated with xenomouse technology 
we recognized these fees ratably each month over the ten month period ended december  during this period we fulfilled our obligation to assist in establishing the technology at millennium 
in  under an amendment to the agreement  we recognized million for the grant of additional product licenses to make  use and sell antibodies generated with xenomouse technology 
japan tobacco in  we recognized license fees of million under agreements related to the license of certain technologies to japan tobacco in the technologies were completed and delivered in additionally  in  and we recognized various fees  such as research license and service fees  product license fees  product development and research milestone payments  and option fees  under agreements related to the licensing of our xenomouse technology 
these revenues were generated from several collaborators  but were primarily from pfizer  curagen and amgen 
proprietary product development we recognized a total of million  million and million in  and  respectively  pursuant to our joint development and commercialization agreements for the development of abx egf and abx cbl 
in  and  these revenues included reimbursement of development costs 
in and  these revenues also included milestone and license fees 
the license fees were recognized ratably over the contractual performance periods 
under the abx egf agreement  this was the month period ended december  under the abx cbl agreement  this was the month period ended january  interest and other income 
interest and other income consist primarily of interest from cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest and other income totaled million in  million in and million in the decreases were due to lower interest rates and lower average cash  marketable securities and cash equivalent balances 
we expect interest income to decrease in future periods  as average cash balances decrease 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in management separates research and development expenditures into amounts related to pre clinical research and development  amounts related to clinical development programs and amounts related to facilities as follows preclinical research and development costs preclinical research and development costs include costs associated with preclinical research  development and testing of our product candidates  such as the costs of abgenix personnel  costs charged by outside contractors and the costs of technology in licensing 
research costs increased to million in from million in and from million in the increase was due to the increased level of product development activities  including activities related to new target validation  process sciences and bioinformatics 
additionally  the increase was due to development of new technology including our slam technology 
in  the increase was also due to increased expenditures for cell culture  purification  quality assurance and quality control functions related to clinical trial supplies 
major components of the increases in and were as follows costs of abgenix personnel costs of abgenix personnel to support preclinical research and development activities increased in from and in from in addition  the increase in as compared to included the additional personnel costs resulting from our acquisition of abgenix biopharma  our canadian subsidiary acquired in november personnel costs primarily include salary  fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs 
cost of outside contractors the increases in preclinical research and development costs in and included costs associated with the development of cell lines for our product candidates  primarily performed by an outside contractor  lonza biologics 
in  the increase included a million charge in the second quarter of related to an option fee 
the option was for the right to enter into exclusive negotiations with lonza for an additional manufacturing supply agreement 
after evaluation of our capacity needs  we notified lonza that we had decided to discontinue negotiations  and therefore expensed the option fee  which had previously been capitalized 
in  we incurred a charge of approximately million to reserve manufacturing capacity by acquiring an option to negotiate a supply agreement with a contract manufacturer 
we exercised the option and executed the five year manufacturing supply agreement in december additionally  in we entered into an agreement with impath inc under which impath evaluated target expression by performing certain tissue studies  enabling us to better identify potential diagnostic and therapeutic products 
the services were provided over the thirteen month period ended april third party development in and  we paid fees to gliatech related to pre clinical studies 
gliatech is performing under an agreement with us for the development and commercialization of fully human antibody therapeutic candidates against the complement protein properdin 
in licensing fees included in were technology in licensing fees of million paid to immunogen for providing the company with non exclusive access to immunogen s maytansinoid tumor activated prodrug technology 
under the agreement with immunogen  future payments are due if certain milestones are met and royalties are due on net sales of any resulting products 
additionally  in and  we paid fees to genzyme transgenics corporation related to research genzyme is performing in which genzyme agreed to produce our antibody product candidate  abx il  using its own manufacturing system 
clinical costs clinical costs include costs of conducting clinical trials  such as research fees and drug supply costs charged by outside contractors and costs of abgenix personnel 
clinical costs were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the decrease in compared to was primarily due to the decrease in the clinical trials being conducted for abx il the increase in compared to was due to the initiation of new clinical trials and the progression to later stage clinical trials for three of our product candidates  abx il  abx egf and abx cbl 
pursuant to our joint development agreements  we share equally in the costs of developing and commercializing abx egf with amgen and immunex and abx cbl with sangstat 
in february  we completed a preliminary analysis of the phase clinical trial of abx cbl and concluded that the study did not meet its primary endpoint 
therefore  we and sangstat do not plan any further development of abx cbl 
overall  we expect costs associated with conducting clinical trials in to be comparable to these costs in as we and our co developers  amgen and immunex  initiate new trials and add patients to our existing abx egf clinical trials  offset partially by decreases related to discontinuing clinical trials being conducted for abx il and abx cbl 
major components of the changes in and were as follows clinical research fees and drug supply costs clinical research fees  including clinical investigator site fees  monitoring costs and data management costs  and drug supply costs decreased in from and increased in from the decrease in was primarily due to the winding down of clinical trials for abx il beginning in the second quarter of  partially offset by a million charge in the second quarter of for previously capitalized clinical trial supplies for abx il and by a million charge in the fourth quarter of for previously capitalized clinical trial supplies for abx egf due to the decision to use a new manufacturing methodology for certain future clinical trials 
costs of abgenix personnel costs of abgenix personnel to support clinical activities decreased in from and increased in from personnel costs primarily include salary  fringe benefits  recruiting and relocation costs 
facility costs facility costs allocated to research and development increased to million in from million in and million in in order to accommodate our increased personnel and research and development activities  we acquired new facilities and related leasehold improvements  furniture and fixtures 
as a result  all of our facility related costs  primarily personnel costs  rent  and depreciation  increased from year to year 
we expect facility costs allocated to research and development to increase in future periods as a result of our recent capital expansion 
we expect that the primary sources of this increase will be related to operating our new manufacturing facility 
in the past  we have not tracked our historical research and development costs by project  rather  we have tracked such costs by the type of cost incurred  including costs in the categories discussed above preclinical research and development costs  clinical costs and facility costs 
for this reason  we cannot accurately estimate with any degree of certainty our historical costs for any particular research and development project 
goodwill and amortization of identified intangible assets 
our identified intangible assets consist primarily of existing technology including patents and certain royalty rights we acquired through the acquisitions of hesed biomed in  abgenix biopharma and intraimmune in  and jt america s interest in xenotech in amortization of intangible assets totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
beginning january   upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill  but will perform impairment tests annually  or earlier if indications of impairment exist 
we have conducted an initial and an annual impairment test on our goodwill in and concluded that no impairment charge was required 
the amortization of goodwill was million and  in and  respectively 
all other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
the decrease in amortization in from was a result of ceasing to amortize goodwill  partially offset by the full year s amortization of the new technology acquired in the hesed biomed acquisition 
the increase in amortization in from was a result of the acquisitions in and general and administrative expenses 
general and administrative expenses include compensation  professional services  consulting and other expenses related to information systems  legal  finance  and an allocation of facility costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in and from million in the primary reason for the increase in as compared to  was the increase in consulting and personnel expenses related to our information systems  including the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system 
another significant reason for the increase was the depreciation expense related to the enterprise resource planning system  which was launched at the beginning of the third quarter of the increase in compared to primarily reflected increased personnel  legal  and consulting costs in support of the increased activities of the company  which have included costs associated with building the infrastructure for human resources and recruiting efforts  finance and information systems and our legal department 
the increase in also reflected the general and administrative costs associated with abgenix biopharma  our canadian subsidiary acquired in november we expect personnel  consulting  professional services and other administrative costs to approximate the same levels in as in restructuring charges 
in october  we announced a restructuring plan  which consisted primarily of a reduction in employees 
a restructuring charge of million was recorded in to account for severance  medical and other benefits associated with this restructuring 
as of december   approximately million of severance benefits were accrued and are expected to be paid to terminated employees over the next nine months 
on an annual basis  we expect the reduction in salaries cost associated with this restructuring to be approximately million 
impairment of investments 
we purchased an aggregate amount of million of common stock of curagen and immunogen as strategic investments 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the curagen and immunogen investments are designated as available for sale and are reported at fair value on our balance sheet 
unrealized holding gains and losses for available for sale securities generally are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of stockholders equity 
however  if a decline in the fair value of available for sale securities is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down is included in earnings as an impairment charge 
under our accounting policy  marketable equity securities are presumed to be impaired if their fair value is less than their cost basis for more than six months  absent compelling evidence to the contrary 
during  our investments in curagen and immunogen common stock had traded below their original cost basis for more than six months  and therefore we deemed that an impairment of these investments had occurred 
accordingly  we recorded impairment charges totaling million in the year ended december   which were based on the differences between the market price and cost basis or new adjusted cost basis of these securities 
as of december   these investments were recorded at fair value in long term investments on the balance sheet  and any net unrealized holding gains and losses  to the extent not recognized as an impairment charge as discussed above  are reported as a component of stockholders equity 
if we deem these investments further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur an additional impairment charge on these investments 
in addition  we invested million in mds proteomics  a privately held company  in connection with the collaboration with that company 
because mds proteomics is a private company and its securities are not publicly traded  the value of our investment is inherently more difficult to estimate than an investment in a publicly traded company 
in  we estimated that the value of our investment had declined to million and that an impairment of our investment had occurred 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million in the year ended december  the amount of the charge was based on the difference between the estimated value as determined by our management and our original cost basis 
as of december   the cost basis of this investment reflected the new estimated value at june   which is recorded in long term investments on the balance sheet 
if we deem the investment in mds proteomics further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur an additional impairment charge on this investment 
in process research and development 
the in process research and development charge of million in relates to our acquisition of abgenix biopharma 
we accounted for this acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
the total purchase price was million  including transaction costs 
we performed a valuation in which we allocated the total purchase price of abgenix biopharma among the acquired assets 
we used the income approach to develop the value for the existing technology and the in process research and development  as applicable 
the income approach incorporates the calculation of the present value of future economic benefits such as cash earnings  cost savings  and tax deductions 
the rate utilized to discount the net cash flows to their present value was 
we utilized the cost approach to value the assembled workforce 
the cost approach measures the benefits related to an asset by the cost to reconstruct or replace it with another of like utility 
abgenix biopharma s slam technology is patented in the united states and patent applications are pending in canada and europe 
slam is technologically feasible and we have licensed the technology to a customer 
at the time of our acquisition of abgenix biopharma  its assembled workforce was comprised of employees  primarily scientists  with specific experience and knowledge of the abgenix biopharma slam technology and other technologies in process 
the combined allocated value of these two intangible assets is million 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 assembled workforce no longer met the definition of an intangible asset 
as a result  the net balance for assembled workforce was reclassified as goodwill 
abgenix biopharma s primary in process research and development activities focused on two efforts agonist antibodies and antibodies that induce apoptosis 
agonist antibodies trigger a biological process  rather than simply block a biological pathway 
antibodies that induce apoptosis trigger a process that cause the death of the cell they bind to  for use in treating diseases like cancer 
we estimated these two efforts to be and complete as of the date of acquisition  based on the estimated costs to complete of approximately  and  respectively 
remaining efforts on these projects are significant and include most phases of product design  development and testing 
as a result of the developmental work and additional testing required to produce these products in accordance with all clinical  technical and functional specifications of the fda and other governmental authorities  these products have yet to achieve technological feasibility 
as such  at the date of the acquisition the in process technology had no alternative future use and did not otherwise qualify for capitalization 
the value assigned to each acquired in process research and development project is million for agonist antibodies and million for antibodies that induce apoptosis 
the estimates used in valuing in process research and development were based upon assumptions believed to be reasonable but which are inherently uncertain and unpredictable 
assumptions may be incomplete or inaccurate  and unanticipated events and circumstances may occur 
accordingly  actual results may vary from the projected results 
any such variance may result in a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
interest expense 
interest expense was related to interest and amortization of issuance costs on our convertible debt  and interest on our equipment leaseline financing and loan facility 
interest expense increased to million in from  in and  in the increase was primarily due to our issuance of million of convertible debt in march  which accrues interest at an annual rate of  payable semi annually and on which the first interest payment was made on september  interest expense of million related to the convertible debt was capitalized in for each future annual period  we expect to pay approximately million of interest related to our convertible debt until the debt matures  until we redeem or repurchase the debt or until all or part of the debt is converted into shares of our common stock 
liquidity and capital resources at december   we had cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities of approximately million 
in march  we received proceeds of approximately million  net of commissions  from our issuance of million of convertible debt 
we invest our cash equivalents and marketable securities primarily in highly liquid  interest bearing  investment grade and government securities in order to preserve principal 
we have also invested in certain marketable equity securities of immunogen and curagen for strategic reasons 
these securities had a fair value of million at december  cash used in operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
this reflects an increase of million in and an increase of million in the increases reflected primarily the following an increase of million and million in and  respectively  in funding of research and development and manufacturing costs related to the development of new products 
an increase of million and million in and  respectively  in general and administrative expenses primarily related to an increase in consulting and personnel expenses related to our information systems  including the implementation of a new enterprise resource planning system 
a decrease of million in and an increase of million in in cash from interest income 
the decrease in was due to lower interest rates and lower average cash balances 
the increase in was due to the receipt of previously accrued interest income on proceeds from the follow on public offering in a decrease of million in and an increase of million in in customer payments 
the decrease in was due primarily to a decrease in contract revenues 
both the decrease in and the increase in were affected by the timing of payments received under our contracts 
an increase of million in in payments  which reduced accounts payable and accrued liabilities  as compared to a decrease of million in in payments  which increased accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash provided by used in investing activities 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in net cash used in investing activities was million and million in and  respectively 
cash was provided by and used in investing activities primarily as follows capital expenditures of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the expenditures in reflect primarily investment in leasehold improvements  construction in progress and equipment for our new manufacturing facility and leasehold improvements in our new research and development facilities 
additionally  they reflect investments in computer hardware and software  including the acquisition of a new enterprise resource planning system 
the expenditures in and reflect primarily investment in leasehold improvements in our new office facility  construction in progress for the new process sciences laboratory and manufacturing facility  and investments in computer hardware and software 
maturities and sales  net of purchases  of marketable securities of million and million in and  respectively 
in  the use reflected purchases  net of maturities  of marketable securities of million with the funds we received from follow on public offering and private placements in payments of million and million in and  respectively  on account of liabilities related to acquisitions 
in  the amount was primarily related to payments to the holders of abgenix biopharma special shares 
in  the amount included million to the holders of abgenix biopharma special shares and million for the buy out of certain stock options issued in connection with our acquisition of abgenix biopharma in november investment of million in mds proteomics inc in investments of million and million in immunogen and curagen  respectively  in payment of million in for the acquisition of intraimmune therapies  inc payments of million and million to our landlord in and  respectively  as the initial and final disbursements under a loan agreement entered into in august cash provided by financing activities 
net cash provided by financing activities was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in  cash provided by financing activities consisted of million net proceeds from our issuance of convertible subordinated notes  as described below  and million proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
in  cash provided by financing activities consisted of million proceeds from the exercise of stock options and the issuance of stock under our employee stock purchase plan  offset by million in payments on long term debt 
in  cash provided by financing activities consisted of million proceeds from the sale of  shares of our common stock in a follow on public offering in february and from the sale of  shares of our common stock in a private placement in november  million proceeds from cell genesys for the exercise of warrants  and million from the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan  offset by million in payments on long term debt 
in march  we issued million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share subject to certain adjustments 
the notes accrue interest at an annual rate of and we are obligated to pay interest on march and september of each year 
we made our first interest payment of million on september  the notes will mature on march  and are redeemable at our option on or after march   or earlier if the price of our common stock exceeds specified levels 
in addition  the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes if we undergo a change in control 
proceeds from the sale of the notes  net of commissions payable to the initial purchasers of the notes but before subtracting other offering expenses payable by us  were million 
in march and february  we obtained stand by letters of credit for million and million  respectively  from a commercial bank as security for our obligations under two facility leases 
these were increased in january to and million  respectively  in connection with amendments to our facility leases 
in september  we obtained a stand by letter of credit for million canadian dollars from a commercial bank as security for our obligations under a facility lease in canada 
the stand by letters of credit are secured by an investment account  in which we must maintain a million balance 
additionally  in we leased million of our laboratory and office equipment from a financing company 
the lease bore interest at approximately to  and matured in september we also had a construction financing line with a bank in the amount of million that was used to finance construction of leasehold improvements at our first facility 
we paid off the line in may financing uncertainties related to our business plan 
we plan to continue to make significant expenditures to establish and staff our own manufacturing facility and support our research and development activities  including pre clinical product development and clinical trials 
in october  we announced a restructuring plan  consisting primarily of a reduction in employees 
as a result of that plan we incurred a restructuring charge of million in the fourth quarter of we also intend to continue to look for opportunities to acquire new technology through in licensing  collaborations or acquisitions 
during  we estimate that we will spend approximately million on leasehold improvements and equipment to complete our new manufacturing and research and development facilities 
additionally  during the same period we expect to spend up to approximately million on new computer hardware and software 
we currently intend to use our available cash on hand to finance these projects and business developments  but we might also pursue other financing alternatives  such as a bank line of credit  funding by one ore more collaborators or a mortgage financing  that may become available to us 
whether we use cash on hand or choose to obtain financing will depend on  among other things  the future success of our business  the prevailing interest rate environment and the condition of financial markets generally 
the amounts of the expenditures that will be necessary to execute our business plan are subject to numerous uncertainties  which may adversely affect our liquidity and capital resources to a significant extent 
four of our proprietary product candidates  abx egf  abx ma  abx cbl and abx il  are in various stages of clinical trials 
we are discontinuing development of two of them  abx il and abx cbl 
completion of clinical trials may take several years or more  but the length of time generally varies substantially according to the type  complexity  novelty and intended use of a product candidate 
we estimate that clinical trials of the type we generally conduct are typically completed over the following timelines clinical phase estimated completion period phase years phase years phase years however  the duration and the cost of clinical trials may vary significantly over the life of a project as a result of differences arising during the clinical trials  including  among others  the following the number of patients that ultimately participate in the trial  the duration of patient follow up that seems appropriate in view of the results  the number of clinical sites included in the trials  and the length of time required to enroll suitable patient subjects 
we test our potential product candidates in numerous pre clinical studies to identify disease indications for which they may be product candidates 
we may conduct multiple clinical trials to cover a variety of indications for each product candidate 
as we obtain results from trials  we may elect to discontinue clinical trials for certain product candidates or for one or more indications for a given product candidate in order to focus our resources on more promising product candidates or indications 
for example  in january and may  we announced that clinical trials of our proprietary product candidate abx il as a treatment for rheumatoid arthritis and psoriasis  respectively  did not support further clinical studies of that product candidate 
additionally in february  we announced that the clinical trial of our proprietary product candidate  abx cbl as a treatment for graft versus host disease  did not support further clinical studies of that product candidate 
the failure of clinical trials can also result in additional research and development expenses 
for example  we recorded a charge of million for the three months ended june   related to our decision in the second quarter of to wind down our clinical trials of abx il an important element of our business strategy is to pursue the research and development of a diverse range of product candidates for a variety of disease indications 
we also intend to enter co development agreements  similar to our agreements with amgen and immunex for abx egf and sangstat for abx cbl  and enter into additional joint development agreements earlier in the development lifecycle of product candidates than we did in our existing co development agreements 
our strategy is designed to diversify the risks associated with our research and development spending 
the decisions to terminate or wind down our clinical programs for developing abx il and abx cbl have reduced the diversity of our product portfolio 
we believe that this effect is temporary  in view of the number of potential product candidates we have in preclinical development 
to the extent  however  that we are unable to maintain a diverse and broad range of product candidates  our dependence on the success of one or a few product candidates would increase 
our proprietary product candidates also have not yet achieved fda regulatory approval  which is required before we can market them as therapeutic products 
in order to proceed to subsequent clinical trial stages and to ultimately achieve regulatory approval  the fda must conclude that our clinical data establish safety and efficacy 
historically  the results from preclinical testing and early clinical trials have often not been predictive of results obtained in later clinical trials 
a number of new drugs and biologics have shown promising results in clinical trials  but subsequently failed to establish sufficient safety and efficacy data to obtain necessary regulatory approvals 
furthermore  our business strategy includes the option of entering into arrangements with third parties to collaborate in the development and commercialization of our products 
in the event that third parties take over the clinical trial process for one of our product candidates  the estimated completion date would largely be under the control of that third party rather than us 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty which proprietary products or indications  if any  will be subject to future collaborative arrangements  in whole or in part  or the extent to which third parties may control clinical trials pursuant to such arrangements  and how such arrangements would affect our capital requirements 
as a result of the uncertainties discussed above  among others  the duration and completion costs of our research and development projects are difficult to estimate and are subject to considerable variation 
our inability to complete our research and development projects in a timely manner or our failure to enter into collaborative agreements  when appropriate  could significantly increase our capital requirements and could adversely impact our liquidity 
these uncertainties could force us to seek additional  external sources of financing from time to time in order to continue with our business strategy 
our inability to raise additional capital  or to do so on terms reasonably acceptable to us  would jeopardize the future success of our business 
we also may be required to make further substantial expenditures if unforeseen difficulties arise in other parts of our business 
in particular  our future liquidity and capital requirements also will depend on many factors other than our research and development activities  including the retention of existing and establishment of further collaboration  licensing  manufacturing and other agreements  if any  the cost of establishing and operating our manufacturing facility  the cost of conducting commercialization activities and arrangements  the time and expense involved in seeking regulatory approvals  competing technological and market developments  the time and expense of filing and prosecuting patent applications and enforcing or defending against patent claims  our investment in  or acquisition of  other companies  the amount of product in licensing in which we engage  and other factors not within our control 
we believe that our current cash balances  cash equivalents  marketable securities  and the cash generated from our licensing and other agreements will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least one year 
however  because of the uncertainties in our business discussed above  among others  we cannot assure you that this will be the case 
in addition  we may choose to  or prevailing business conditions may require us to  obtain additional financing from time to time 
we may choose to raise additional funds through public or private financing  licensing and other agreements or other arrangements 
we cannot be sure that any additional funding  if needed  will be available on terms favorable to us or at all 
furthermore  any additional equity or equity related financing may be dilutive to our stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may subject us to restrictive covenants 
we may also choose to obtain funding through collaborations  licensing and other contractual arrangements 
such agreements may require us to relinquish our rights to certain of our technologies  products or marketing territories 
our failure to raise capital when needed would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
history of net losses 
we have incurred net losses in each of the last five years of operation  including net losses of million in  million in  million in  million in and million in as of december   our accumulated deficit was million 
our losses to date have resulted principally from research and development costs relating to the development of our xenomouse and xenomax technologies and antibody therapeutic product candidates  costs associated with certain agreements with japan tobacco  inc and certain settlement and cross licensing agreements with genpharm international  inc  in process research and development costs and amortization of intangible assets associated with our acquisitions of hesed biomed  abgenix biopharma  intraimmune and japan tobacco s interest in xenotech  general and administrative costs relating to our operations  and impairment charges related to our strategic investments in curagen  immunogen and mds proteomics 
we expect to incur additional losses for the foreseeable future as a result of our research and development costs  including costs associated with conducting preclinical development and clinical trials  charges related to purchases of technology or other assets  and costs associated with establishing our manufacturing facilities 
we intend to invest significantly in our products prior to entering into licensing agreements 
this will increase our need for capital and will result in losses for at least the next several years 
we expect that the amount of operating losses will fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter as a result of increases or decreases in our research and development efforts  the execution or termination of licensing and other agreements  and the initiation  and success or failure  of clinical trials 
net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million 
our net operating loss carryforwards exclude losses incurred prior to our formation in july further  we have capitalized the amounts associated with the settlement and cross license that have been expensed for financial statement accounting purposes and we are amortizing those amounts over a period of approximately years for tax purposes 
the net operating loss and credit carryforwards will expire in the years through  if not utilized 
utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to a substantial annual limitation due to the change in ownership provisions of the internal revenue code of and similar state provisions 
the annual limitation may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits before utilization 
critical accounting policies the financial results that we report are impacted by the application of several accounting policies that require us to make subjective and complex judgments 
we are required to estimate the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
changes in our estimates or judgments could materially impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows in future years 
our significant accounting policies are described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in item of this annual report on form k 
we believe our most critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  accounting for our equity investments  accounting for goodwill  and accounting for clinical trial supplies 
revenue recognition 
we derive our contract revenue from license  option  service and milestone fees received from customers 
as described below  within the framework of generally accepted accounting principles  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and applied in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates  material differences could result in the amount and timing of our revenue in any period 
research and product license fees are generally recognized only after both the license period has commenced and the technology has been delivered 
however  if we are obligated to provide significant assistance to enable the customer to practice the license  then the revenue is recognized over the period of such obligation 
under some of our research and product license arrangements  the period of our obligation to provide significant assistance to the customer may not be contractually defined with an end date 
in these circumstances  we must exercise judgment in estimating the period of time over which certain deliverables  such as customer training  will be provided to enable the customer to practice the license 
option fees for granting options to obtain product licenses to develop a product are recognized when the option is exercised or when the option period expires  whichever occurs first 
if the option fee is commingled with the license fees in the contract  and if the fees related to the license are recognized as revenue up front  we estimate the relative fair value of the option component and recognize the revenue attributed to the option component separately in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
fees we receive for research services we perform are generally recognized ratably over the entire period we perform these services 
however  in the case of co development arrangements  fees we receive for research services we provide are recorded as revenue in the period they are rendered 
incentive milestone payments are recognized as revenue when the specified milestone is achieved 
incentive milestone payments are triggered either by the results of our research efforts or by events external to abgenix  such as regulatory approval to market a product 
incentive milestone payments are substantially at risk at the inception of the contract  and the values assigned thereto are commensurate with the type of milestone achieved 
upon achievement of an incentive milestone event  we have no future performance obligations related to the payment 
accounting for equity investments 
we are exposed to equity price risk on our strategic investments in curagen  immunogen and mds proteomics and we may elect to make additional similar investments in the future 
as of december   we had a carrying value of million in curagen common stock  which reflected the public trading price on that date of per share 
we also had a carrying value on december   of million in immunogen common stock  which reflected the public trading price on that date of per share 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these types of investments 
under sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  the curagen and immunogen investments are designated as available for sale and are reported at fair value on our balance sheet 
unrealized holding gains and losses on available for sale securities generally are excluded from earnings and reported as a component of stockholders equity 
however  if a decline in the fair value of available for sale securities is judged to be other than temporary  the cost basis of the security is written down to fair value as a new cost basis and the amount of the write down is included in earnings as an impairment charge 
under our accounting policy  marketable equity securities are presumed to be impaired if their fair value is less than their cost basis for more than six months  absent compelling evidence to the contrary 
we purchased million of curagen common stock in december at price of per share and million of curagen common stock in november at a price of per share 
we purchased million of immunogen common stock in september at a price of per share 
during  our investments in curagen and immunogen common stock had traded below their original cost basis for more than six months  and therefore we deemed that an impairment of these investments had occurred 
accordingly  we recorded impairment charges totaling million in the year ended december   which were based on the differences between the market price and cost basis or new adjusted cost basis of these securities 
as of december   these investments were recorded at fair value in long term investments on the balance sheet  and any net unrealized holding gains and losses  to the extent not recognized as an impairment charge as discussed above  were reported as a component of stockholders equity 
the public trading prices of the shares of both companies have fluctuated significantly since we purchased them and could continue to do so 
if these shares continue to trade below their new cost bases in future periods  we may incur additional impairment charges relating to these investments 
the amounts of these charges  if any  will equal our unrealized loss on these securities as of the end of the relevant periods 
in addition  we invested million in mds proteomics  a privately held company  in connection with our collaboration with that company 
because mds proteomics is a private company and its securities are not publicly traded  the value of our investment is inherently more difficult to estimate than an investment in a publicly traded company 
in  we estimated that the value of our investment had declined to million and that an impairment of our investment had occurred 
accordingly  we recorded an impairment charge of million on our investment in the year ended december  the amount of the charge was based on the difference between the estimated value as determined by our management and our original cost basis 
as of december   the cost basis of this investment reflected the new estimated value at june   which is recorded in long term investments on the balance sheet 
if we deem the investment in mds proteomics further impaired at the end of any future period  we may incur an additional impairment charge on this investment 
accounting for goodwill 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses the financial accounting and reporting standards for goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to their acquisition 
this accounting standard requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  and instead  be tested for impairment on a periodic basis 
under our accounting policy  we have adopted an annual goodwill impairment test date as of the beginning of the fourth quarter of following this approach  we use the carrying values available as of september  assess if they have a potential impairment  and complete the measurement of impairment  if required 
because we have determined that we have one reporting unit under sfas no 
 our market capitalization is considered to be a reasonable proxy for the fair value of the reporting unit 
however  the market capitalization is not the sole measure of the fair value of the reporting unit 
for a brief period during the fourth quarter of  our common stock had traded at a price that represented a market capitalization less than our book value 
however this condition did not persist for a significant portion of the fourth quarter of and as of december   our common stock had traded at a price that represented a market capitalization higher than our book value 
as of december   we determined that the fair value of the reporting unit was higher than its carrying value and an impairment charge was not recognized 
while a decline in stock price and market capitalization is not specifically cited in sfas no 
as a goodwill impairment indicator  we consider whether current business and market conditions suggest that the fair value of the reporting unit has likely declined below its carrying value 
if we determine that a potential impairment of our goodwill exists  we will perform the impairment measurement procedures under sfas no 
which may result in a charge for the impairment of goodwill in future periods 
furthermore  a change in our determination of reporting units may also result in a charge for the impairment of goodwill in future periods 
a change in the determination of reporting units may occur should we reorganize into reporting units for which each unit individually constitutes a business for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews the operating results of that unit 
as of december   the carrying value of our goodwill was approximately million 
accounting for clinical trial supplies 
we pay fees to outside contractors for the manufacture of our antibody therapeutic product candidates 
such fees are capitalized as prepaid expense if management determines that the clinical trial supplies have alternative future uses in clinical trials for multiple indications of a product candidate and are expensed upon the use of the materials  primarily as they are used in clinical trials 
we would immediately expense previously capitalized costs if the asset were not expected to have an alternative future use  such as use in a clinical trial 
in the second quarter of  as a result of our decision to wind down our clinical trials of abx il  we recorded a charge of million relating to clinical trial supplies that we had previously capitalized 
also  in the fourth quarter of  as a result of deciding to use a new methodology for manufacturing abx egf to be used for certain future clinical trials  we recorded a charge of million  relating to clinical trial supplies manufactured under the previous methodology 
as of december   the balance of prepaid clinical trial supplies was million 
we may incur additional expenses related to clinical supply writedowns depending on the outcome of ongoing clinical trials 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments future minimum payments for certain contractual obligations for years subsequent to december  are as follows total and thereafter in thousands contractual obligations operating leases      convertible debt   total      amounts represent total of minimum payments for the entire period 
in march  we issued million principal amount of convertible subordinated notes in a private placement 
the notes are convertible into shares of our common stock at a conversion price of per share subject to certain adjustments 
the notes accrue interest at an annual rate of  and we are obligated to pay interest on march and september of each year 
we made our first interest payment of million on september  the notes will mature on march  and are redeemable at our option on or after march   or earlier if the price of our common stock exceeds specified levels 
in addition  the holders of the notes may require us to repurchase the notes if we undergo a change in control 
therefore  in march  or earlier if we undergo a change in control  we may use a significant portion of our cash balance to repay the million principal amount of our convertible debt 
if our cash balance at any time is insufficient to meet our obligations under the notes  we would have to seek additional financing  if available  to support our obligations under the notes 
in addition  we expect to make interest payments on the notes of million per year for years of through  and million in  assuming all the notes remain outstanding until their maturity date 
other significant commercial commitments include the following purchase commitments totaling million to contractors related to the purchase of equipment and design and construction of our new manufacturing facility  a monthly suite fee of approximately million plus raw material charge to lonza for our exclusive use of a cell culture production suite within one of lonza s facilities over the five year contract term  which ends august  a commitment to share equally all the development costs for abx cbl pursuant to our joint development and commercialization agreement with sangstat 
development costs are determined by the development plan agreed upon by a joint steering committee 
we and sangstat share responsibility for product development 
in february  we and sangstat announced that because the phase clinical trial for abx cbl did not meet its primary endpoint we would discontinue further development of abx cbl  an annual maintenance fee of  for our exclusive worldwide rights to commercialize abx cbl 
in addition  we must commit at least million annually to the development of abx cbl until abx cbl receives regulatory approval as a commercial product in any country and to pay royalties on potential product sales 
if we fail to fulfill this commitment  we could lose the cbl license and not be able to continue the development of abx cbl 
our obligations under the cbl license agreement are subject to our discretionary right to terminate the agreement 
we and our co developer  sangstat  announced in february our decision to discontinue further development of abx cbl  a commitment to share equally all development costs for abx egf pursuant to our joint development and commercialization agreement with amgen and immunex 
development costs are determined by the development plan agreed upon by a joint steering committee 
we share responsibility for product development with amgen and immunex  and research and development and pre launch marketing commitments to gliatech of at least million annually  including approximately million over the ten month period ending october   for pre clinical studies  in connection with a license  development and commercialization agreement 
in addition  we have committed to make payments for the achievement of certain development milestones and to pay royalties based on potential product sales  if any 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring  discontinued operations  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december   and earlier adoption is encouraged 
we adopted sfas no 
in the fourth quarter of due to the nature of our restructuring activities in  the impact of the adoption was not material 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas no 
to be significant to the results of operations for the years after in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have certain agreements with customers and collaborators that contain indemnification provisions 
pursuant to such provisions  we typically indemnify the customer or collaborator against certain third party claims 
we are not aware of any facts that would be likely to give rise to an adverse judgment under these indemnification provisions 
in november  the fasb issued emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a company for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf issue no 
addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
may have on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk 
the company is exposed to interest rate sensitivity on its investments in debt securities and its outstanding fixed rate debt 
the objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal  while at the same time maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
to achieve this objective  we invest in highly liquid  investment grade and government debt securities 
our investments in debt securities are subject to interest rate risk 
to minimize the exposure due to an adverse shift in interest rates  we invest in short term securities and our goal is to maintain an average maturity of approximately one year 
in addition  during the company has million of outstanding convertible subordinated notes due in the fair value of these convertible subordinated notes may fluctuate with changes in market interest rates  as well as changes in the market price of our common stock 
a hypothetical per annum decrease in interest rates as of december  would have an adverse net change in the fair value of our interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities of approximately million 
a hypothetical per annum increase in interest rates as of december  would have an adverse net change in the fair value of our interest rate sensitive assets of approximately million 
equity price risk 
we are exposed to equity price risk on strategic investments  such as those we have made in curagen  immunogen and mds proteomics 
we typically do not attempt to reduce or eliminate our market exposure on these securities 
with respect to curagen and immunogen  each of whose common stock is publicly traded  the market price of these securities was approximately million and million as of december  and  respectively 
due to decreases in the market price  we recorded impairment charges of million in related to our investments in curagen and immunogen 
the trading prices of shares of curagen and immunogen have fluctuated significantly since we purchased these securities 
each additional decrease in market value of these securities would result in a decrease in value of approximately million from the fair value of those investments at december  additional price declines could cause us to record additional impairment charges in future periods 
an adverse movement of equity market prices generally would also have an impact on the valuation of our non publicly traded strategic equity securities  such as mds proteomics 
such a movement and the related underlying economic conditions would negatively impact the prospects of any company we invest in  its ability to raise capital and the likelihood of our being able to realize our investment through liquidity events such as a public offering  merger or private sale 
in  we incurred a million charge related to a write down of our investment in mds proteomics  and we may incur future writedowns of these securities 
at december   our strategic investment in mds proteomics had a carrying amount of million
