item legal proceedings shareholder litigation on february   a class action  pifko v 
thomas betts corp  et al pifko  was commenced in the united states district court for the western district of tennessee 
the action asserted claims under rule b and section of the securities and exchange act of against the corporation and its former chief executive officer and chief financial officer 
the complaint alleged that the corporation issued false and misleading quarterly reports and press releases for the first and third quarters of the allegations were based on the corporation s announcement on november  that accounting errors had been discovered requiring a restatement of results for those two quarters 
plaintiff filed an amended complaint in june  adding several new class representatives 
the amended complaint repeated the claims in the original complaint and added allegations concerning certain transactions which were alleged to have been improper or in violation of generally accepted accounting principles 
on august   the corporation issued a press release announcing material accounting charges to be taken in the second quarter following issuance of the press release  plaintiffs counsel requested that the oral argument on defendants motion to dismiss be canceled and that they be given time to replead to include allegations incorporating the matters disclosed in the august press release 
the court granted their request 
before the second amended pleading in pifko was served  a new federal securities law class action  nuckowski v 
thomas betts corp  et al nuckowski was filed in the same court 
nuckowski asserted claims on behalf of a proposed class of purchasers of thomas betts common stock between february and august  like pifko  the claims were based on alleged violations of rule b and section of the securities and exchange act of the complaint essentially incorporated the disclosures in the august press release and alleged that defendants knowingly or recklessly released financial statements and press releases which failed to disclose the matters covered in the august press release 
in september  plaintiffs in the pifko action filed a second amended class action complaint to expand the class period to cover all purchasers from the original class inception date  april   through august  it also added allegations related to information contained in the august press release 
on december   the court issued an order consolidating all the related cases into a single action  and appointing lead plaintiffs 
in accordance with the order  the plaintiffs filed a consolidated complaint on january  the consolidated complaint essentially repeated the allegations in the earlier complaints described above 
on march   defendants moved to dismiss the consolidated complaint 
before any argument on that motion occurred  however  plaintiffs indicated to the court an intention to file a related complaint arising from the same events against the corporation s auditors  kpmg llp kpmg  a complaint which defendants did file on july  kpmg subsequently moved to dismiss the complaint 
in an opinion dated april   the court denied the page of 
table of contents corporation s motion to dismiss  granted in part and denied in part the motion to dismiss on behalf of the individual defendants  and granted the motion to dismiss by kpmg 
the corporation and the plaintiffs subsequently agreed to retain a mediator to assist with settlement negotiations 
the court agreed to a brief adjournment to allow the mediation to occur 
the mediation was conducted on september   and based on agreements reached  the parties signed a memorandum of understanding shortly thereafter settling all claims in the action against the corporation and the individual defendants 
the corporation also reached agreement with its insurance carriers regarding their contributions to the settlement 
pursuant to the agreed terms  the corporation and its insurers contributed million of which approximately million was paid by the corporation and the balance by the insurers to a settlement fund for the benefit of the plaintiff class 
the terms of the memorandum of understanding were incorporated into a stipulation of settlement  which received preliminary approval from the court on november  after notice to the class  the court held a final hearing and approved the settlement on december  at the hearing  the court entered judgment dismissing all claims in the action against the corporation and the individual defendants 
no appeals were filed within the time allowed 
the settlement is now final 
sec investigation soon after issuing the august  press release announcing substantial charges in the second fiscal quarter of  the corporation received an informal request for information regarding the basis of the charges from the staff of the securities and exchange commission enforcement division 
in response  the corporation collected and produced the bulk of the documents requested and various former and current employees were interviewed telephonically by the commission s staff 
on january   the commission issued a formal order of investigation and subsequently has required the production of additional documents  conducted interviews and taken the testimony of current and former employees 
the staff has advised the corporation that it intends to recommend an enforcement action against the corporation and certain individuals 
the corporation has initiated meetings and conversations with the staff regarding the proposed charges and their possible resolution 
the corporation believes it has reached agreement with the staff regarding the form of a consent order  which must then be approved by the commission 
if the proposed settlement now being finalized is approved  it would provide for injunctive relief against future violations by the corporation  and would not require the corporation to make any monetary payment 
the proposed settlement is not expected to have a material impact on the corporation s operations or financial condition 
kaiser litigation by july   kaiser aluminum  its property insurers  kaiser injured workers  nearby businesses and  residents near the kaiser facility in louisiana certified as a class  filed product liability and business interruption cases against the corporation and six other defendants in louisiana state court seeking damages in excess of million 
these cases alleged that a thomas betts cable tie mounting base failed thereby allowing bundled cables to come in contact with a kv energized bus bar 
this alleged electrical fault supposedly initiated a series of events culminating in an explosion  which leveled acres of the kaiser facility 
page of 
table of contents a seven week trial in the fall resulted in a jury verdict in favor of the corporation 
however  months later  the trial court overturned that verdict in granting plaintiffs judgment notwithstanding the verdict motions 
on december   the trial court judge found the thomas betts product  an adhesive backed mounting base  to be unreasonably dangerous and therefore assigned fault to t b 
the judge set the damages for the injured workers at million and the damages for kaiser at million 
the corporation s allocation is million  plus legal interest 
the corporation has appealed this ruling 
management believes there are meritorious defenses to the claim and intends to contest the litigation vigorously 
the appeal required a bond in the amount of million the judgment plus legal interest 
plaintiffs successfully moved the trial court to increase the bond to million 
nonetheless  the corporation s liability insurers have secured the million bond 
the corporation has insurance coverage for this claim 
if the judgment of million is upheld  it would be within insurance policy limits  therefore  management does not expect this claim to have a material impact on the corporation s results of operations or financial condition 
other legal matters the corporation is also involved in legal proceedings and litigation arising in the ordinary course of business

critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements contained in this report requires the use of estimates and assumptions to determine certain amounts reported as net sales  costs  expenses  page of 
table of contents assets or liabilities and certain amounts disclosed as contingent assets or liabilities 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates or assumptions 
the corporation s significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
management believes the corporation s critical accounting policies include revenue recognition  inventory valuation  goodwill and other intangible assets  long lived assets  income taxes  and environmental costs 
revenue recognition the corporation recognizes revenue in accordance with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin no 
the corporation recognizes revenue when finished products are shipped to unaffiliated customers and both title and risks of ownership are transferred 
sales discounts  quantity and price rebates  allowances and warranty costs are estimated based on contractual commitments and experience and recorded in the period in which the sale is recognized 
certain customers have the right to return goods under certain circumstances and those returns  which are reasonably estimable  are accrued at the time of shipment 
management analyzes historical returns and allowances  current economic trends and specific customer circumstances when evaluating the adequacy of accounts receivable related reserves and accruals 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using the first in  first out fifo method 
to ensure inventories are carried at the lower of cost or market  the corporation periodically evaluates the carrying value of its inventories 
the corporation also periodically performs an evaluation of inventory for excess and obsolete items 
such evaluations are based on management s judgment and use of estimates 
such estimates incorporate inventory quantities on hand  aging of the inventory  sales forecasts for particular product groupings  planned dispositions of product lines and overall industry trends 
goodwill and other intangible assets the corporation follows the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires a transitional and annual test of goodwill and indefinite lived assets associated with reporting units for indications of impairment 
the corporation performed its transitional test of goodwill as of the beginning of and expects to perform its annual impairment assessment in the fourth quarter of each year  unless circumstances dictate more frequent assessments 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 each test of goodwill requires the corporation to determine the fair value of each reporting unit  and compare the fair value to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and the corporation must perform a second more detailed impairment assessment 
the second impairment assessment involves allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its recognized and unrecognized assets and liabilities in order to determine the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill as of the assessment date 
the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is then compared to the carrying amount of goodwill to quantify an impairment charge as of the assessment date 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for information regarding the impairment charge of million recorded in as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
and other transitional disclosure information 
long lived assets the corporation adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets on december  page of 
table of contents sfas no 
establishes accounting standards for the impairment of long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and intangible assets subject to amortization 
for purposes of recognizing and measuring impairment of long lived assets  the corporation evaluates assets for associated product groups 
the corporation reviews long lived assets to be held and used for impairment annually or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of the assets may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the undiscounted expected future cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset in the associated product groups is less than the carrying amount of the assets  the assets are considered to be impaired 
impairment losses are measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
when fair values are not available  the corporation estimates fair value using the expected future cash flows discounted at a rate commensurate with the risks associated with the recovery of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
adopting sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the corporation s consolidated financial statements 
prior to the december  adoption of sfas no 
 the corporation had assets held for sale  which under the transitional provisions of that pronouncement  have been accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
under provisions of sfas no 
 depreciation on assets held for sale  which would have been million for  was discontinued as of december  see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes the corporation uses the asset and liability method of accounting for income taxes 
this method recognizes the expected future tax consequences of temporary differences between book and tax bases of assets and liabilities and provides a valuation allowance based on a more likely than not criteria 
the corporation has valuation allowances for deferred tax assets primarily associated with operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards and deferred state income tax assets 
realization of the deferred tax assets is dependent upon the corporation s ability to generate sufficient future taxable income and  if necessary  execution of its tax planning strategies 
management believes that it is more likely than not that future taxable income  based on enacted tax law in effect as of december   will be sufficient to realize the recorded deferred tax assets net of existing valuation allowances 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies  which involve estimates and uncertainties  in making this assessment 
tax planning strategies include primarily sales of non core assets 
projected future taxable income is based on management s forecast of the operating results of the corporation 
management periodically reviews such forecasts in comparison with actual results and expected trends 
in the event management determines that sufficient future taxable income  in light of tax planning strategies  may not be generated to fully realize net deferred tax assets  the corporation will increase valuation allowances by a charge to income tax expense in the period of such determination 
environmental costs environmental expenditures that relate to current operations are expensed or capitalized  as appropriate 
remediation costs that relate to an existing condition caused by past operations are accrued when it is probable that those costs will be incurred and can be reasonably estimated based on evaluations of current available facts related to each site
