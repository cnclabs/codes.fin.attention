item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview background 
the following discussion presents information about the consolidated results of operations  financial condition  liquidity and capital resources of the company and should be read in conjunction with the company s audited consolidated financial statements included in item of this report 
substantially all of the company s operations are conducted by the bank and the bank accounts for substantially all of the company s revenues and operating costs 
the bank was incorporated in and began operations in the company was incorporated in january for the purpose to become a holding company for and acquiring all of the outstanding shares of the bank  which occurred in june prior to the acquisition of the bank  the company conducted no business operations and  as a result  for accounting purposes the company s inception and commencement of operations the inception of the bank in and the commencement of its operations in  respectively 
during each of the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively  we achieved substantial growth in total assets and in the volume of interest earning assets  in each case over the preceding fiscal year 
total assets grew by and in and  respectively 
contributing to that growth was the opening of our fifth full service banking office  in la jolla  california  and our first loan production office  in la habra  california  in and our third and fourth full service banking offices  in costa mesa and beverly hills  california  in this rapid growth limits somewhat the comparability of our operating results in and  as compared to each of the respective preceding years 
forward looking information 
this discussion also contains information regarding operating trends and our beliefs and expectations regarding our future financial performance and future financial condition which is referred to as forward looking information 
that information is subject to the uncertainties and risks described below in the section of this report entitled forward looking information and uncertainties regarding future financial performance and readers of this report are urged to read that section in its entirety 
critical accounting policies bancorp has established various accounting policies which govern the application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states in the preparation of our financial statements 
certain accounting policies involve significant judgments and assumptions by management which have a material impact on the carrying value of certain assets and liabilities 
management considers such accounting policies to be critical accounting polices 
management believes accounting for allowance for loan losses and hedging instruments to be critical accounting policies in the presentation of the financial condition and results of operations requiring management to make approximate measurements of the financial effects based on transactions and events that have already occurred 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is an estimate of the losses that may be sustained in our loan portfolio 
the risk that borrowers will fail or be unable to repay their loans is an inherent part of the banking business 
in order to recognize on a timely basis  to the extent practicable  losses that can result from such failures  banks establish an allowance for loan losses by means of periodic charges to income known as provisions for loan losses 
loans are charged against the allowance for loan losses when management believes that collection of the carrying amount of the loan  either in whole or in part  has become unlikely 
periodic additions are made to the allowance i to replenish and thereby maintain the adequacy of the allowance following the occurrence of loan losses  and ii to increase the allowance in response to increases in the volume of outstanding loans and deterioration in economic conditions or in the financial condition of borrowers 
the bank evaluates the adequacy of and makes provisions to the allowance in order to maintain or increase the allowance for loan losses on a quarterly basis 
as a result  provisions for loan losses will normally represent a recurring expense 
please refer to footnote allowance for loan losses and footnote loans and allowance for loan losses for additional information 

table of contents derivative financial instruments the bank adopted the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted as of january  the bank uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates in accordance with its risk management policy 
generally speaking  if interest rates increase  the value of the bank s loan commitments to borrowers and mortgage loans held for sale are adversely impacted 
the bank attempts to economically hedge of the risk of the overall change in the fair value of loan commitments to borrowers and mortgage loans held for sale by entering into rate lock commitments with investors in mortgage loans at the date of loan commitments to the individual borrowers 
these rate lock commitments are entered into at the same terms extended to borrowers to be delivered to the investors at a future date 
please refer to footnote hedged items and footnote hedged instruments for additional information 
loan commitments to borrowers and rate lock commitments with investors in mortgage loans are non designated derivative instruments and are included in mortgage loans held for sale on the accompanying consolidated statements of financial condition 
gains and losses resulting from these derivative instruments are included in gains on sales of loans in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
overview of operating results in fiscal net interest income 
net interest income  which is a principal determinant of a banking organization s operating results  is the amount by which interest earned on loans  securities and other interest earning assets exceeds the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits 
in net interest income increased by nearly million  or approximately  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal as discussed more fully below  that improvement was primarily attributable to a increase in the average volume of our outstanding loans to million in fiscal from million in fiscal noninterest income and expense 
non interest income  which consists primarily of loan origination and processing fees and yield spread premium generated on mortgage loans originated or purchased by our mortgage banking division  grew by million  or  to million in fiscal from approximately million in fiscal due largely to residential mortgage refinancing activity that continued to be strong in as a result of declining mortgage interest rates 
our non interest expense grew by million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal most of the increase was attributable to the growth of the bank s operations  including the opening of a new la jollas banking office and a loan production office lpo and the first full year of operations of the two new banking offices that we opened  and the relocation and expansion of our headquarters offices that took place in net income

table of contents results of operations net interest income net interest income  the major source of our operating income  represents the difference between interest earned on interest earning assets  principally loans and investment securities  and the interest paid on interest bearing liabilities  principally deposits

table of contents the increase in interest expense in fiscal as compared to fiscal was primarily attributable to an increase of million in our average interest bearing deposits  which was partially offset by declining rates of interest that we paid on those deposits and other interest bearing liabilities from in to in the increase in interest expense in as compared to was primarily attributable to increase of a million increase in our average interest bearing deposits 
primarily as a result of the impact on interest rates of the federal reserve board s monetary policy and the slowness in the economy  which adversely affected loan demand and therefore  the mix between higher yielding loans and lower yielding investments  our net interest margin decreased in fiscal to from for and from for provision for loan losses 
the risk that borrowers will fail or be unable to repay their loans is an inherent part of the banking business 
as a result  like all other banks organizations  we follow the practice of maintaining a reserve or allowance the allowance for possible losses on loans that occur from time to time as an incidental part of the our business 
when it is determined that the payment in full of a loan has become unlikely  the carrying value of the loan is reduced to its realizable value 
this reduction  which is referred to as a loan charge off is charged against the allowance 
the amount of the allowance is increased periodically to replenish the allowance after it has been reduced due to loan charge offs and to reflect changes in i the volume of outstanding loans  and ii the risk of potential losses due to a deteriorations in the condition of borrowers or adverse changes in economic conditions  which can affect the ability of borrowers to meet their loan payment obligations and declines in the value of property securing non performing loans  which often becomes the primary source of payment when borrowers default in their loan payments 
see financial condition allowance for loan losses below in this section of this report 
increases in the allowance are made through a charge against income referred to as the provision for loan losses 
recoveries of loans previously charged off also are added back to and  therefore  also have the effect of increasing  the allowance 
during the year ended december   we made provisions for loan losses of  as compared to  for and  in  as a direct response to the growth in the volume of our outstanding loans 
loan charge offs for year ended december  totaled only  there were no loan charge offs in and loan charge offs totaled  in fiscal at december   the allowance represented of our gross loans 
see financial condition allowance for loan losses below 
although we employ economic models that are based on bank regulatory guidelines and industry standards to evaluate and determine the sufficiency of the allowance and  thereby  also the amount of the provisions required to be made for potential loan losses  those determinations involve judgments or forecasts about future economic conditions and other events that are subject to a number of uncertainties  some of which are outside of our ability to control 
see the discussion below under the caption forward looking information and uncertainties regarding future performance 
in the event circumstances were to change significantly from those expected at the time we make our estimates  it could become necessary in the future to incur additional charges in order to increase the allowance  which would have the effect of reducing our income or might even cause us to incur losses 
in addition  the federal reserve board and the dfi  as an integral part of their examination processes  periodically review the bank s allowance for loan losses 
these agencies may require the bank to make additional provisions  over and above those made by management  based on their judgments and formulated on the basis of information obtained during their periodic examinations of the bank 
noninterest income noninterest income consist primarily of mortgage banking income which includes loan origination and processing fees and yield spread premiums and net gains on sales of loans held for sale  which are generated by our mortgage loan division 
that division  which we established during fiscal  originates conforming and non conforming  agency quality  residential first and home equity mortgage loans 
as indicated in the table below  noninterest income increased by million  or  in fiscal and by million  or  in fiscal  in each case as compared to the prior fiscal year 
those increases were primarily attributable to increases in the volume of mortgage loan originations  in each fiscal and the mortgage banking industry is subject to significant increases and decreases in loan volume as interest rates change 
therefore  changes in interest rates can impact our loan origination and processing fees and yield spread premiums 
for example  the decline in mortgage rates which has occurred over the past two years has resulted in increased demand for 
table of contents mortgage loan refinancings 
conversely  a constant or increasing interest rate environment would generally cause a decline in loan refinancings and  therefore  volume of mortgage loans that we would be able to originate and  correspondingly  in income that the mortgage banking division would be able to generate 
we seek to manage the impact of changes in interest rates by maintaining a portion of our loan volume in mortgages for new home purchases retail mortgage loans which are not as interest rate sensitive as mortgage loan refinances 
for the year ended december   approximately of our mortgage loan fundings were for retail mortgage loans 
year ended december  dollars in thousands mortgage banking  including net gains on sales of loans held for sale referral fee  loans service charges and fees net gains on sales of securities available for sale merchant income ach fee income other total noninterest income noninterest expense 
noninterest expense in fiscal was million as compared to million for fiscal and million for fiscal salaries and employee benefits generally are the largest components of noninterest expense 
substantially all of the increase in noninterest expense in fiscal was attributable to a million increase  in our staffing  occupancy  depreciation and equipment cost that is attributable to i the opening by the bank of a new financial center in la jolla  california and a new loan production office in la habra  california and  to a much lesser extent  the commencement of operations of a new securities brokerage subsidiary by the company and ii a full year of operations of two new financial centers in costa mesa and beverly hills  california and the establishment of the company headquarters offices in costa mesa  which took place in the second and third quarters of also contributing to the increase in noninterest expense in were professional fees and related expenses incurred in connection with credit card refund claims in the bank s merchant processing department 

table of contents the following table sets forth the principal components of noninterest expense and the amounts thereof  incurred in year end december    and year ended december  dollars in thousands salaries and employee benefits occupancy depreciation equipment data processing professional fees other loan related stationery and supplies courier customer fees paid telephone organizational costs pmb securities  corporation mileage and parking insurance professional dues and memberships advertising  promotion  and development correspondent bank service charges operating losses other operating expense total noninterest income other operating expense primarily consists of donations  postage  loss in cash surrender value of life insurance  deposit insurance premiums  and travel expense 
included in noninterest expenses in fiscal were charges of  that were attributable to provisions made in the fourth quarter of to establish a reserve for refund claims relating to credit card transactions processed by the bank for a former merchant customer that has encountered financial difficulties and filed for bankruptcy and  as a result has been unable to perform service obligations owed to its customers 
because the bank collected a substantial number of credit card transactions for the merchant  it has had to pay some of the refund claims  and it may be required to pay additional refund claims in the future 
the provision taken in the fourth quarter of for such claims represented the bank s estimate of liability exposure for such refunds and the bank continues to believe  based on current information  that the provisions are adequate to cover the bank s potential liability for credit card refund charges 
however  it is possible that additional refund claims may be asserted against the bank and additional provisions may have to be made for such refund claims  in the future  the amounts of which cannot presently be predicted 
management s ability to control noninterest expense in relation to the level of net revenue net interest income plus noninterest income can be measured in terms of noninterest expenses as a percentage of net revenue 
this is known as the efficiency ratio and indicates the percentage of revenue that is used to cover expenses 
in  noninterest expense as a percentage of net revenue was  as compared to for and for these decreases indicated that a proportionately smaller amount of net revenue was needed to cover noninterest expenses arising from our day to day operations 
financial condition assets 
assets totaled million at december  as compared to million at december  the increase in total assets was largely attributable to increases in the volume of loans and investment securities that we were able to fund as a result of increases in deposits and borrowings from the federal home loan bank during securities available for sale 
the bank s investment policy  as established by the board of directors  is to provide for the liquidity needs of the bank and to generate a favorable return on investments without undue interest rate risk  credit risk or asset concentrations 

table of contents the bank is authorized to invest in obligations issued or fully guaranteed by the united states government  certain federal agency obligations  certain time deposits  certain municipal securities and federal funds sold 
it is our policy not to engage in investment securities trading activities 
the weighted average maturity of us government obligations  federal agency securities cannot exceed years and municipal obligations cannot exceed years 
time deposits must be placed with federally insured financial institutions  cannot exceed  in any one institution and may not have a maturity exceeding months 
securities available for sale are those that management intends to hold for periods of time that may vary depending on  and which may be sold in response to  changes in the bank s liquidity needs  changes in interest rates  changes in prepayment risks and other similar factors 
securities available for sale are reported at current market value for financial reporting purposes 
the market value  less the amortized cost of investment securities  net of income taxes  is adjusted directly to shareholders equity  rather than being reflected in operating results 
at december   securities available for sale had a fair market value of million with an amortized cost of million 
this represents an increase of million over total investment securities of million at december  see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements  included as item of this report  for information concerning the composition and the maturity distribution of the investment securities portfolio at december  and the decision to increase the volume of securities available for sale  which offered higher yields that other investment alternatives that were available to the bank during fiscal  was prompted by a combination of factors that were reducing our net interest margin and  hence  our net interest income in the first half of the year  including declining market rates of interest  increases in the volume of our deposits and a slowing in loan demand 
the purchases were funded primarily with lower cost deposits and borrowings that were available to us from the federal home loan bank and by liquidating lower yielding federal funds sold 
in january  we sold approximately million of such securities to reposition the portfolio from fixed rate to adjustable rate mortgage securities 
the proceeds from that sale were used to purchase federal funds 
as a result  at february   securities available for sale totaled million 
as a general rule  dependent upon liquidity requirements and absent unusual market conditions  it will be our practice in the future to limit the volume of securities held for sale  excluding federal home loan bank  federal reserve and fannie mae stock  to approximately of our total assets 
loans held for sale 
loans intended for sale in the secondary market  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  totaled million at december  and million at december  these loans are carried at the lower of cost or estimated fair value in the aggregate 
net unrealized losses  if any  are recognized through a valuation allowance by charges to income 
loans 
loans outstanding at december  and were made to customers in southern california  primarily in orange and los angeles counties 
the greatest concentration was in real estate loans and commercial loans  which represent and respectively  of the loan portfolio at december   as compared to and  respectively  at december  the increase in commercial loans is the result of programs that we initiated to attract business customers and it is our objective to increase the proportion of commercial loans in the future 
the following table sets forth the composition  by loan category  of the loan portfolio at december  and dollars in thousands december  percent december percent real estate loans commercial loans construction loans consumer loans gross loans deferred fee income allowance for loan losses loans  net commercial loans are loans to businesses to finance capital purchases or improvements  or to provide cash flow for operations 
real estate loans are loans secured by trust deeds on real property  including commercial property and single family and multifamily residences 
construction loans are interim loans to finance specific construction projects 
consumer loans include installment loans to consumers 

table of contents the following table sets forth the maturity distribution of the company s loan portfolio excluding consumer loans and mortgage available for sale at december  dollars in thousands one year or less over one year through five years over five years total real estate and construction loans floating rate fixed rate commercial loans floating rate fixed rate total allowance for loan losses 
the allowance for loan losses at december  was  which represented of outstanding loans as of that date 
by comparison  at december  the allowance was  which represented of outstanding loans at that date 
the bank carefully monitors changing economic conditions  the loan portfolio by category  borrowers financial condition and the history of the portfolio in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
we are not currently aware of any information indicating that there will be material deterioration in our loan portfolio and we believe that the allowance for loan losses at december  is adequate to provide for losses inherent in the portfolio 
however  the allowance was established on the basis of estimates developed primarily from historical industry loan loss data because the bank commenced operations in march and lacks historical data relating to the performance of loans in its loan portfolio 
as a result  ultimate losses may vary from the estimates used to establish the allowance 
additionally  as the volume of loans increases  additional provisions for loan losses will be required to maintain the allowance at levels deemed adequate 
moreover  if economic conditions were to deteriorate  it would become necessary to increase the provision to an even greater extent 
the following table provides the changes in the allowance for loan losses for the year ended december  and dollars in thousands total gross loans outstanding at end of year average total loans outstanding for the period allowance for loan losses at beginning of year loans charged off installment loan recoveries provision for loan losses charges to operating expense allowance for loan losses at end of year net charge offs as a percentage of average total loans net charge offs as a percentage of total loans outstanding at end of year allowance for loan losses as a percentage of average total loans allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total outstanding loans at end of year net charge offs as a percentage of average total loans net charge offs as a percentage of total loans outstanding at end year net loans charged off to allowance for loan losses net loans charged off to provision for loan losses includes net deferred loan costs and excludes loans held for sale 
we also evaluate loans for impairment  which occurs when the principal of and interest on a loan is not expected to be collected in accordance with the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
we measure and reserve for impairment on a loan by loan basis using either the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s effective interest rate  or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
as of december   we had no loans classified as impaired 
we exclude from our impairment calculations smaller  homogeneous loans such as 
table of contents consumer installment loans and lines of credit 
also  loans that experience insignificant payment delays or payment shortfalls are generally not considered impaired 
as of december   the bank had only  which was a consumer loan  in nonaccrual and impaired assets and no loans delinquent days or more as to principal 
the following table provides a summary of the allocation of the allowance for loan losses for specific loan categories at the dates indicated 
the allocations presented should not be interpreted as an indication that loans charged to the allowance for loan losses will occur in these amounts or proportions  or that the portion of the allowance allocated to each loan category represents the total amount available for future losses that may occur within these categories 
the total allowance is applicable to the entire loan portfolio 
december  dollars in thousands allowance for loan losses of allowance to category of loans allowance for loan losses of allowance to category of loans real estate loans commercial loans construction loans consumer loans unallocated n a n a n a total specific allocations are identified by loan category and allocated according to charge off data pertaining to the banking industry 
substantially all of the loans in the loan portfolio are graded and incorporated in the process of assessing the adequacy of the allowance 
the allowance is maintained at a level considered sufficient to absorb estimated losses in the loan portfolio  and the allowance not allocated to specific loan categories is considered unallocated and evaluated based on management s assessment of the portfolio s overall risk profile 
deposits 
at december  deposits totaled million  which included million of certificates of deposits of  or more 
by comparison  deposits at december  totaled million  which included million of certificates of deposit of  or more 
noninterest bearing demand deposits totaled million at december  this represented an increase of million over total noninterest bearing demand deposits of million at december  noninterest bearing deposits represented of total deposits as of december  and of total deposits as of december  the change in the mix of noninterest bearing demand deposits to total deposits from december  to december  was driven largely by the increase in certificates of deposit generated primarily through the internet bank 
set forth below is a maturity schedule of domestic time certificates of deposit outstanding at december  dollars in thousands maturities certificates of deposit under  certificates of deposit  or more three months or less over three and through twelve months over twelve months liquidity the company s liquidity needs are actively managed to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet the ongoing needs of the company s customers 
the company projects the future sources and uses of funds and maintains sufficient liquid funds for unanticipated events 
the primary sources of funds include growth in deposits  payments on loans  the sale or maturity of 
table of contents investments  and increases in borrowings 
the primary uses of funds includes funding new loans  making advances on existing lines of credit  purchasing investments  funding deposit withdrawals and paying operating expenses 
the company maintains funds in overnight federal funds and other short term investments to provide for short term liquidity needs 
cash flow from financing activities  primarily representing increases in deposits and other borrowings  totaled million for the year ended december  net cash provided in operating activities  primarily representing the net decrease in loans held for sale and the net change in other assets  totaled million 
net cash used in investing activities  primarily representing increases in securities available for sale and loans  totaled million for the year ended december  at december   liquid assets  which included cash and due from banks  federal funds sold  interest earning deposits at other financial institutions and unpledged securities available for sale excluding federal reserve bank stock and federal home loan bank stock totaled million or of total assets 
since the bank s primary uses of funds are loans and the primary sources of the funds used to make loans are deposits  the relationship between gross loans and total deposits provides a useful measure of the bank s liquidity 
typically  the closer the ratio of loans to deposits is to  the more reliant the bank is on its loan portfolio to provide for short term liquidity needs 
since repayment of loans tends to be less predictable than the maturity of investments and other liquid resources  the higher the loan to deposit ratio the less liquid are the bank s assets 
on the other hand  since the bank realizes greater yields and higher interest income on loans than it does on investments  a lower loan to deposit ratio can adversely affect interest income and the earnings of the bank 
as a result  management s goal is to achieve a loan to deposit ratio that appropriately balances the requirements of liquidity and the need to generate a fair return on assets 
at december   the ratio of loans excluding loans held for sale to deposits was  compared to at december  the company  as parent corporation of the bank  is a company separate and apart from the bank that must provide for its own liquidity 
substantially all of bancorp s revenues are obtained from interest income on investments  because there are statutory and regulatory provisions that limit the ability of the bank to pay dividends and to make loans to the company see note to consolidated financial statements 
at december   the company had million of short term investments and million of trust preferred stock see notes and to the company s consolidated financial statements 
those investments were funded by a portion of the proceeds of our public offering in june and the proceeds from private placements of trust preferred securities sold during the remaining net proceeds of that offering and trust preferred securities were contributed to the bank to increase its capital and  thereby  support its growth 
as of december   we did not have any material commitments for capital expenditures 
capital resources the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on a stand alone basis are subject to various regulatory capital requirements administered by federal and state banking agencies 
see business supervision and regulation 
failure to meet minimum capital requirements can lead to the imposition of certain mandatory and possible additional discretionary restrictions on the operations of the company and the bank by their respective bank regulatory agencies  that  if imposed  could have a direct material adverse impact on the company s operating results and financial condition 
see business supervision and regulation capital standards and prompt corrective action in part i of this report 
under capital adequacy guidelines and the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action that apply to all bank holding companies and fdic insured banks in the united states  the company on a consolidated basis and the bank must meet specific capital guidelines that involve quantitative measures of assets  liabilities  and certain off balance sheet items as calculated under regulatory accounting practices 
the company s capital and classifications also are subject to qualitative judgments by the bank regulators as to components  risk weightings  and other factors 
quantitative measures established by regulation to ensure capital adequacy require the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on an individual basis to maintain minimum amounts and ratios of total and tier i capital generally  common stock  non redeemable preferred stock and retained earnings to risk weighted assets as defined  and of tier i capital to average total assets 
trust preferred securities 
during  the company augmented its capital resources through the following sales of trust preferred securities 
table of contents in june  the company established a wholly owned subsidiary  pacific mercantile capital trust i  a delaware trust  which sold  of trust preferred securities to an institutional investor in a private placement 
these securities mature in years  are redeemable at the company s option beginning after years  and require quarterly distributions  initially at a rate of  which will reset quarterly at the three month libor rate plus 
in august  the company formed a second wholly owned subsidiary  pmb capital trust i  also a delaware trust  which sold  of trust preferred securities to an institutional investor in a private placement 
these securities mature in years  are redeemable at the company s option beginning after years  and require semi annual distributions  initially at a rate of  which will reset semi annual at the six month libor rate plus 
finally in september  the company formed a third wholly owned subsidiary  pmb statutory trust iii  a connecticut trust  which sold  of trust preferred securities to an institutional investor in a private placement 
these securities mature in years  are redeemable at the company s option beginning after years  and require quarterly distributions  initially at a rate of  which will reset quarterly at the three month libor rate plus 
the trust preferred securities are senior in priority to the company s common stock  but subordinated to borrowings that may be obtained by the company 
of the  of those trust preferred securities  qualify as tier i capital  with the remaining trust preferred securities qualifying as tier ii capital  for regulatory purposes 
of the proceeds from these sales of the trust preferred securities   was contributed to the bank to increase its capital and the remaining proceeds have been invested by the company in a mortgage back security pending further use of those funds  which may include additional contributions to the bank s capital to the extent necessary to support its growth and to fund the growth of the company 
as indicated below  at december   the company on a consolidated basis and the bank on an individual basis exceeded all capital adequacy requirement to which they are subject and  based on applicable capital regulations  as of december  were categorized as well capitalized under the regulatory framework for prompt corrective action

forward looking information and uncertainties regarding future financial performance this report  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  contains certain forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are estimates of  or expectations or beliefs regarding our future financial performance that are based on current information and that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause our actual operating results and financial performance in the future to differ significantly from those expected at the current time 
those risks and uncertainties include  although they are not limited to  the following increased competition 
increased competition from other banks and from other financial service businesses  mutual funds and securities brokerage and investment banking firms that offer competitive loan and investment products could 
table of contents require us to reduce interest rates and loan fees to attract new loans or to increase interest rates that we offer on time deposits to attract deposits  either or both of which could  in turn  reduce our net interest margins and  therefore  also our net interest income 
possible adverse changes in local economic conditions 
adverse changes in local economic conditions could i reduce loan demand resulting in reduced net interest margins and net interest income  ii affect the financial capability of borrowers in a manner that would make it more difficult for them to meet their loan obligations which could  therefore  result in increases in loan losses and require increases in provisions made for possible loan losses  thereby reducing our earnings  and iii lead to reductions in real property values that  due to our reliance on real property to secure many of our loans  could make it more difficult for us to prevent losses from being incurred on non performing loans through the sale of such real properties 
possible adverse changes in national economic conditions and federal reserve board monetary policies 
changes in national economic conditions  such as declines in economic output or increases in inflation usually prompt changes in federal reserve board monetary policies that could reduce net interest margins or increase the cost of funds to us  particularly if we are unable  due to competitive pressures or the rate insensitivity of earning assets  to effectuate commensurate increases in the rates we are able to charge on existing or new loans 
increase in interest rates also could lead to a decline in the volume of mortgage loan refinancings that would reduce the income generated by our mortgage banking division 
additionally  in the past few months there has been a slowing in economic growth nationally  and uncertainties about the direction of the economy  the duration and severity of which are difficult to predict at this time 
among other things  these conditions could lead to reductions in loan demand  thereby reducing our net interest margins and net interest income and could adversely affect the financial capability of borrowers to meet their loan obligations which could result in loan losses and require increases in provisions made for possible loan losses  either or both of which could reduce our income 
effects of regulatory policies on operations and operating results 
if our financial performance or financial condition were to deteriorate  federal and state bank regulatory policies could impose restrictions on our operations that could increase the cost of our operations and make it more difficult to achieve further growth 
additionally  changes in federal  such as increases in capital requirements or in loan loss reserve or asset liability ratio requirements  could adversely affect earnings by reducing yields on earning assets or increasing operating costs 
effects of growth 
it is our intention to take advantage of opportunities to increase our business  either through acquisitions of other banks or the establishment of new banking offices 
if we acquire any other banks or open any additional new offices  we are likely to incur additional operating costs that could cause our operating results to decline at least until such time as the acquired banks are integrated into our operations and those new offices achieve profitability 
potential additional credit card refund claims 
as is described more fully above under the caption  operating results noninterest expense  the bank has sustained and it may incur additional credit card refund charges arising out of the bankruptcy of a former merchant customer 
in the fourth quarter of the bank established a reserve of  for such charges 
we currently believe that the reserve  which was created by charges to income recorded in the fourth quarter of  will be adequate to cover possible future credit card refund charges 
however  if refund claims that arise in the future that exceed our estimates  we may be required to increase the reserves for such charges which would have the effect of reducing our earnings in the future 
other risks 
other risks that could affect our future financial performance are described in the section entitled risk factors in the prospectus dated june   included in our s registration statement filed with the securities and exchange commission under the securities act of  as amended  and readers are urged to review those risks as well 
due to these and other possible uncertainties and risks  readers are cautioned not to place undue reliance on the forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date of this report 
we also disclaim any obligation to update forward looking statements contained in this report or in the above reference s registration statement 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company is exposed to market risk as a consequence of the normal course of conducting its business activities 
the primary market risk to which the company is exposed is interest rate risk 
the company s interest rate risk arises from the instruments  positions and transactions entered into for purposes other than trading 
they include loans  securities  deposit liabilities  and short term borrowings 
interest rate risk occurs when assets and liabilities reprice at different times as market interest rates change 
interest rate risk is managed within an overall asset liability framework for the company 
asset liability management the objective of asset liability management is to reduce our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
we seek to achieve this objective by matching interest rate sensitive assets and liabilities  and maintaining the maturity and repricing of these assets and liabilities at appropriate levels given the interest rate environment 
generally  if rate sensitive assets exceed rate sensitive liabilities  the net interest income will be positively impacted during a rising rate environment and negatively impacted during a declining rate environment 
when rate sensitive liabilities exceed rate sensitive assets  the net interest income will generally be positively impacted during a declining rate environment and negatively impacted during a rising rate environment 
however  because interest rates for different asset and liability products offered by depository institutions respond differently to changes in the interest rate environment  the gap is only a general indicator of interest rate sensitivity 
the following table sets forth information concerning our rate sensitive assets and rate sensitive liabilities as of december  the assets and liabilities are classified by the earlier of maturity or repricing date in accordance with their contractual terms 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the following table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods of repricing  they may react in different degrees and at different times to changes in market interest rates 

table of contents rates on some assets and liabilities change in advance of changes in market rates of interest  while rates on other assets or liabilities may lag behind changes in market rates of interest 
also  loan prepayments and early withdrawals of certificates of deposit could cause the interest sensitivities to vary from those that appear in the table 
dollars in thousands three month or less over three through twelve months over one year through five years over five years non interest bearing total assets interest bearing deposits in other financial institutions securities available for sale federal funds sold federal reserve bank  fannie mae preferred  and federal home loan bank stock loans  gross non interest earning assets total assets liabilities and shareholders equity noninterest bearing deposits interest bearing deposits borrowings other liabilities trust preferred stock shareholders equity total liabilities and shareholders equity interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap cumulative of rate sensitive assets in maturity period rate sensitive assets to rate sensitive liabilities n a n a cumulative ratio at december   our rate sensitive balance sheet was shown to be in a negative year gap position 
this implies that our earnings would decrease in the short term if interest rates were to rise and would increase in the short term if interest rates were to fall 
however  as noted above  this may not necessarily be the case depending on how quickly rate sensitive assets and liabilities react to interest rate changes 

table of contents derivative financial instruments the bank uses derivative instruments to reduce its exposure to adverse fluctuations in interest rates in accordance with its risk management policy 
generally  if interest rates increase  the value of the bank s loan commitments to borrowers and mortgage loans held for sale are adversely impacted 
the bank attempts to economically hedge of the risk of the overall change in the fair value of loan commitments to borrowers and mortgage loans held for sale by entering into rate lock commitments with investors in mortgage loans at the date of loan commitments are made to the individual borrowers 
these rate lock commitments are entered into at the same terms as those extended to borrowers to be delivered to the investors at a future date 
loan commitments to borrowers and rate lock commitments with investors in mortgage loans are non designated derivative instruments and are included in mortgage loans held for sale  gains and losses resulting from these derivative instruments are included in gains on sales of loans  in the accompanying company s consolidated statements of income contained in item of this report
