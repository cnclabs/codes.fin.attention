all references to notes are to notes to the consolidated financial statements 
prior share amounts and earnings per share have been restated to give retroactive effect to the company s stock dividend  which was effective in april company profile overview jefferson pilot corporation is a financial services and broadcasting company providing products and services in four major businesses life insurance  annuities and investment products  group life  disability and dental insurance  and broadcasting and sports programming production 
our individual products segment offers a wide array of both fixed and variable life insurance products 
our annuity and investment product aip segment offers fixed and variable annuity products as well as other investment products marketed through our broker dealer 
our benefit partners segment offers group non medical products such as term life  disability and dental insurance to the employer marketplace 
the communications segment consists of radio and television broadcasting operations located in selected markets in the southeastern and western united states  and sports program production 
our other segment  corporate and other  contains the activities of the parent company and passive investment affiliates  surplus of the life insurance subsidiaries not allocated to other reportable segments  financing expenses on corporate debt  strategic initiatives intended to benefit the entire company  and federal and state income taxes not otherwise allocated to business segments 
we include all realized gains and losses on investments in the corporate and other segment  and hold all impaired securities in this segment 
realized investment gains are gains and losses on sales and write downs of investments  and although these are included in revenues  we exclude them in assessing the performance of our business segments 
we may realize investment gains in our sole discretion from our available for sale equity and bond portfolios

jefferson pilot securities corporation with related entities  jpsc is a registered non clearing broker dealer that sells affiliated and non affiliated variable life and annuity products and other investment products 
segment revenues the revenues for our reportable segments  excluding realized gains and losses  were as follows year ended individual products aip benefit partners communications corporate and other critical accounting policies general we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to the understanding of our results of operations and our financial position 
the application of these critical accounting policies in preparing our financial statements requires management to use significant judgments and estimates concerning future results or other developments including the likelihood  timing or amount of one or more future transactions or amounts 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  assumptions and judgments based upon historical experience and various other information that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
for a detailed discussion of other significant accounting policies  see note dac and voba deferred acquisition costs dac and value of business acquired voba reflect our expectations about the future experience of the existing business in force 
the primary assumptions regarding future experience that can affect the carrying value of dac and voba balances include mortality  interest spreads and policy lapse rates 
significant changes in these assumptions can impact the amortization of dac and voba in both the current and future periods  which is reflected in earnings 
see the financial position section for further discussion of these items including a sensitivity analysis regarding the impact of changes in critical assumptions or expectations 
investments we regularly monitor our investment portfolio to ensure that investments that may be other than temporarily impaired are identified in a timely fashion and properly valued  and that any impairments are charged against earnings in the proper period 
our methodology to identify potential impairments requires professional judgment and is further described in the investments section 
valuing our investment portfolio involves a variety of assumptions and estimates  particularly for investments that are not actively traded 
we rely on external pricing sources for highly liquid publicly traded securities and use an internal pricing matrix for privately placed securities 
this matrix relies on our judgment concerning the discount rate we use in calculating expected future cash flows  credit quality  industry sector performance  and expected maturity 
under certain circumstances  we make adjustments as we apply professional judgment based upon specific detailed information concerning the issuer 
as the discussion above indicates  many judgments are involved in timely identifying and valuing securities  including potentially impaired securities 
inherently  there are risks and uncertainties involved in making these judgments 
changes in circumstances and critical assumptions such as a continued weak economy  a more pronounced economic downturn or unforeseen events which affect one or more companies  industry sectors or countries could result in additional write downs in future periods for impairments that are deemed to be other than temporary 
litigation in recent years  the life insurance industry has experienced increased litigation in which large jury awards including punitive damages or settlements in lieu of litigation have occurred 
establishing accruals for specific litigation inherently involves a variety of estimates of future potential outcomes 
accordingly  management  based on the advice of internal and external counsel  reviews each specific litigation matter and makes a judgment whether it is probable we have incurred a loss 
once it is determined that a loss is probable  we use professional judgment in determining whether we can reasonably estimate the loss 
in general  we accrue the costs of defense until we can reasonably estimate the loss or any potential range of possible loss 
at that time  these additional costs are accrued 
based on consultation with our legal advisors  we believe that resolution of pending legal proceedings will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or liquidity but could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations for a specific period 
results of operations in the following discussion  reportable segment results and total reportable segment results include all elements of net income available to common stockholders except realized investment gains and losses 
we use reportable segment results in assessing the performance of our business segments internally and believe it to be relevant and useful information 
reportable segment results as described above may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
the following tables illustrate our results before and after including realized investment gains and losses and reconcile reportable segment results to net income available to common stockholders  the most directly comparable gaap financial measure consolidated summary of income total reportable segment results a realized investment losses gains net of applicable income taxes net income available to common stockholders consolidated earnings per share basic total reportable segment results b realized investment losses gains net of applicable income taxes net income available to common stockholders fully diluted total reportable segment results realized investment losses gains net of applicable income taxes net income available to common stockholders a includes relating to the cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivatives 
b includes per share of income relating to cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivatives 
average number of shares outstanding    average number of shares outstanding assuming dilution    net income available to common stockholders decreased in and increased in in  we experienced net investment losses due primarily to other than temporary bond impairments in excess of gains from sales of equity securities  which are discussed in more detail in the corporate and other and in the investments sections 
total reportable segment results decreased in and increased in the primary factors contributing to the decline in earnings were an increase in the accrual for pending litigation in our corporate segment  increased mortality in our individual life lines  weak equity markets that affected our variable universal life vul and variable annuity va products  lower spreads on our universal life ul and fixed annuity products  lost income on defaulted securities  and funds used for stock repurchases which reduced investment income 
these unfavorable influences were mitigated in by lower financing costs  the elimination of amortization of certain intangible assets under sfas  growth in our communications and our benefit partners segments  and accelerated accrual of discount on our mortgage backed securities portfolios 
earnings per share amounts for the reportable segments were more favorable than the absolute earnings amounts due to repurchases of  shares in and  shares in the average number of diluted shares outstanding declined in and in results by business segment we assess profitability by business segment and measure other operating statistics as detailed in the separate segment discussions that follow 
we determine reportable segments in a manner consistent with the way we organize for purposes of making operating decisions and assessing performance 
sales are one of the statistics we use to track performance 
our sales  which are primarily of long duration contracts in the individual products and aip segments  have little immediate impact on revenues for these two segments as described in the segment discussions below 
results by reportable segment individual products aip a benefit partners communications corporate and other total reportable segment results net realized investment losses gains net income available to common stockholders a includes relating to the cumulative effect of change in accounting for derivatives 
segment assets we assign invested assets backing insurance liabilities to our segments in relation to policyholder funds and reserves 
we assign net dac and voba  reinsurance receivables and communications assets to the respective segments where those assets originate 
we also assign invested assets to back capital allocated to each segment in relation to our philosophy for managing business risks  reflecting appropriate conservatism 
we assign the remainder of invested and other assets  including all impaired securities  to the corporate and other segment 
individual products   aip   benefit partners communications corporate and other   total assets   individual products the individual products segment markets individual life insurance policies through independent general agents  independent national account marketing firms and agency building general agents  together referred to as our core agency channels 
we also sell products through home service agents  broker dealers  banks and other strategic alliances 
individual products include ul and vul  together referred to as ul type products  as well as traditional life products 
the operating cycle for life insurance products is long term in nature  therefore  actuarial assumptions and the judgments used in those assumptions are important to the financial reporting for these products 
traditional products require the policyholder to pay scheduled premiums over the life of the coverage 
we recognize traditional premium receipts as revenues  and profits are expected to emerge in relation thereto 
ul type product premiums may vary over the life of the policy at the discretion of the policyholder  so we do not recognize them as revenues when received  although ul type premiums do increase assets and liabilities 
we recognize revenues on these products from mortality  expense and surrender charges to policyholder fund balances policy charges 
additionally  we earn interest spreads on all ul type and traditional products 
policy benefits include interest credited to policyholder fund balances as well as claim related costs 
reportable segment results also include earnings on allocated capital for both traditional and ul type products 
segment results were traditional premiums and other considerations ul and investment product charges net investment income other income total revenues      policy benefits  expenses total benefits and expenses      reportable segment results before income taxes provision for income taxes reportable segment results individual products reportable segment results decreased in and increased in as further discussed below 
the following table summarizes key data for individual products that we believe are our important drivers and indicators of future profitability annualized life insurance premium sales sales excluding large case boli large case boli average ul policyholder fund balances    average vul separate account assets    average face amount of insurance in force total    ul type policies    average assets    core agency channel sales were  and for  and  which represented  and of annualized life insurance premium sales excluding large case bank owned life insurance boli for each of the three years presented 
this increase in sales is a result of our premier partnering strategic initiative and the introduction of several new ul products 
total sales excluding boli increased in and in single premium products targeted to smaller banks and sold through our target marketing channel provided of life sales in and in for large case boli  our business strategy is to respond to individual sales opportunities when the market accommodates our required returns 
thus  boli sales will vary widely between periods 
revenues include traditional insurance premiums and policy charges  net of reinsurance  and net investment income 
individual traditional premiums decreased in and in due to the decline in our traditional business in force as we are focusing our efforts towards ul type products and because we began reinsuring of our term life insurance product in ul and investment product charges increased in and in the ul product charges grew faster than the average ul policyholder fund balances since certain recent products are designed with larger up front expense charges 
the increase in up front product charges is offset by an increase in unearned revenue reserves accounted for as policy benefits  and these product charges are taken into income over time 
net investment income increased and in and  reflecting the growth in average policyholder funds partially offset by declines in investment yields 
the average investment spread on fixed ul products calculated as the difference between portfolio yields earned on invested assets less interest credited to policyholder funds  included in policy benefits decreased basis points to in and increased basis points to in interest spreads are affected by portfolio yields and our crediting rates  and also may vary over time due to our competitive strategies and changes in product design 
in response to a decline in portfolio yields  we reduced credited rates across the product line at various times in by basis points on average 
this includes a reduction of basis points later in the fourth quarter  the effects of which were only nominally realized in the current average crediting rate is  while the average minimum guarantee rate on this product line is 
during prepayments of mortgage backed securities significantly increased as a result of continued declines in long term mortgage rates 
our mortgage backed securities portfolio is primarily a discount portfolio  therefore  the effect of these prepayments was to accelerate the accretion of discount and increase the effective yields on our mortgage backed portfolio  which increased net investment income for the individual products segment by in and for these prepayments were not significant in we are investing the proceeds from these prepayments at current market yields which are lower than our portfolio yields 
total policy benefits increased and in and due primarily to increases in mortality  interest credited and deferred revenue 
policy benefits on traditional business include death benefits  dividends  surrenders and changes in reserves  with the most significant being death benefits 
total policy benefits on traditional contracts represented of premiums in compared to in and in  reflecting increased mortality in and policy benefits on ul type products include interest credited to policyholder accounts  death benefits in excess of fund balances and changes in unearned revenue reserves 
total policy benefits on ul type products increased to of average policyholder funds and separate accounts in versus in and in the increases in interest credited of and in and reflect growth in average ul fund balances of and in and partially offset by lower crediting rates 
increased sales of products with higher up front expense charges have increased deferred revenue  as discussed earlier 
net deferrals of revenue increased in and in death benefits constitute a significant portion of policy benefits 
our actual mortality experience for ul type products per thousand dollars of face amount of insurance in force was in  in and in increases in our retention limit from to in early caused our mortality cost per thousand dollars of face amount of insurance in force to increase by in and in while this change improved our overall operating results due to lower premiums paid to reinsurers that flow primarily through ul and investment product charges  it increases the volatility of our mortality costs in a given year 
to aid our analysis of actual mortality expense  we recently completed a multi year study that compared our actual mortality over the past four years to the standard actuarial table 
this study indicates that our mortality experience over the period of the study is within our expected range  although fluctuating from year to year 
total expenses including the net deferral and amortization of dac and voba increased in and decreased in the expense details are as follows commissions general and administrative acquisition related general and administrative maintenance related taxes  licenses and fees total commissions and expenses incurred less commissions and expenses capitalized amortization of dac and voba total expense the increase in expenses reflects higher amortization of dac and voba  partially offset by improved maintenance expenses 
recent years growth in the individual products segment is the primary contributor to this increase in amortization  although there were other items impacting amortization as well 
better persistency levels in acquired blocks of business caused us to lower amortization on our fixed ul products by in partially offsetting this is a increase in amortization on vul insurance products due to limitation of mean reversion techniques as a result of declining equity markets  as further discussed in the financial position section 
the expense amounts we capitalize as dac include first year commissions  as well as deferrable acquisition expenses 
we generally limit our capitalization of deferrable acquisition expenses to the lower of product specific pricing allowables or our actual deferrable acquisition costs 
as our sales have increased  pricing allowables have covered a greater amount of capitalizable acquisition expenses other than commissions 
increased sales resulted in higher capitalization of these expenses of in and in average individual products assets grew and in and  primarily due to sales of fixed ul products and growth in existing ul policyholder fund balances  partially offset by declines in the market values of separate account assets of variable products 
average vul separate account assets decreased and in and adjusting for the decrease in market value  net of dividends  year over year  separate account balances would have increased by approximately in and total fund balances would have grown by in our financial and operating risks for this segment include  among others  interest spread risks  mortality risks  changes in the underlying assumptions of dac and voba and the effects of unresolved litigation 
we discuss these risks in more detail in the financial position  capital resources and liquidity  and market risk exposures sections 
annuity and investment products annuity and investment products are marketed through most distribution channels discussed in the individual products segment as well as through financial institutions  investment professionals and annuity marketing organizations 
jpsc markets variable life insurance and variable annuities written by our insurance subsidiaries and other carriers  and also sells other securities and mutual funds 
reportable segment results were policy charges  premiums and other considerations net investment income concession and other income total revenues policy benefits expenses total benefits and expenses reportable segment results before income taxes provision for income taxes reportable segment results aip reportable segment results increased in and decreased in as further discussed below 
the following table summarizes key information for aip fixed annuity premium sales   variable annuity premium sales investment product sales    average policyholder fund balances    average separate account policyholder fund balances effective investment spreads for fixed annuities fixed annuity surrenders as a percentage of beginning fund balances average assets    we derive annuity revenues from investment income on segment assets  policy charges and concession income earned on investment product sales by jpsc 
aip revenues increased in and in  driven by growth in investment income  partially offset by lower policy charge income 
our policy charge income continues to decline as our product mix focuses more on products that derive most of their earnings from investment spreads rather than from policy charges and as a result of lower surrenders 
net investment income grew in and in  which was lower than the growth in average policyholder fund balances of in  primarily due to a decline in new investment yields 
the effect of the prepayments of mortgage backed securities mentioned earlier was to accelerate the accretion of discount on our mortgage backed portfolio  increasing net investment income in the aip segment by in and in investment income for included due to the cumulative effect of the change in accounting for derivatives 
fixed annuity premium sales decreased in and increased in annuity sales were the highest ever for the company in  and the decline reflects the current competitive fixed annuity market and our unwillingness to match our competitors crediting rates  especially in the bank channel 
despite a slight increase in investment product sales  jpsc s concession and other income decreased and in and  primarily because of sales of lower commission securities 
fixed annuity surrenders as a percentage of beginning fund balances declined to from in and in the lower lapse rates reflect the effects of increased surrender charge protection on our in force block of business  the lower interest rate environment and the increasing percentage of our annuity block with multi year crediting rate guarantees 
the surrender rate in the aip segment is influenced by many other factors such as the portion of the business that has low or no remaining surrender charges  competition from annuity products including those which pay up front interest rate bonuses or higher market rates  and rising interest rates that may make returns available on new annuities or investment products more attractive than our older annuities 
fixed annuity fund balances with or more surrender charges increased to at year end from at year end policy benefits  which are mainly comprised of interest credited to policyholder accounts  increased in and in  reflecting growth in average fund balances partially offset by lower crediting rates 
effective investment spreads on fixed annuities declined to in from  as yields earned on the investment portfolio dropped faster than we lowered our crediting rates and due to sales of products designed with lower spread requirements because of lower commissions 
in response to this decline in portfolio yields  we lowered crediting rates throughout the year  including a basis point reduction late in the fourth quarter of  the effects of which were only nominally realized in the current average crediting rate on the portfolio is  while the average minimum guarantee rate on this portfolio is for total aip expenses decreased and in and  due primarily to lower maintenance expenses along with lower commission expenses of jpsc 
the expense details are as follows commissions insurance companies commissions broker dealer general and administrative acquisition related general and administrative maintenance related taxes  licenses and fees total commissions and expenses incurred less commissions and expenses capitalized amortization of dac and voba total expense as a result of the declining equity markets in  we increased the amortization of dac on our variable annuity products by using the mean reversion techniques as further discussed in the financial position section 
however  due to lower lapse rates experienced on our fixed annuity products  we lowered dac amortization by the remaining increase in dac amortization was due to overall growth in the business 
jpsc earnings were  and for  and the increase was primarily due to lower general and administrative expenses  while the decline was directly related to lower equity and mutual fund purchase sale transactions 
return on average assets for aip was  and for   and a number of factors affected the decline in including decreased interest spreads that were partially offset by dac unlocking 
the drop in generally resulted from reduced jpsc earnings coupled with a decrease in interest spreads 
an inherent risk in the annuity business is that continued low or further declines in investment yields coupled with competition from competing products and minimum rate guarantees could further reduce our investment spread 
another risk associated with the annuity business is increased lapses when interest rates rise  particularly in the portion of business subject to low or no surrender charges 
we discuss these risks in more detail in the financial position  capital resources and liquidity  and market risk exposures sections 
benefit partners the benefit partners segment offers group non medical products such as term life  disability and dental insurance to the employer marketplace 
these products are marketed primarily through a national distribution system of regional group offices 
these offices develop business through employee benefit brokers  third party administrators and other employee benefit firms 
the benefit partners segment was created in january through the integration of our existing group life and disability operations into guarantee life insurance company s guarantee life  disability and dental operations acquired in december segment results before include only the group life and health products sold by jp life 
reportable segment results were premiums and other considerations investment income  net of expenses total revenues policy benefits expenses total benefits and expenses reportable segment results before income taxes provision for income taxes reportable segment results benefit partners reportable segment results increased in as further discussed below 
reportable segment results increased in  primarily due to growth in the business and the integration of guarantee 
the following table summarizes key information for benefit partners life  disability  and dental annualized sales loss ratio total expenses  of premium income average assets benefit partners revenues increased and in and and annualized new sales for the core life  disability and dental lines grew in and in the sales increases for and reflect the impacts of increases in the number of representatives of and coupled with the maturation of the sales force selling these products under the jefferson pilot name 
additional factors driving the increase in sales for these two years included our strong ratings  our technology driven customer service and a refocus by employers on their non medical benefit needs 
policy benefits increased and in and driven by growth in the business coupled with slightly adverse claims experience in in the disability line 
our life  disability and dental incurred loss ratio increased in to versus in and in  but was still within our expected range 
while we closely monitor the loss ratio  we feel our risk management procedures are sound and some fluctuations are inherent in this segment 
total expenses increased and in and  due to growth in the business 
as a percentage of premium income  total expenses were in versus in and in  reflecting disciplined expense management 
the expense details are as follows commissions general and administrative taxes  licenses and fees total commissions and expenses incurred less commissions and expenses capitalized amortization of dac total expense acquisition costs consisting of commissions and other expenses that are primarily related to contracts issued or renewed are capitalized and are charged to expense in proportion to the revenue recognized 
the amount of acquisition costs capitalized as well as the amount amortized grew in proportion with the increase in sales for  and risks beyond normal competition that may impact this segment include increased morbidity risk due to a weak economy that may increase disability claim costs  continued medical cost inflation that can put pressure on non medical benefit premium rates because employers may focus more on the employer s cost of non medical programs  and mortality risks including concentration risks from acts of terrorism not priced for or reinsured 
we are mitigating these risks by monitoring new and existing claims and industry health care trend reports which serve as indicators of increased employer medical costs  and through intensive review of our concentration risks 
our group life reinsurance agreement covering extraordinary life claims arising from catastrophic events expired in april we began relying primarily on case by case management to mitigate our concentration exposures over time 
we then supplemented this strategy with the purchase  effective september   of a new group life facultative reinsurance program which covers extraordinary life and accidental death or dismemberment claims arising from war or terrorism events excluding nuclear  chemical or biological events for covered groups at specific sites 
the coverage provides reimbursement in various layers for losses that exceed  up to a maximum reimbursement of we continue to monitor reinsurance market developments to stay abreast of options that could enhance our management of this risk 
one of our non core products  exec u care r  which provides an insured medical expense reimbursement vehicle to executives for non covered health plan costs  produced revenues for this segment of approximately and net income of approximately in a discontinuation of exec u care r  while not anticipated  would have a significant impact on segment revenues  but only a limited effect on net income 
communications jpcc operates radio and television broadcast properties and produces syndicated sports programming 
reportable segment results were communications revenues net operating costs and expenses broadcast cash flow depreciation and amortization corporate general and administrative expenses net interest expense operating revenue before income taxes provision for income taxes reportable segment results reportable segment results increased in and decreased in the increase was primarily due to increased demand for advertising  effective ongoing operating expense management and the positive impact from eliminating amortization of certain intangible assets under sfas the decline was due to slowing economic conditions and lost revenues due to the september th event 
combined revenues for radio and television increased in and decreased in  reflecting solid increases in demand for local advertising and substantial political advertising in excluding the impact of political revenues  combined revenues from radio and television increased in and decreased in revenues from sports operations decreased and in and  reflecting a hesitancy of the market to enter into the longer term structure of sports advertising contracts 
broadcast cash flow increased in and decreased in the increase was due to improved profitability at our radio and tv properties  though these increases were partially offset by weak results in our sports basketball product earlier in the year 
total expenses  excluding interest expense  increased in and decreased in as a percent of communication revenues  these expenses were  and for  and the improvement reflects continued expense discipline combined with the elimination of fcc license and goodwill amortization under sfas in the current year 
this amortization expense was for and a one time insurance recovery of after tax reduced corporate general and administrative expenses in  which improved segment earnings  but is not reflected in broadcast cash flow 
because broadcasting stations rely on advertising revenues  they are sensitive to cyclical changes in both the general economy and in the economic strength of their local markets 
furthermore  our stations derived of their advertising revenues from the automotive industry in if automobile advertising is seriously curtailed  it could have a negative impact on broadcasting revenues 
radio and television stations require a license from the fcc to operate with periodic renewal 
while failure to renew is unlikely  any station that failed to receive renewal would be forced to cease operations and could no longer generate revenue 
technology and consolidation in the broadcast industry may increase competition for audiences and advertisers 
corporate and other the corporate and other segment includes the excess capital of the insurance subsidiaries  other corporate investments including all our impaired securities  benefit plan net assets  goodwill related to insurance acquisitions  and corporate debt 
the reportable segment results primarily contain the earnings on the invested excess capital  interest expense related to the corporate debt  and operating expenses that are corporate in nature such as advertising and charitable and civic contributions 
all net capital gains and losses  which include all impairments of securities  are reported in this segment 
the following table summarizes results for this segment earnings on investments interest expense on debt and exchangeable securities operating expenses provision for income tax expense benefit total expenses reportable segment results before dividends on capital securities and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock dividends on capital securities and mandatorily redeemable preferred stock reportable segment results realized investment losses gains  net reportable segment results  including realized losses gains reportable segment results excluding realized gains losses decreased in and increased in several items impacted the corporate and other segment results including a decline in earnings on investments due to lost income on defaulted securities and funds used for share repurchases  lower interest expense on debt and exchangeable securities and an increase in accruals for litigation 
the earnings on investments for the segment include default charge income received from the operating segments for the corporate and other segment s assumption of all credit related losses on the invested assets of those segments 
default charges were  and for  and and are calculated as a percentage of the invested assets 
earnings on investments in this segment can fluctuate based upon opportunistic repurchases of common stock  the amount of excess capital generated by the operating segments and lost investment income on bonds impaired or sold at a loss 
interest expense on debt and exchangeable securities decreased in primarily due to lower market interest rates  the replacement of the meds securities with short term borrowings in january and overall lower amounts outstanding 
see note that more fully addresses our debt structure and interest costs 
operating expenses vary with the level of corporate activities and strategies 
in  we increased our accrual for litigation by taking into consideration the status of pending litigation  including several class action lawsuits 
in march  we announced that a north carolina judge had authorized us to send a notice to participating class policyholders that an agreement had been reached with plaintiff s counsel to settle one of the existing class action suits 
the settlement is subject to final approval by the court 
management believes its current accruals for litigation expense are adequate 
goodwill amortization of and  excluding jpcc  was included in operating expenses in this segment for and but has been eliminated in under sfas note details the pro forma effect that goodwill amortization would have in the provision for income tax expense includes the tax benefit of preferred dividends on capital securities  which we record gross of related tax effects 
income taxes decreased in and in the decline is primarily due to lower pretax segment income while the decline is due to the implementation of strategies that reduced federal income taxes on investment earnings and the resolution of tax issues for which we had previously established provisions 
realized investment gains and losses were as follows bonds gains bond losses bond impairment charges stock gains net other losses gross realized losses gains less taxes net realized losses gains the following table summarizes assets assigned to this segment 
parent company  passive investment companies and corporate line assets of insurance subsidiaries unrealized gain on fixed interest investments co insurance receivables on acquired blocks   employee benefit plan assets goodwill arising from insurance acquisitions other total   total assets for the corporate and other segment increased in due primarily to unrealized gains on fixed interest investments 
unrealized gains and losses on all available for sale fixed income securities are assigned to this segment  and increased and in and risks for this segment include investment impairments due to continuing economic weakness or further economic decline  the risk of rising interest rates on our short term debt  the ability to replace existing debt agreements with comparable terms  an additional decline in the value of our equity securities which would limit our potential for gains  the general uncertainty regarding litigation  and the potential for future impairment of goodwill 
additionally  as discussed in the liquidity section  to service our debt and to pay shareholder dividends  this segment relies on excess cash flows through dividends from the insurance subsidiaries 
these dividends are dependent upon regulatory approval above certain limits 
financial position our primary resources are investments related to our individual products  aip and benefit partners segments  properties and other assets utilized in all segments and investments backing corporate capital 
this section identifies several items on our balance sheet that are important to the overall understanding of our financial position 
the investments section reviews our investment portfolio and key portfolio management strategies 
total assets increased  in and  in due to growth in investment income  net policyholder contract deposits  and unrealized gains on investments  all of which more than offset declines in fair values of separate account assets  dividends  stock repurchases and impairment losses 
intangible assets on our balance sheet include dac  voba and goodwill 
dac and voba the individual products  aip and benefit partners segments defer the costs of acquiring new business  including first year commissions  first year bonus interest or day one premium bonuses on annuities  certain costs of underwriting and issuing policies plus agency office expenses  referred to as dac 
we limit our capitalization of acquisition costs other than commissions to the lower of product specific pricing allowables or the actual deferrable acquisition costs 
when we acquire new business through an acquisition  we allocate a portion of the purchase price to a separately identifiable intangible asset  referred to as voba 
we initially establish voba as the actuarially determined present value of future gross profits of each business acquired 
both dac and voba are amortized through expenses as revenues are recognized in the future 
some of the assumptions regarding future experience that can affect the carrying value of dac and voba balances include mortality  interest spreads  lapse rates and policy fees earned 
significant changes in these assumptions can impact the carrying balance of dac and voba and therefore produce changes that must be reflected in earnings 
these changes can be positive or negative 
we amortize dac and voba on traditional products in proportion to premium revenue recognized 
the dac and voba balances on these products were or of the gross balances at december   and are generally subject to little volatility 
we amortize dac and voba on ul type products and annuity products relative to the future estimated gross profits egp from those products 
in calculating the egp for these products  management must make assumptions regarding the following components estimates of fees charged to policyholders to cover mortality  surrenders and maintenance costs  estimated mortality in excess of fund balances accumulated  expected interest rate spreads between income earned and amounts credited to policyholder accounts  and estimated costs of policy administration maintenance 
dac and voba calculations are sensitive to a change in our assumptions regarding egp components  and any significant change in these assumptions will immediately impact the current dac and voba balances with the change reflected through the income statement 
we continuously review the models and our assumptions regarding egp that we use for calculation of amortization expense for these products so that the assumptions reflect management s view of future events 
we consider the following assumptions to be most significant to ul type products estimated mortality  estimated interest spreads  and estimated future policy lapses 
dac and voba on ul type products were  or of the gross balances at december  in addition to these three assumptions on all ul type products  vul products and va products contain an additional assumption that affects the dac and voba amortization 
this critical assumption is the rate of growth of the separate account mutual funds that generate additional policy fees utilized in the egp on vul and va products 
we assume a long term total net return on separate account assets  including dividends and market value increases  of and a five year reversion period 
the reversion period is a period over which a short term return assumption is used to maintain the model s overall long term rate of return 
we capped the reversion rate of return at for one year and for years two through five 
the effect of this limitation was to reduce the cumulative effective long term rate at this point in time to less than 
our decision to cap the first year reversion and to limit our overall reversion rate reflects recent declines in equity markets and a lower than historic allocation of fund assets by our policyholders to equity funds

under sfas  we test goodwill for impairment at least on an annual basis  and we concluded that there had been no impairments in goodwill was at december  and and and as a percentage of shareholders equity at these dates 
we regularly review the carrying amounts for indications of value impairment  considering financial performance and other relevant factors such as a significant adverse change in the business or legal climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  or unanticipated competition

the individual products  aip and benefit partners segments are subject to regulatory constraints 
our insurance subsidiaries have statutory surplus and risk based capital levels well above required levels

standard poor s also kept in effect their negative outlook for jefferson pilot and the life insurance industry as a whole 
in  fitch ratings downgraded our major life insurance affiliates ratings to aa  the agency s second highest rating  along with numerous other companies in the financial services industry 
this action by fitch has not had a perceptible effect on us  but a very significant drop in our ratings  while not anticipated  could potentially impact future sales and or accelerate surrenders on our business in force 
short term borrowings and debt we have bank credit agreements for unsecured revolving credit  under which we have the option to borrow at various interest rates 
in may  we replaced an expiring bank credit agreement with new unsecured revolving credit agreements  currently aggregating  half available for five years and half available for days 
the credit agreements principally support our issuance of commercial paper 
outstanding commercial paper had various maturities  with at december  in excess of days  although maturities can be up to days 
if we cannot remarket commercial paper at maturity  we have sufficient liquidity  consisting of the bank credit agreements  liquid assets  such as equity securities  and other resources to retire these obligations

our insurance subsidiaries have sold us treasury obligations and collateralized mortgage obligations under repurchase agreements involving various counterparties  accounted for as financing arrangements 
we may use proceeds to purchase securities with longer durations as an asset liability management strategy 
we also may use repurchase agreements from time to time in lieu of commercial paper borrowings

the securities involved had a fair value and amortized cost of and at december  versus and at december  the maximum principal amounts outstanding were and during and liquidity we meet liquidity requirements primarily by positive cash flows from the operations of subsidiaries 
we have sufficient overall sources of liquidity to satisfy operating requirements 
primary sources of cash from our insurance operations are premiums  other insurance considerations  receipts for policyholder accounts  investment sales and maturities and investment income 
primary uses of cash for our insurance operations include purchases of investments  payment of insurance benefits  operating expenses  withdrawals from policyholder accounts  costs related to acquiring new business  dividends and income taxes 
primary sources of cash from the communications operations are revenues from broadcast advertising  and primary uses include payments for commissions  compensation and related costs  sports rights  interest  income taxes and purchases of fixed assets 
cash provided by operations in  and was  and the primary reason for the large swings was approximately of single premiums that were received pending policy issuance in late and reported as cash received from operations in that year

in order to meet the parent company s dividend payments  debt servicing obligations and other expenses  we receive dividends from subsidiaries 
subsidiaries paid total cash dividends of  and in  and our life insurance subsidiaries are subject to laws in their states of domicile that limit the amount of dividends that can be paid without the prior approval of the respective state s insurance regulator 
the limits are based in part on the prior year s statutory income and capital  which are negatively impacted by bond losses and write downs 
approval of these dividends will depend upon the circumstances at the time  but we have not experienced problems with state approvals in the past 
cash and cash equivalents were  and at december   and the decrease from reflects the build up of cash used to pay off the meds in january the parent company and non regulated subsidiaries held equity and fixed income securities of  and at these dates

jpcc has commitments for purchases of syndicated television programming and commitments on other contracts and future sports programming rights of approximately as of december   payable through the year we have commitments to sell a portion of the sports programming rights to other entities for over the same period 
these commitments are not reflected as an asset or liability in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet because the programs are not currently available for use 
we expect advertising revenues that are sold on an annual basis to fund the purchase commitments 
we routinely enter into commitments to extend credit in the form of mortgage loans and to purchase certain debt instruments in private placement transactions for our investment portfolio 
the fair value of such outstanding commitments as of december  approximates these commitments will be funded through cash flows from operations and investment maturities 
investments portfolio description our strategy for managing the investment portfolio of our insurance subsidiaries is to consistently meet pricing assumptions while appropriately managing credit risk 
we invest for the long term  and most of our investments are held until they mature 
our investment portfolio includes primarily fixed income securities and commercial mortgage loans 
the nature and quality of investments our insurance subsidiaries hold must comply with state regulatory requirements 
we have established a formal investment policy  which describes our overall quality and diversification objectives and limits 
the following table shows the carrying values of our invested assets 
approximately of our portfolio has been designated as available for sale afs and is carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
we determine fair values of our securities  including securities not actively traded  using the methodology described in the critical accounting policies section above 
changes in fair values of afs securities are reflected in other comprehensive income 
the remainder of our portfolio has been designated as held to maturity htm 
as prescribed by generally accepted accounting principles  htm securities are carried at amortized cost  and accordingly there will be a difference between fair value and carrying value for htm securities

in addition  we witnessed significant deterioration in credit ratings throughout the year 
industries that were particularly affected included passenger airlines  communications  energy and technology 
credit spreads increased considerably  resulting in significantly lower market values on bonds in these sectors 
as noted above  credit risk is inherent in our bond portfolio 
we manage this risk through a structured approach in which we assess the effects of the changing economic landscape 
we devote a significant amount of effort of both highly specialized  well trained internal resources and external experts in our approach to managing credit risk 
in identifying potentially distressed securities we first screen for all securities that have a fair value to amortized cost ratio of less than 
however  as part of this identification process  management must make assumptions and judgments using the following information current fair value of the security compared to amortized cost length of time the fair value was below amortized cost industry factors or conditions related to a geographic area that are negatively affecting the security downgrades by a rating agency past due interest or principal payments or other violation of covenants deterioration of the overall financial condition of the specific issuer in analyzing securities for other than temporary impairments  we then pay special attention to securities that have been potentially distressed for a period greater than six months 
we assume that  absent reliable contradictory evidence  a security that is potentially distressed for a continuous period greater than twelve months has incurred an other than temporary impairment 
such reliable contradictory evidence might include  among other factors  a liquidation analysis performed by our investment professionals and consultants  improving financial performance or valuation of underlying assets specifically pledged to support the credit 
when we identify a security as potentially impaired  we add it to our potentially distressed security list and determine if the impairment is other than temporary 
various committees comprised of senior management and investment analysts intensively review the potentially distressed security list to determine if a security is deemed to be other than temporarily impaired 
in this review  we consider the following criteria fundamental analysis of the liquidity and financial condition of the specific issuer underlying valuation of assets specifically pledged to support the credit time period in which the fair value has been significantly below amortized cost industry sector or geographic area applicable to the specific issuer our ability and intent to retain the investment for a sufficient time to recover its value when this intensive review determines that the decline is other than temporary based on management s judgment  the security is written down to fair value through a charge to realized investment gains and losses and is moved to the corporate and other segment 
we adjust the amortized cost for both afs and htm securities that have experienced other than temporary impairments to reflect fair value at the time of the impairment 
we consider factors that lead to an other than temporary impairment of a particular security in order to determine whether these conditions have impacted other similar securities 
below investment grade securities we monitor those securities that are rated below investment grade as to individual exposures and in comparison to the entire portfolio  as an additional credit risk management strategy 
the following table shows the ten largest below investment grade debt security exposures by individual issuer at december  gross amortized unrealized creditor sector cost carrying value loss el paso utilities rite aid consumer cyclical intertape polymer group basic materials qwest communications communications williams companies utilities carolina tractor equipment capital goods american airlines transportation delta airlines transportation allied waste utilities mirant energy bonds of these issuers that are investment grade are not included in these values

at december  and  below investment grade bonds were  or and  or of the carrying value of the bond portfolio 
these are higher than our historical exposures 
we are currently managing our below investment grade bonds to reduce our exposure as a percentage of the total portfolio over time 
unrealized gains and losses the majority of our unrealized gains and losses can be attributed to changes in interest rates and market changes in credit spreads  which have caused temporary price fluctuations 
however  within the specific bonds with unrealized losses  we further stratify and analyze them as discussed above to determine if the unrealized loss is other than temporary 
the following table summarizes by category the unrealized gains and losses in our entire securities portfolios  including common stock and redeemable preferred stock  as of december  gross gross amortized unrealized unrealized fair carrying cost gains losses value value available for sale  carried at fair value us treasury obligations and direct obligations of us government agencies federal agency mortgage backed securities including collateralized mortgage obligations    obligations of states and political subdivisions corporate obligations    corporate private labeled mortgage backed securities including collateralized mortgage obligations    redeemable preferred stock subtotal  debt securities     non redeemable preferred stock common stock securities available for sale     held to maturity  carried at amortized cost obligations of state and political subdivisions corporate obligations    debt securities held to maturity    total afs and htm securities     these unrealized gains and losses do not necessarily represent future gains or losses that we will realize

of this amount  had been continuously included in our potentially distressed securities list for more than twelve months 
information about unrealized gains and losses is subject to rapidly changing conditions 
securities with unrealized gains and losses will fluctuate  as will those securities that we have identified as potentially distressed 
the recent volatility of financial markets and declines in market interest rates has led to an increase in both unrealized gains and losses 
we consider all of the factors discussed earlier when we determine if an unrealized loss is other than temporary  including our ability and intent to hold the security until the value recovers 
our current evaluation of other than temporary impairments reflects our positive intent to hold certain securities until maturity 
however  we may subsequently decide to sell certain of these securities in future periods within the overall context of our portfolio management strategies 
if we make the decision to dispose of a security with an unrealized loss  we will write down the security to its fair value if we have not sold it by the end of the reporting period 
realized losses write downs and sales realized losses are comprised of both write downs on other than temporary impairments and actual sales of securities 
in we had other than temporary impairments on bonds of as compared to for the individual impairments in excess of  how they were measured  the circumstances giving rise to the losses  and the impact those circumstances have on other material investments we held at the time are as follows write down of manufactured housing debt that was secured by long term mortgages on mobile homes and a corporate guarantee from the manufacturer and underwriter of the underlying collateral 
the manufacturer filed for chapter bankruptcy protection rendering the corporate guarantee essentially worthless 
in addition  we concluded that projected cash flows of the underlying collateral may be insufficient based on third party valuations 
this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down of securitized refinanced hud residential loans that also carried a corporate guarantee from the finance company that made the underlying loans 
the finance company filed for chapter bankruptcy protection  which left us unable to collect under the corporate guarantee 
again  we concluded that projected cash flows of the underlying collateral may be insufficient based on third party valuations 
this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down on debt of worldcom  inc  which filed for bankruptcy in july 
this issuer had specific problems with accounting restatements and potentially questionable business practices 
the entire telecommunications sector has been under pressure due to overcapacity 
we then sold these securities in we specifically looked at other creditors in this sector including several on our potentially distressed security list and determined that at this point  the unrealized losses on securities we hold of other material creditors are temporary 
write down related to united airlines equipment trust certificates 
this airline filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
this had no impact on other holdings in our portfolio 
write down on debt of nrg energy that defaulted due to liquidity issues brought upon by rapid ratings downgrades 
we then sold these securities in the bulk of our holdings in the utilities sector are regulated utility bonds 
however  we did review our exposure to unregulated companies  whose bonds are typically lower rated and display greater risk profile than regulated companies 
in this review we did not identify any other write downs 
write down on unsecured debt of burlington industries 
the textile manufacturer had been suffering from liquidity issues and filed for chapter bankruptcy protection 
we reviewed our exposure to securities issued by other textile manufacturers and did not identify any other write downs 
this security was sold in at a price equal to book value 
there were no individual impairments in excess of for the other write downs resulting from other than temporary impairments in all years were spread across many different sectors and related to specific issuer circumstances 
the majority of write downs in were in the transportation  energy and telecommunications sectors 
in  we incurred losses of on sales of securities 
the only individually material realized loss that occurred in from a sale of securities was an loss on debt of williams cos  inc  which suffered significant credit downgrades within a short period 
the other realized losses from sales of securities were individually less than these disposals were in accordance with established portfolio management strategies and did not previously meet the criteria for other than temporary impairment 
mortgage backed securities mortgage backed securities including commercial mortgage backed securities at december  and  all of which are included in debt securities available for sale  were as follows federal agency issued mortgage backed securities   corporate private labeled mortgage backed securities   total   our investment strategy with respect to mortgage backed securities mbs portfolio focuses on actively traded issues with less volatile cash flows 
the majority of the mbs holdings are sequential and planned amortization class tranches of federal agency issuers 
the mbs portfolio has been constructed with underlying mortgage collateral characteristics and structure in order to mitigate cash flow volatility over a range of interest rates 
because of the steep decline in interest rates to record lows  the mortgage market has experienced record levels of refinancings and the structural protection of our mbs portfolio has eroded 
we experienced prepayments on mortgage backed securities totaling  or of the average carrying value of the mbs portfolio in  which exceeded our expectations 
our mbs portfolio is primarily a discount portfolio  therefore  larger than expected prepayments accelerated the amortization of income in also  pursuant to sfas  we adjusted our long term prepayment speeds for the calculation of effective yields on a retrospective basis as a result of these prepayments 
these two factors increased investment income by after tax 
further  these repayments are reinvested at yields that are lower than our current portfolio yields  producing less investment income going forward 
the decline in interest rates has continued into  and we have continued to receive additional prepayments 
mortgage loans we record mortgage loans on real property net of an allowance for credit losses 
this allowance includes both reserve amounts for specific loans that are believed to be at a higher risk of becoming impaired in the near future  and a general reserve that is calculated by review of historical industry loan loss statistics 
we consider future cash flows and the probability of payment when we calculate our specific loan loss reserve 
at december  and  our allowances for mortgage loan credit losses were and derivative instruments our guidelines permit use of derivative financial instruments such as futures contracts and interest rate swaps in conjunction with specific direct investments 
our actual use of derivatives through december  has been limited to managing well defined interest rate risks 
interest rate swaps utilized in our asset liability management strategy with a current notional value of and were open as of december  and during  we began using interest rate swaps to hedge future bond purchases that will back deposits on certain annuity contracts 
this hedging strategy protects the spread between the annuity crediting rate offered at the time the annuities are sold and the income that will eventually be earned on bonds that will back annuity contracts issued 
these interest rates contracts are generally terminated within a month 
effective august   we now purchase s p index r options in association with our current sales of equity indexed annuities 
the reinsurance agreement on previously issued equity indexed annuities remains in existence 
market risk exposures since our assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  our financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities  changes in the yield curve  and equity price risks 
during  year us treasury rates decreased basis points versus an increase of basis points in in a falling interest rate environment  the risk of prepayment on some fixed income securities increases and funds prepaid are then reinvested at lower yields 
we limit this risk by concentrating the fixed income portfolio mainly on non callable securities  by selecting mbs s that are structured to minimize cash flow volatility and by purchasing securities that provide for make whole type prepayment fees 
falling interest rates can also impact demand for our products  as bank certificates of deposit with no surrender charges and higher average returns from equity markets may become more attractive to new and existing customers 
conversely  in a rising interest rate environment  competitive pressures may make it difficult for us to sustain spreads between rates credited on interest sensitive products and portfolio earnings rates  thereby prompting withdrawals by policyholders 
we manage these risks by adjusting our interest crediting rates with due regard to the yield of our investment portfolio  minimum rate guarantees and pricing assumptions and by prudently managing interest rate risk of assets and liabilities 
as is typical in the industry  our life and annuity products contain minimum rate guarantees regarding interest we credit 
for interest sensitive life products  our minimum rates range from approximately to  with an approximate weighted average of 
for annuity products  our minimum rates range from to  with the greatest concentration in the to range 
we employ various methodologies to manage our exposure to interest rate risks 
our asset liability management process focuses primarily on the management of interest rate risk of our insurance operations 
we monitor the duration of insurance liabilities compared to the duration of assets backing the insurance lines  measuring the optionality of cash flows 
our goal in this analysis is to prudently balance profitability and risk for each insurance product category  and for us as a whole 
at december  and  of policy liabilities related to interest sensitive portfolios 
we also consider the timing of cash flows arising from market risk sensitive instruments and insurance portfolios under varying interest rate scenarios as well as the related impact on reported earnings under those varying scenarios 
market risk sensitive instruments include debt and equity securities available for sale and held to maturity including mbs securities  mortgage loans  policy loans  investment commitments  annuities in the accumulation phase and periodic payment annuities  commercial paper borrowings  repurchase agreements and interest rate swaps 
we have derived estimated incremental loss amounts by modeling estimated cash flows of our market risk sensitive instruments and insurance portfolios 
incremental income or loss is net of taxes at 
the model also assumes that all short term debt consisting of commercial paper and reverse repurchase agreements are replaced with similar instruments 
estimated cash flows produced in the model assume reinvestments representative of our current investment strategy  and calls prepayments include scheduled maturities as well as those expected to occur when borrowers can benefit financially based on the difference between prepayment penalties and new money rates under each scenario 
assumed lapse rates within insurance portfolios consider the relationships expected between crediting rates and market interest rates  as well as the level of surrender charges inherent in individual contracts 
the illustrated incremental income or loss also includes the expected impact on amortization of dac and voba 
the model is based on our existing business in force as of december  and does not consider new sales of life and annuity products or the potential impact of interest rate fluctuations on sales 
the following table shows our estimate of the impact that various hypothetical interest rate scenarios would have on our earnings for a single year  based on the assumptions in our model 
we believe that  based upon historically low current interest rates  a symmetrical change in interest rates is not reasonably possible 
our model shows the effect on income with an increase up to basis points and a decrease in basis points 
we believe that the basis point increase or basis point decrease  experienced gradually over four quarters  reflects reasonably possible near term changes in interest rates as of december  the incremental loss for a year derives primarily from differences in the yield curves and in the sensitivities they introduce to our model 
estimated incremental change in interest rate single year loss basis points basis points basis points basis points generally  an increase in interest rates will benefit our earnings in the insurance portfolio  yet increase our interest expense on short term debt 
conversely  a decrease in interest rates will decrease earnings from the insurance portfolio as minimum rate guarantees would begin to take effect and or competitive conditions would not permit us to reduce crediting rates  while we would benefit from the decline in interest expense on our short term debt 
changes in interest rates for a single year illustrated above assume shifts in the yield curve  graded pro rata over four quarters 
the model also assumes that changes in our crediting rates will occur correspondingly with declines or increases in investment yields 
the above table reflects the effect on one year 
a spike in interest rates of basis points that lasts for three years would produce a significantly larger estimated loss in the second and third years  as policyholders would potentially seek more attractive rates elsewhere 
correspondingly  a larger than basis point decrease would cause a significantly larger estimated loss in the single year and cumulatively  as minimum rate guarantees would prohibit us from lowering credited rates on most products 
the incremental income or loss for shifts in excess of those shown or that occur more quickly than quarterly grading does not have a linear relationship to the values shown above 
the incremental loss resulting from a higher change in interest rates would be proportionally greater due to the optionality of our interest sensitive assets and liabilities 
in contrast  the incremental income resulting from a greater decrease in interest rates would be proportionally less due to the effect of minimum rate guarantees in our interest sensitive liabilities 
a significant change in the slope of the yield curve could also affect our results 
for example  competing products such as bank cds could become relatively more attractive than our longer duration annuities under an inverted yield curve  resulting in higher policyholder withdrawals 
an anticipated increase in interest rates could also suggest that we would term out some of the short term debt  which the model does not take into consideration 
we are exposed to equity price risk on our equity securities other than trading 
we hold common stock with a fair value of  approximately is in a single issuer  bank of america corporation bankamerica 
we believe that a hypothetical decline in the equity market is possible in the near term 
if the market value of the s p index  and of bankamerica common stock specifically  decreased  the fair value of our common stock as of december  would change as follows hypothetical change in fair value from market decline bankamerica common stock remaining equity securities total change in fair values certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated  but may be subject to changes in fair values which are reflected in equity 
note presents additional disclosures concerning fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities 
external trends and forward looking information we operate within the united states financial services and broadcasting markets  which are both subject to general economic conditions 
interest rates on longer maturity debt instruments began trending down in late as economic growth slowed and have continued to drop dramatically especially in and early additional changes in rates may affect our businesses in many ways as discussed earlier in the market risk exposure section 
as noted in the investment section  the prolonged decline in general economic conditions has increased our credit risk 
a prolonged period of further declining or even level interest rates in their current position would have an impact on our individual and aip segments 
investments purchased for those segments yielding rates lower than our current portfolio rates will lower our overall portfolio earned rates 
in the individual and aip segments  there are minimum crediting rates on policyholder accounts inherent in the insurance portfolio due to both product guarantees and various state requirements 
our inability to reduce crediting rates in response to the declines in earned rates would result in a significant negative impact on future earnings 
furthermore  a continued general economic weakness would cause deterioration in our balance sheet and our overall future profitability 
our operations are also affected over the longer term by demographic shifts  global markets  technological innovation and overall capital market volatility 
these forces impact us in various ways such as demand for our insurance products and advertising revenues  competition from other financial services providers  competition from emerging technologies for television and radio advertising  competition for new investments  debt costs  mergers and consolidations within the financial services and communications sectors  and costs inherent in administering complex financial products 
demographic changes include the aging of the baby boomers  reaching their high earning years at a time when investment yields from both equities and fixed rate products are at historically low points 
this challenge has been met by the insurance industry by offering various types of fixed and variable products aimed at this population 
the industry s overall individual life insurance sales in the us increased for and reflected a trend towards those financial products with a fixed rate given the volatility in the equity markets 
as discussed previously  our individual life sales growth continues to be better than the overall industry 
regulatory and legal environment the us insurance industry has experienced mergers  acquisitions  consolidations  sales of business lines and marketing arrangements with other financial services providers 
these activities have been driven by a need to reduce costs of distribution and to increase economies of scale in the face of growing competition from larger insurers  banks  securities brokers  mutual funds and other non traditional competitors 
we expect further strategic alignments in the financial services industry given changing demographics  technological advances  customer expectations for one stop shopping  and the modernization of the regulatory framework for financial services under the gramm leach bliley act 
we continue to analyze our options within this environment for increasing distribution  adding products and technology and improving economies of scale
