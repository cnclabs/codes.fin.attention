item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview adtran designs  develops  manufactures  markets  and services a broad range of high speed network access products utilized by providers of telecommunications services serviced by our carrier networks division and corporate end users serviced by our enterprise networks division 
we currently sell our products to a large number of carriers  including all regional bell operating companies rbocs  and to private and public enterprises worldwide 
sales decreased this year compared to last year due to an overall downturn in the telecommunications market 
however  we believe we have protected our sources of revenue by maintaining our strategy of increasing unit volume and market share through the introduction of succeeding generations of products having lower selling prices and increased functionality as compared to both the prior generation of a product and to the products of competitors 
an important part of adtran s strategy is to engineer the reduction of the product cost of each succeeding product generation and then to lower the product s price based on the cost savings achieved 
as a part of this strategy  we seek in most instances to be a high quality  low cost provider of products in our markets 
adtran s success to date is attributable in large measure to our ability to design our products initially with a view to their subsequent redesign  allowing both increased functionality and reduced manufacturing costs in each succeeding product generation 
this strategy enables adtran to sell succeeding generations of products to existing customers  while increasing our market share by selling these enhanced products to new customers 
our operating results have fluctuated on a quarterly basis in the past  and operating results may vary significantly in future periods due to a number of factors 
we operate with very little order backlog 
a majority of our sales in each quarter result from orders booked in that quarter and firm purchase orders released in that quarter by customers under agreements containing non binding purchase commitments 
furthermore  a majority of customers typically require prompt delivery of products 
this results in a limited backlog of orders for these products and requires us to maintain sufficient inventory levels to satisfy anticipated customer demand 
if near term demand for adtran s products declines  or if potential sales in any quarter do not occur as anticipated  our financial results could be adversely affected 
operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  therefore  a shortfall in quarterly revenues could significantly impact adtran s financial results in a given quarter 
further  maintaining sufficient inventory levels to assure prompt delivery of our products increases the amount of inventory which may become obsolete and increases the risk that the obsolescence of such inventory may have an adverse effect on our business and operating results 
adtran s operating results may also fluctuate as a result of a number of other factors  including increased competition  customer order patterns  changes in product mix  timing differences between price decreases and product cost reductions  product warranty returns  and announcements of new products by adtran or our competitors 
accordingly  adtran s historical financial performance is not necessarily a meaningful indicator of future results  and  in general  management expects that adtran s financial results may vary from period to period 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our financial statements 
these policies have been consistently applied across our two reportable segments carrier networks division and enterprise networks division 
we review customer contracts to determine if all of the requirements for revenue recognition have been met prior to recording revenues from sales transactions 
we generally record sales revenue upon shipment of our products  net of any discounts  since i we generally do not have significant post delivery obligations  ii the product price is fixed and determinable  iii collection of the resulting receivable is probable  and iv product returns are reasonably estimable 
we generally ship products upon receipt of a purchase order from a customer 
we evaluate shipping terms and we record revenue on products shipped in accordance with the applicable terms of each respective contract 
we participate in cooperative advertising and market development programs with certain customers 
we use these programs to reimburse customers for certain forms of advertising and to provide sales incentives  and in general  to allow our customers credits up to a specified percentage of their net purchases 
our costs associated with these programs are estimated and accrued at the time of sale  and are included in either marketing expenses or as a reduction of sales in our consolidated statements of income 
sales returns are accrued based on historical sales return experience  which we believe provides a reasonable estimate of future returns 
product returns are generally only permitted by customers who purchase our products under specific sales agreements that govern their rights of return 
prior to accepting a new customer  we perform a detailed credit review of the customer 
credit limits are established for each new customer based on the results of this credit review 
payment terms are established for each new customer  and future collection experience is reviewed periodically in order 
table of contents to determine if the customer s payment terms and credit limits need to be revised 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial conditions of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  we may be required to make additional allowances 
if circumstances change with regard to individual receivable balances that had previously been determined to be uncollectible and for which a specific reserve had been established  a reduction in our allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was  and  at december  and  respectively 
we recorded   and  of bad debt expense during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we carry our inventory at the lower of cost or market  with cost being determined using the first in  first out method 
we use standard costs for material  labor  and manufacturing overhead to value our inventory 
our standard costs are rolled forward on a monthly basis 
therefore  our inventory costs approximate actual costs at the end of each reporting period 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the cost of inventory or the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  we may be required to make additional inventory write downs 
our reserve for excess and obsolete inventory was  and  at december  and  respectively 
inventory write downs were   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the objective of our short term investment policy is to preserve principal and maintain adequate liquidity with appropriate diversification  while emphasizing market returns on our monetary assets 
the objective of our long term investment policy is to emphasize total return  that is  the aggregate return from capital appreciation  dividend income  and interest income 
this is achieved through investments with appropriate diversification in fixed and variable rate income  public equity  and private equity portfolios 
during we changed our fixed income investment policy  shortening the maximum maturity from years to five and a one half years  with consistent dollar maturities  year to year 
we have experienced significant volatility in the market prices of our publicly traded equity investments 
these investments are recorded on the consolidated balance sheets at fair value with unrealized gains and losses reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss  net of tax 
the ultimate realized value on these equity investments is subject to market price volatility until they are sold 
we review our investment portfolio for potential other than temporary declines in value on an individual investment basis 
we assess  on a quarterly basis  significant declines in value which may be considered other than temporary and  if necessary  recognize and record the appropriate charge to write down the carrying value of such investments 
in making this assessment  we take into consideration a wide range of objective and subjective information  including but not limited to the following the magnitude and duration of historical decline in market prices  credit rating activity  assessments of liquidity  public filings  and statements made by the issuer 
we generally begin our identification of potential other than temporary impairments by reviewing any security with a market value that has declined from its original or adjusted cost basis by for more than six months 
we then evaluate the individual security based on the previously identified factors to determine the amount of the write down  if any 
actual losses  if any  could ultimately differ from these estimates 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in additional losses that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
for  and  we recorded other than temporary write downs of our marketable equity investments of  and  respectively 
these write downs are included in net realized investment gains losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
we also invest in privately held entities and record our investments in these entities at cost 
we review our investments in these entities periodically in order to determine if circumstances both financial and non financial exist that indicate that we will not recover our initial investment 
impairment charges are recorded on investments having a cost basis that is greater than the value that we would reasonably expect to receive in an arm s length sale of the investment 
for  and  we recorded write downs of our cost basis investments of   and  respectively 
these write downs are included in net realized investment gains losses in the accompanying consolidated statements of income

the incentive program enables participating companies to generate alabama corporate income tax credits that can be used to reduce the amount of alabama corporate income taxes that would otherwise be payable 
we cannot be certain that the state of alabama will continue to make these corporate income tax credits available in the future  and therefore  we may not realize the full benefit of these incentives 
through december   the authority had issued  of its taxable revenue bonds pursuant to the incentive program and loaned the proceeds from the sale of the bonds to adtran
