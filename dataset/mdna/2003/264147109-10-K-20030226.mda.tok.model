critical accounting policies revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determinable  collection is reasonably assured and delivery of products has occurred or services have been rendered 
the company records provisions for estimated losses on contracts in the period in which such losses are identified 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses from the inability of customers to make required payments 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is evaluated periodically based on the aging of accounts receivable  the financial condition of customers and their payment history  historical write off experience and other assumptions 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  cost being determined on a first in  first out basis

if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  such as an unanticipated decline in demand not meeting expectations  inventory write downs may be required 
property and depreciation property and equipment  including assets recorded under capital leases  are recorded at cost 
depreciation and amortization are computed using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives ranging from to years and  in the case of leasehold improvements  over the shorter of the lives of the improvements or the lease term 
the company periodically evaluates long lived assets for recoverability  when significant changes in conditions occur  and recognizes impairment losses  if any  based upon the fair value of the assets 
goodwill the company s business acquisitions have typically resulted in goodwill  which affects the amount of possible impairment expense that the company will incur 
the determination of the value of goodwill requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the company s consolidated financial statements

the company continues to depend on operating cash flow and the availability of its bank line of credit to provide short term liquidity 
cash from operations and bank borrowing capacity are expected to provide sufficient liquidity to meet the company s obligations during in december  the company and its lenders amended the company s credit agreement 
the amended credit agreement provides for a  unsecured revolving credit line gradually declining to  at maturity on september  interest is payable monthly on the outstanding borrowings based on the bank s prime rate plus a spread based on the leverage ratio of the company calculated at the end of each fiscal quarter at december

the carrying amount of long term debt approximates fair value based on the terms of the related debt  recent transactions and estimates using interest rates currently available to the company for debt with similar terms and remaining maturities 
aggregate maturities of long term debt during the next five years are as follows         as part of the acquisition of composite structures  described in note  in june  the company assumed the assets and liabilities of a defined benefit plan covering certain hourly employees of composite structures 
pension plan benefits are generally determined on the basis of the retiree s age and length of service 
assets of the defined benefit plan are composed primarily of fixed income and equity securities 
on december   the company s annual measurement date  the accumulated benefit obligation  related to the company s composite structures subsidiary pension plan  exceeded the fair value of the pension plan assets 
such excess is referred to as an unfunded accumulated benefit obligation 
this difference is attributed to an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation that resulted from a decrease in the interest rate used to discount the accumulated benefit obligation to its present settlement amount from to and a decline in the fair value of the plan assets due to a sharp decrease in the equity markets at december  as a result  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the company recognized a minimum pension liability of  net of tax which decreased shareholders equity and is included in other long term liabilities 
this charge to shareholders equity represents a net loss not yet recognized as pension expense

additionally  as a result of potential underfunded status of the pension plan  pension expense will be approximately  in compared to  in composite structures  was not required to make any contributions to its pension plan in but plans to contribute as much as  in in october  the company sold the capital stock of its airline seating manufacturing subsidiary  brice  for  in cash 
the company recorded a charge of  net of taxes  or per diluted share  in for the loss on the sale 
the company expects to spend less than  for capital expenditures in the company believes that the ongoing subcontractor consolidation makes acquisitions an increasingly important component of the company s future growth 
accordingly  the company plans to continue to seek attractive acquisition opportunities and to make substantial capital expenditures for manufacturing equipment and facilities to support long term contracts for both commercial and military aircraft and space programs 
ducommun s subsidiary  aerochem  is a major supplier of chemical milling services for the aerospace industry 
aerochem has been directed by california environmental agencies to investigate and take corrective action for groundwater contamination at its el mirage  california facility the site 
aerochem expects to spend approximately million for future investigation and corrective action at the site  and the company has established a provision for such costs 
however  the company s ultimate liability in connection with the site will depend upon a number of factors  including changes in existing laws and regulations  and the design and cost of the construction  operation and maintenance of the corrective action 
in the normal course of business  ducommun and its subsidiaries are defendants in certain other litigation  claims and inquiries  including matters relating to environmental laws 
in addition  the company makes various commitments and incurs contingent liabilities 
while it is not feasible to predict the outcome of these matters  the company does not presently expect that any sum it may be required to pay in connection with these matters would have a material adverse effect on its consolidated financial position or results of operations or cash flows

additional risk factors the company s business  financial condition  results of operations and cash flows may be affected by known and unknown risks  uncertainties and other factors 
any of these risks  uncertainties and other factors could cause the company s future financial results to differ materially from recent financial results or from currently anticipated future financial results 
in addition to those noted elsewhere in this report  the company is subject to the following risks and uncertainties aerospace markets are cyclical the aerospace markets in which the company sells its products are cyclical and have experienced periodic declines 
the market for the company s products sold for new commercial aircraft production is currently experiencing a decline  the depth and duration of which is unknown 
the company s sales are  therefore  unpredictable and tend to fluctuate based on a number of factors  including economic conditions and developments affecting the aerospace industry and the customers served 
for example  the tragic events of september  and the continued downturn in commercial aircraft production have negatively impacted the company s operations 
if the current economic downturn were to continue for an extended period or if conditions in the commercial aircraft market were to worsen  the negative impact on the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be further exacerbated 
commercial aircraft production rates are declining the company estimates that  in  approximately of its sales were for boeing commercial aircraft and approximately of its sales were for other commercial aircraft and miscellaneous nonaerospace commercial applications 
the production rate for new commercial aircraft is expected to decline at least through  and the timing of any rebound in new commercial aircraft production is unknown 
these reductions in commercial aircraft production are expected to affect adversely the company s result of operations and cash flows 
military and space related products are dependent upon government spending the company estimates that  in  approximately of its sales were derived from military and space markets 
these military and space markets are largely dependent upon government spending  particularly by the united states government 
changes in the levels of spending for military and space could improve or reduce the company s prospects in its military and space markets 
the recent tragedy involving the space shuttle columbia may further affect government spending for space programs  which could adversely affect the company 
the company is dependent on boeing commercial aircraft  the c aircraft and apache helicopter programs the company estimates that  in  approximately of its sales were for boeing commercial aircraft  of its sales were for the c aircraft  and of its sales were for the apache helicopter 
the company s sales for boeing commercial aircraft and the c aircraft are principally for new aircraft production  and the company s sales for the apache helicopter program are principally for replacement rotor blades 
any significant change in production rates for these programs would have a material effect on the company s results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  there is no guarantee that the company s current significant customers will continue to buy products from the company at current levels 
the loss of a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the company 
for example  the company manufactures the spoilers for the boeing ng aircraft the spoilers  which contributed approximately  to sales in the company has been informed that a competitor has been awarded a contract to produce the spoilers  although the timing and amount of any transition of work to the competitor is presently unknown 
terrorist attacks  such as those that occurred on september   have adversely impacted the company s operations and may do so again in the future the terrorist attacks that occurred on september  have had a negative impact on commercial air travel and  consequently  on the manufacture of commercial aircraft and the demand for the company s commercial aircraft products 
there can be no assurance that the current world political and military tensions  or the united states military actions  will not lead to further acts of terrorism and civil disturbances in the united states or elsewhere 
these attacks may strike directly at the physical facilities of the company  its suppliers or its customers 
such attacks could have an adverse impact on the company s domestic and international sales  supply chain  production capabilities  insurance premiums or ability to purchase insurance  thereby adversely affecting the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
in addition  the consequences of terrorist attacks and armed conflicts are unpredictable  and their long term effects upon the company are uncertain 
the company is experiencing competitive pricing pressures the aerospace industry is highly competitive and competitive pressures may adversely affect the company 
the company competes worldwide with a number of united states and international companies that are larger than it in terms of resources and market share 
the company is experiencing competitive pricing pressures  particularly in its ducommun aerostructures business 
these competitive pricing pressures have had  and are expected to continue to have  a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
for example  ducommun aerostructures has agreed with several customers to reduce its prices by between and during from the prices in effect at december  although the exact amounts of the price reductions vary by contract  the price reductions cover contracts under which the company had aggregate sales of  in the company faces risks of cost overruns and losses on fixed price contracts the company sells its products under firm  fixed price contracts providing for a fixed price for the products regardless of the production costs incurred by the company 
as a result  manufacturing inefficiencies  start up costs and other factors may result in cost overruns and losses on contracts 
the cost of producing products also may be adversely affected by increases in the cost of labor  materials  outside processing  overhead and other factors 
in many cases  the company makes multiyear firm  fixed price commitments to its customers  without assurance that the company s anticipated production costs will be achieved 
the company s products and processes are subject to risks from changes in technology the company s products and processes are subject to risks of obsolescence as a result of changes in technology 
to address this risk  the company invests in product design and development  and for capital expenditures 
there can be no guarantee that the company s product design and development efforts will be successful  or that the amounts of money required to be invested for product design and development and capital expenditures will not increase materially in the future 
the company faces risks associated with acquisitions and dispositions of businesses a key element of the company s long term strategy has been growth through acquisitions 
the company is continuously reviewing and actively pursuing acquisitions  including acquisitions outside of its current aerospace markets 
acquisitions may require the company to incur additional indebtedness  resulting in increased leverage  or to issue additional equity  resulting in dilution to existing stockholders 
this additional financing for acquisitions and capital expenditures may not be available on terms acceptable or favorable to the company 
acquired businesses may not achieve anticipated results  and could result in a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows 
the company also periodically reviews its existing businesses to determine if they are consistent with the company s strategy 
the company has sold  and may sell in the future  business units and product lines  which may result in either a gain or loss on disposition 
the company s acquisition strategy exposes it to risks  including the risk that the company may not be able to successfully integrate acquired businesses 
the company s ability to grow by acquisition is dependent upon  among other factors  the availability of suitable acquisition candidates
