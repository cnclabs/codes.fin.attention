item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 

table of contents factors that may affect future stock performance the performance of our common stock is dependent upon several factors including those set forth below and in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
control by majority shareholders  ability to issue preferred stock mr 
david a 
schuff  our chairman and co founder  and mr 
scott a 
schuff  our president  chief executive officer  co founder and a member of our board of directors  collectively control the voting of approximately of our outstanding common stock 
as a result  these individuals control the vote on all matters requiring approval of the stockholders  including causing or restricting our sale or merger 
in addition  our certificate of incorporation authorizes us to issue shares of blank check preferred stock  the designation  number  voting powers  preferences  and rights of which may be fixed or altered from time to time by the board of directors 
accordingly  the board of directors has the authority  without stockholder approval  to issue preferred stock with rights that could adversely affect the voting power or other rights of the holders of the common stock 
volatility of stock price the stock market has experienced price and volume fluctuations that have affected the market for many companies and have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
the market price of the common stock is also subject to significant fluctuations in response to variations in our quarterly operating results  analyst reports  announcements concerning our business  legislative or regulatory changes or the interpretation of existing statutes or regulations affecting our business  litigation  general trends in the industry and other events or factors 
in july  we completed an initial public offering of our common stock for per share 
since that time  our common stock has traded as low as per share and as high as per share 
the market price for our common stock remains volatile and there is no assurance that the market price will not experience significant changes in the future 
shares eligible for future sale there were  shares of common stock outstanding as of march  of these shares   shares of common stock are freely tradable 
the  remaining shares of common stock are beneficially held by messrs 
david a 
schuff and scott a 
schuff and are restricted securities as that term is defined under rule promulgated under the securities act of the securities act 
in general  under rule as currently in effect  subject to the satisfaction of certain other conditions  if one year has elapsed since the later of the date of acquisition of restricted shares from either an issuer or an affiliate of an issuer  the acquirer or subsequent holder is entitled to sell in the open market  within any three month period  a number of shares that does not exceed the greater of one percent of the outstanding shares of the same class or the average weekly trading volume during the four calendar weeks preceding the filing of the required notice of sale 
all of the outstanding restricted securities have been held for the one year holding period required under rule no predictions can be made with respect to the effect  if any  that sales of common stock in the market or the availability of shares of common stock for sale under rule will have on the market price of common stock prevailing from time to time 
sales of substantial amounts of common stock in the open market could adversely affect the prevailing market price of the common stock and may make it more difficult for us to sell our equity securities in the future on terms we deem appropriate

financial information relating to addison  quincy  six and bannister has been included subsequent to the respective acquisition dates 
backlog is the amount of potential future revenues to be recognized upon performance of contracts  letters of intent  notices to proceed and purchase orders awarded to us 
backlog increases as new contract commitments  letters of intent  notices to proceed and purchase orders are received  decreases as revenues are recognized  and increases or decreases to reflect modifications in the work to be performed under a contract or potential contract 
of our million backlog as of december   approximately million was attributable to the arizona cardinals multipurpose facility 
restricted funds on deposit represent funds on deposit in interest bearing escrow accounts 
in and  they were maintained in lieu of retention for specific contracts 
retentions on contract receivables are amounts due which are withheld until the completed project has been accepted by the customer in accordance with the contract 
in  they were maintained as security for million of the letters of credit outstanding for the benefit of our workers compensation insurance provider 
we recognize revenues and costs from construction projects using the percentage of completion accounting method 
under this method  revenues are recognized based upon either the ratio of the costs incurred to date to the total estimated costs to complete the project or the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to the total estimated labor hours  commencing when work begins 
construction contracts with customers generally provide that billings are to be made monthly in amounts which are commensurate with the extent of performance under the contracts 
costs and recognized earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts primarily represent revenues earned under the percentage of completion method which have not been billed 
billings in excess of costs and recognized earnings on uncompleted contracts represent amounts billed on contracts in excess of the revenues allowed to be recognized under the percentage of completion method on those contracts 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis provides information regarding our financial and operating position as of december  and  and our results of operations for the years ended december   and this discussion should be read in conjunction with the preceding selected financial data and our consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
recent developments during  the commercial construction industry experienced a dramatic downturn as a result of macroeconomic conditions and increasing geopolitical uncertainty  especially regarding possible us military 
table of contents action in the middle east 
these factors  as well as extreme pricing pressure from local and regional competitors  resulted in elongated selling cycles and reduced demand for our products and services  especially in leisure and tourism based construction projects 
in addition  to the extent that we experience a decreased demand for our products  we must manage our capacity in an effort to cover our fixed operating costs 
the net results were lower revenues and depressed gross margins across all of our business units and in projects both large and small 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  allowance for doubtful accounts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we have adopted the following critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we perform our services primarily under fixed price contracts and recognize revenues using the percentage of completion accounting method 
under this method  revenues are recognized based upon either the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total cost to complete the project or the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to the total estimated labor hours 
revenue recognition begins when work has commenced 
revenues relating to changes in the scope of a contract are recognized when the work has commenced  we have made an estimate of the amount that will be paid for the change and there is a high degree of probability that the charges will be approved by the customer or general contractor 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which revisions become known 
estimated losses on contracts are recognized in full when it is determined that a loss will be incurred on a contract 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts receivable based on estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
in order to estimate the appropriate level of this allowance  we analyze historical payment patterns  aging of accounts receivable  actual write off history  current economic trends and changes in our customer payment patterns 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market under the first in  first out method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
goodwill impairment we assess the impairment of goodwill on an annual basis as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
when we determine that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable  we measure any impairment based on a projected 
table of contents discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  on january   we ceased to amortize goodwill arising from acquisitions completed prior to july  sfas no 
requires an assessment of goodwill upon adoption and at least annually thereafter  using a two step methodology 
based upon the assessment at adoption  we recorded a transitional impairment loss of million  or per basic and diluted earnings per share  as a cumulative effect of an accounting change at the beginning of the first quarter of we completed our first annual assessment of goodwill as of october  our assessment determined that the fair value exceeded the carrying value of the assets 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we feel that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
at december   our net deferred tax asset was  legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
we do not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
because of the uncertainties related to both the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  management is unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates as necessary 
such revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
overview our results of operations are affected primarily by i the level of commercial and industrial construction in our principal markets  ii our ability to win project contracts  iii the amount and complexity of project changes requested by customers or general contractors  iv our success in utilizing our resources at or near full capacity  and v our ability to complete contracts on a timely and cost effective basis 
the level of commercial and industrial construction activity is related to several factors  including local  regional and national economic conditions  interest rates  availability of financing  and the supply of existing facilities relative to demand 
we believe that there is an ongoing trend in the steel fabrication and erection industry to design and build large  complex projects according to accelerated time schedules 
with many projects  only portions of the detail design drawings are completed when construction begins 
the remaining drawings are completed  with numerous design changes being implemented  throughout the construction process 
these fast track  design as you go projects are well suited to integrated contractors that can i reduce the logistical and coordination problems inherent in the use of multiple subcontractors to complete a large  complex project  and ii more efficiently respond to rapid and multiple design changes while minimizing project delays and cost overruns commonly associated with such changes 
the complexity and size of these projects require subcontractors possessing extended financial and operational capabilities 
individual large projects can have a substantial impact upon our results of operations and cause significant fluctuations in revenues and profits from quarter to quarter 
during and  we instituted new controls regarding the bidding and execution of large  complex projects that we believe help protect us 
table of contents against such significant quarter over quarter financial fluctuations 
these guidelines included modifications to our detailing and estimating procedures that we believe result in more timely visibility regarding the status of these projects as well as procedures to rectify errors or inconsistencies that could cause unrealized change orders 
we obtain contracts through competitive bidding or negotiation  which generally are either fixed price  cost plus or unit cost arrangements 
during  and  most of our revenues were derived from projects performed pursuant to fixed price contracts 
in bidding or negotiating contracts  we must estimate our costs  including projected increases in labor  material  and service costs 
project duration typically lasts from one to months 
we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion accounting method 
under this method  revenues are recognized based upon either the ratio of costs incurred to date to the estimated total cost to complete the project or the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to the total estimated labor hours 
revenue recognition begins when work has commenced 
revenues relating to changes in the scope of a contract are recognized when the work has commenced  we have made an estimate of the amount that will be paid for the change and there is a high degree of probability that the charges will be approved by the customer or general contractor 
the cumulative impact of revisions in total cost estimates during the progress of work is reflected in the period in which revisions become known 
estimated losses on contracts are recognized in full when it is determined that a loss will be incurred on a contract 
cost of revenues consists of the costs of materials  equipment  direct labor  fringe benefits  and indirect costs associated with detailing  project management  fabrication and erection  including rent  depreciation and supervisory labor 
other costs not associated with specific projects are included in general and administrative expenses 
gross profit margins can be positively and negatively affected by large  more complex projects  the percentage of negotiated contracts relative to competitively bid contracts  the number and scope of contract modifications  and improvements in operating efficiencies 
the competitive environment  construction delays  inefficient or underutilization of our resources  availability and cost of materials and labor  the timing and performance of work by other contractors  weather conditions and construction site conditions  can adversely affect gross profit margins 
backlog increases as contract commitments  letters of intent  notices to proceed and purchase orders are obtained  decreases as revenues are recognized  and increases or decreases to reflect modifications in the work to be performed under the contract 
the timing of contract commitments  letters of intent  notices to proceed and purchase orders  the size of projects and other factors beyond our control can cause significant fluctuation in backlog outstanding at any given date

revenues decreased by to million in from million in the decrease in revenues was primarily a result of the aforementioned downturn in the commercial construction industry 
the average revenues for our largest revenue generating projects were million in versus million in this increase was primarily due to the three largest projects in generating revenues from million to million compared with the three largest projects in generating revenues from million to million gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in due primarily to cost overruns on some projects coupled with the decreases in gross profit percentage 
as a percentage of revenues  gross profit decreased to in from in  primarily due to the receipt of a number of lower margin projects in late and into we accepted these projects to sustain our volume and keep our shops at capacity 
during the year ended december   costs associated with the project management department at our commercial southwest segment were charged directly to projects and were therefore included in the cost of revenues 
in order to conform with the presentation  million and million of project management costs for the pacific southwest segment were reclassified from general and administrative expenses to cost of revenues in the years ended december  and  respectively 
costs of the project management departments of our other segments continue to be included in the cost of revenues for all periods presented 
during the year ended december   payroll costs associated with certain departments at our commercial southeast segment were included in general and administrative expenses 
in order to conform with the presentation  million of these payroll costs were reclassified from cost of revenues to general and administrative expense for each of the years ended december  and the payroll costs of

other income decreased to million in from million in income tax benefit and expense 
income tax benefit for was  which represents an effective tax benefit rate of approximately 
income tax expense for was million  which represents an effective tax rate of 
we had a large tax benefit in due to the recognition of approximately  of research and development credits and  of refunds received in related to prior years 
in  the effective tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rates primarily because of state income taxes and the amortization of goodwill  which was not deductible for tax purposes 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  this standard eliminates goodwill amortization upon adoption and requires an assessment for goodwill impairment upon adoption and at least annually thereafter 
as a result of adoption of this standard  we did not amortize goodwill during the year ended december  and incurred a noncash transitional impairment charge of million 
net loss and income 
as a result of the factors discussed above  we had a net loss of million in compared to net income of million in backlog 
backlog decreased by to million at december  compared to million at december  the million decrease in backlog compared to december  was primarily the result of the overall continued slowdown in the commercial construction sector  especially in the market for mega projects 
of the backlog at december   approximately million was attributable to the arizona cardinals multipurpose facility 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased by to million in from million in the decrease in revenues was primarily a result of the aforementioned downturn in the commercial construction industry 
the average revenues for our largest revenue generating projects were million in versus million in this decrease was primarily due to one project in colorado that generated approximately million of revenue in but did not generate comparable revenues in gross profit

table of contents general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenues increased to in from in the increase was primarily a result of decreased revenues during general and administrative expenses include those for contract bids  estimating  sales and marketing  facilities  and support services 
goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization was million for the years ended december  and goodwill amortization represents the amortization of the excess of cost over the fair value of net assets acquired from the addison  quincy  six  and bannister business combinations 
the goodwill was being amortized on a straight line basis over years  however  the amortization of goodwill ceased in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
interest expense 
interest expense was million in compared to million in the decrease in interest expense was primarily attributable to our decreased use of our available lines of credit and the reduction of long term debt during interest expense is primarily attributable to our remaining million senior notes issued in june other income 
other income increased to million in from million in the increase was primarily due to the  gain on the extinguishment of debt  the  gain on the sale of a long term investment  and additional interest income due to greater funds being available for investment in income tax expense 
income tax expense for was million which represents an effective tax rate of approximately compared to million in which represented a effective tax rate on earnings 
the effective tax rate is higher than the federal statutory rates primarily because of state income taxes and the amortization of goodwill  which is not deductible for tax purposes 
the increase in the effective tax rate from to is primarily due to the large impact of the nondeductability of goodwill for tax purposes because of decreased income before taxes in net income 
as a result of the factors discussed above  net income decreased by to million in from million in backlog 
backlog increased by to million at december  compared to million at december  the million increase in backlog compared to december  was primarily the result of the award of one large project under a notice to proceed to our pacific southwest segment 
of the backlog at december   approximately million was attributable to one project in arizona and approximately million was attributable to one project in california 
liquidity and capital resources we attempt to structure the payment arrangements under our contracts to match costs incurred under the project 
to the extent we are able to bill in advance of costs incurred  we generate working capital through billings in excess of costs and recognized earnings on uncompleted contracts 
to the extent we are not able to bill in advance of costs  we rely on our credit facilities to meet our working capital needs 
at december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our line of credit  with approximately million available for borrowings  and working capital of approximately million 
we believe that we have sufficient liquidity through our present resources and the existence of our bank credit facility to meet our near term operating needs 
our short term cash needs are primarily for working capital to support operations including receivables  inventories  and other costs incurred in performing our contracts 
operating activities provided cash flows of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   operating cash flows were greater than net loss due to the addback of the million non cash charge for the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  million increase in accounts payable  and million increase in billings in excess of costs and recognized earnings on uncompleted contracts offset by a million increase in restricted funds on deposit and a million increase in receivables 
for the year ended december   operating cash flows were more than net income primarily due to non cash charges of million related to depreciation and amortization and a million decrease in inventories  offset by a million increase in costs and recognized earnings in excess 
table of contents of billings on uncompleted contracts and a million decrease in billings in excess of costs and estimated earnings on uncompleted contracts 
cash used in investing activities totaled  for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december   including purchases of property and equipment of million in and million in financing activities required million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we renegotiated our bank credit facility in december and voluntarily reduced the facility from million to million 
the credit facility now matures on december   and is available for working capital and general corporate purposes 
the credit facility is secured by a first priority  perfected security interest in all of our assets and our present and future subsidiaries 
the interest rate is prime plus 
at december   there was approximately million of credit available under the credit facility for borrowings  after it was reduced by approximately million of outstanding letters of credit 
we also have an additional million of outstanding letters of credit that are not under the million credit facility 
these letters of credit are secured by cash held in an escrow account  which is classified as restricted funds on deposit on the december  balance sheet 
the credit facility also requires that we maintain a specified ebitdar coverage defined as the sum of earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization and rents divided by the sum of interest  rents  senior note and or treasury stock repurchases and capital expenditures  a minimum tangible net worth and quarterly profitability 
the credit facility also contains other covenants that  among other things  limit our ability to pay cash dividends or make other distributions  repurchase our senior notes  incur additional indebtedness  change our business  merge  consolidate or dispose of material portions of our assets 
the security agreements pursuant to which our assets are pledged prohibit any further pledge of such assets without the written consent of the bank 
on june   we completed a private placement of million in principal amount of our senior notes due senior notes 
net proceeds of the senior notes were used to repay certain indebtedness and to pay the cash portions of the purchase price for our acquisitions of addison  quincy  six and bannister 
the senior notes are redeemable at our option  in whole or in part  beginning in at a premium declining ratably to par by we may redeem up to of the senior notes at a premium with the proceeds of an equity offering  provided that at least of the aggregate amount of the senior notes originally outstanding remain outstanding 
the senior notes contain covenants that  among other things  provide limitations on additional indebtedness  sale of assets  change of control and dividend payments 
the senior notes are fully and unconditionally guaranteed  jointly and severally  on a senior subordinated basis by our current and future  direct and indirect subsidiaries 
during both and  we repurchased million in principal amount of our senior notes at a discount on the open market 
we have other long term debt commitments under various capital lease obligations 
the balance of these capital lease obligations was  at december  with interest at and maturing in the years through see note to the consolidated financial statements appearing elsewhere in this report 
we lease some of our fabrication and office facilities from a partnership in which our principal beneficial stockholders and their family members are the general and limited partners 
we have three leases with the partnership for our principal fabrication and office facilities  the property and equipment acquired in the acquisition of b k steel  and additional office facilities adjacent to our principal office and shop facilities 
each lease has a year term and is subject to increases every five years pursuant to the consumer price index 
our annual rental payments for the three leases were million in during  we amended the leases 
the annual rent was reduced to  from million 
with a day written notice  the partnership may increase the rent to the original amount 
the rent continues to be subject to an increase every five years based on the consumer price index 
all other terms and conditions of the lease remain unchanged 
see item properties 
we estimate that our capital expenditures for will be approximately million 
we believe that our available funds  cash generated by operating activities and funds available under our bank credit facilities will be sufficient to fund these capital expenditures and our working capital needs 
however  we may expand our operations through future acquisitions and may require additional equity or debt financing

this statement eliminates the requirement to classify all gains and losses related to the extinguishment of debt as extraordinary items 
as a result  such gains and losses may only be classified as extraordinary if they are both unusual and infrequent 
sfas no 
also requires that capital leases that are modified so that the resulting lease agreement is classified as an operating lease be accounted for as a sale leaseback transaction

specifically  sfas no 
prohibits companies from utilizing the prospective method of transition  the only method offered under the original sfas no 
 in fiscal years beginning after december  however  the statement permits two additional transition methods for companies that adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation  which include the modified prospective and retroactive restatement methods 
under the prospective method  expense is recognized for all employee awards granted  modified or settled after the beginning of the fiscal year in which the recognition provisions are first applied 
the modified prospective method recognizes stock based employee compensation cost from the beginning of the fiscal year in which the provisions are first applied  as if the fair value method had been used to account for all employee awards granted  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  under the retroactive restatement method  all periods presented are restated to reflect stock based employee compensation cost under the fair value method for all employee awards granted  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results with a prescribed specific tabular format and requiring disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies or its equivalent 
we have adopted the new disclosure requirements for and are evaluating the impact if we were to adopt the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under all three methods

fin will require identification of our participation in variable interest entities vies  which are defined as entities with a level of invested equity that is not sufficient to fund future activities to permit it to operate on a standalone basis 
for entities identified as a vie  fin sets forth a model to evaluate potential consolidation based on an assessment of which party to the vie if any bears a majority of the exposure to its expected losses  or stands to gain from a majority of its expected returns 
this interpretation applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which we obtain an interest after that date 
we must adopt fin in the first interim or annual period beginning after june  for any vies created before february  we are currently assessing the application of fin as it relates to our operations  but have not determined what effect  if any  the implementation of fin will have on our financial position or results of operations 
management believes that we did not have any vies as of december  factors that may affect future results and financial condition our future operating results and financial condition are dependent on a number of factors that we must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
the following potential risks and uncertainties  together with those mentioned elsewhere herein  including in item market for registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters  could adversely affect our future operating results  financial condition  and the market price of our common stock 
substantial leverage and ability to service debt with our senior notes and existing line of credit facility  we are highly leveraged with substantial debt service in addition to operating expenses and planned capital expenditures 
our senior notes permit us to incur additional indebtedness  subject to certain limitations  including additional secured indebtedness under existing credit facilities 
our level of indebtedness will have several important effects on our future operations  including  without limitation  i a substantial portion of our cash flow from operations must be dedicated to the payment of interest and principal on our indebtedness  reducing the funds available 
table of contents for operations and for capital expenditures  including acquisitions  ii covenants contained in the senior notes or the credit facility or other credit facilities will require us to meet certain financial tests  and other restrictions will limit our ability to borrow additional funds or to dispose of assets  and may affect our flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in our business  including possible acquisition activities  iii our leveraged position will substantially increase our vulnerability to adverse changes in general economic  industry and competitive conditions  iv our ability to obtain additional financing for working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  general corporate and other purposes may be limited and v our leveraged position and the various covenants contained in the senior notes and the credit facility may place us at a relative competitive disadvantage as compared to certain of our competitors 
our ability to meet our debt service obligations and to reduce our total indebtedness will be dependent upon our future performance  which will be subject to general economic  industry and competitive conditions and to financial  business and other factors affecting our operations  many of which are beyond our control 
there can be no assurance that our business will continue to generate cash flow at or above current levels 
if we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations in the future to service our debt  we may be required  among other things  to seek additional financing in the debt or equity markets  to refinance or restructure all or a portion of our indebtedness  including the senior notes  to sell selected assets  or to reduce or delay planned capital expenditures and growth or business strategies 
there can be no assurance that any such measures would be sufficient to enable us to service our debt  or that any of these measures could be effected on satisfactory terms  if at all 
dependence on construction industry we earn virtually all of our revenues in the building construction industry  which is subject to local  regional and national economic cycles 
our revenues and cash flows depend to a significant degree on major construction projects in various industries  including the hotel and casino  retail shopping  health care  mining  computer chip manufacturing  public works and other industries  each of which industries may be adversely affected by general or specific economic conditions 
if construction activity declines significantly in our principal markets  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent developments 
fluctuating quarterly results of operations we have experienced  and in the future are expected to continue to experience  substantial variations in our results of operations from quarter to quarter as a result of a number of factors  many of which are outside our control 
in particular  our operating results may vary because of downturns in one or more segments of the building construction industry  changes in economic conditions  our failure to obtain  or delays in awards of  major projects  the cancellation of major projects  or our failure to timely replace projects that have been completed or are nearing completion 
in addition  from time to time we have disputes with our customers concerning change orders to our contracts 
to the extent such disputes are not resolved on a timely basis  our results of operations may be affected 
any of the foregoing factors could result in the periodic inefficient or underutilization of our resources and could cause our operating results to fluctuate significantly from period to period  including on a quarterly basis 
revenue recognition estimates we recognize revenues using the percentage of completion accounting method 
under this method  revenues are recognized based on either the ratio that costs incurred to date bear to the total estimated costs to complete the project or the ratio of labor hours incurred to date to the total estimated labor hours 
estimated losses on contracts are recognized in full when we determine that a loss will be incurred 
we frequently review and revise revenues and total cost estimates as work progresses on a contract and as contracts are modified 
accordingly  revenue adjustments based upon the revised completion percentage are reflected in the period that estimates are revised 
although revenue estimates are based upon management assumptions supported by historical experience  these estimates could vary materially from actual results 
to the extent percentage of 
table of contents completion adjustments reduce previously reported revenues  we would recognize a charge against operating results  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations for the applicable period 
variations in backlog  dependence on large contracts our backlog can be significantly affected by the receipt  or loss  of individual contracts 
for example  approximately million  representing of our backlog at december   was attributable to five contracts  letters of intent  notices to proceed or purchase orders 
if one or more large contracts are terminated or their scope reduced  our backlog could decrease substantially 
our future business and results of operations may be adversely affected if we are unable to replace significant contracts when lost or completed  or if we otherwise fail to maintain a sufficient level of backlog 
in addition  if a project representing a significant portion of our backlog is delayed or otherwise postponed  our anticipated revenue from that project may not be realized until later than anticipated 
in particular  political and site selection considerations have caused a delay in the start of construction of the arizona cardinals multipurpose facility  which currently accounts for million of our current backlog 
to the extent that any further political or other considerations delay this project  the recognition of revenue we anticipate from this project will also be delayed 
see management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and business backlog 
fixed price contracts most of our million backlog at december  represented projects being performed on a fixed price basis 
in bidding on projects  we estimate our costs  including projected increases in costs of labor  material and services 
despite these estimates  costs and gross profit realized on a fixed price contract may vary from estimated amounts because of unforeseen conditions or changes in job conditions  variations in labor and equipment productivity over the terms of contracts  higher than expected increases in labor or material costs and other factors 
these variations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of our operations for any period 
geographic concentration our fabrication and erection operations currently are conducted primarily in arizona  nevada  florida  georgia  california and texas 
because of this concentration  future construction activity and our business may be adversely affected in the event of a downturn in economic conditions existing in these states and in the southwestern and southeastern united states generally 
factors that may affect economic conditions include increases in interest rates or limitations in the availability of financing for construction projects  decreases in the amount of funds budgeted for governmental projects  decreases in capital expenditures devoted to the construction of plants  distribution centers  retail shopping centers  industrial facilities  hotels and casinos  convention centers and other facilities  the prevailing market prices of copper  gold and other metals that impact related mining activity  and downturns in occupancy rates  office space demand  tourism and convention related activity and population growth 
competition many small and various large companies offer fabrication  erection and related services that compete with those we provide 
local and regional companies offer competition in one or more of our geographic markets or product segments 
out of state or international companies may provide competition in any market 
we compete for every project we obtain 
although we believe customers consider  among other things  the availability and technical capabilities of equipment and personnel  efficiency  safety record and reputation  price competition usually is the primary factor in determining which qualified contractor is awarded a contract 
competition has resulted in pressure on pricing and operating margins  and the effects of competitive pressure in the industry may continue 
some of our competitors have greater capital and other resources than ours and are more established in their respective markets 
there can be no assurance that our competitors will not substantially increase their commitment of resources devoted to competing aggressively with us or that we will be able to compete profitably with our competitors 

table of contents substantial liquidity requirements our operations require significant amounts of working capital to procure materials for contracts to be performed over relatively long periods  and for purchases and modifications of heavy duty and specialized fabrication equipment 
in addition  our contract arrangements with customers sometimes require us to provide payment and performance bonds and  in selected cases  letters of credit  to partially secure our obligations under our contracts  which may require us to incur significant expenditures prior to receipt of payments 
furthermore  our customers often will retain a portion of amounts otherwise payable to us during the course of a project as a guarantee of completion of that project 
to the extent the we are unable to receive project payments in the early stages of a project  our cash flow would be reduced  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
capacity constraints  dependence on subcontractors we routinely rely on subcontractors to perform a significant portion of our fabrication  erection and project detailing to fulfill projects that we cannot fulfill in house due to capacity constraints or that are in markets in which we have not established a strong local presence 
with respect to these projects  our success depends on our ability to retain and successfully manage these subcontractors 
any difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified subcontractors on terms and conditions favorable to us could have an adverse effect on our ability to complete these projects in a timely and cost effective manner 
dependence upon key personnel our success depends on the continued services of our senior management and key employees as well as our ability to attract additional members to our management team with experience in the steel fabrication and erection industry 
the unexpected loss of the services of any of our management or other key personnel  or our inability to attract new management when necessary  could have a material adverse effect upon our operations 
union contracts we currently are a party to a number of collective bargaining agreements with various unions representing some of our fabrication and erection employees 
these contracts expire or are subject to expiration at various times in the future 
our inability to renew such contracts could result in work stoppages and other labor disturbances  which could disrupt our business and adversely affect our results of operations 
no assurance of successful acquisitions in addition to acquisitions we made in of addison  quincy  six and bannister  we intend to consider acquisitions of and alliances with other companies in our industry that could complement our business  including the acquisition of entities in diverse geographic regions and entities offering greater access to industries and markets not currently served by us 
there can be no assurance that suitable acquisition or alliance candidates can be identified or  if identified  that we will be able to consummate such transactions 
further  there can be no assurance that we will be able to integrate successfully any acquired companies into our existing operations  which could increase our operating expenses 
moreover  any acquisition by us may result in potentially dilutive issuances of equity securities  incurrence of additional debt and amortization of expenses related to intangible assets  all of which could adversely affect our profitability 
acquisitions involve numerous risks  such as diverting attention of our management from other business concerns  our entrance into markets in which we have had no or only limited experience and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the acquisitions of addison  quincy  six  and bannister have consumed and will continue to consume substantial management attention and resources and will require substantial efforts and entail certain risks in the integration of their operations 
there can be no assurance that anticipated cost savings or synergies will be achieved 
we will be dependent on the retention and future performance of key officers and employees of addison  quincy  six  and bannister for day to day management and future operating results 

table of contents operating risks  litigation construction and heavy steel plate weldments involve a high degree of operational risk 
natural disasters  adverse weather conditions  design  fabrication and erection errors and work environment accidents can cause death or personal injury  property damage and suspension of operations 
the occurrence of any of these events could result in loss of revenues  increased costs  and liability to third parties 
we are subject to litigation claims in the ordinary course of business  including lawsuits asserting substantial claims 
currently  we do not maintain any reserves for our ongoing litigation 
we periodically review the need to maintain a litigation reserve 
we maintain risk management  insurance  and safety programs intended to prevent or mitigate losses 
there can be no assurance that any of these programs will be adequate or that we will be able to maintain adequate insurance in the future at rates that we consider reasonable 
potential environmental liability our operations and properties are affected by numerous federal  state and local environmental protection laws and regulations  such as those governing discharges to air and water and the handling and disposal of solid and hazardous wastes 
compliance with these laws and regulations has become increasingly stringent  complex and costly 
there can be no assurance that such laws and regulations or their interpretation will not change in a manner that could materially and adversely affect our operations 
certain environmental laws  such as the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act cercla and its state law counterparts  provide for strict and joint and several liability for investigation and remediation of spills and other releases of toxic and hazardous substances 
these laws may apply to conditions at properties currently or formerly owned or operated by an entity or its predecessors  as well as to conditions at properties at which wastes or other contamination attributable to an entity or its predecessors come to be located 
although we have not incurred any material environmental related liability in the past and we believe that we are in material compliance with environmental laws  there can be no assurance that we  or entities for which we may be responsible  will not incur such liability in connection with the investigation and remediation of facilities we currently operate or formerly owned or operated or other locations in a manner that could materially and adversely affect our operations 
governmental regulation many aspects of our operations are subject to governmental regulations in the united states and in other countries in which we operate  including regulations relating to occupational health and workplace safety  principally the occupational safety and health act and regulations thereunder 
in addition  we are subject to licensure and hold or have applied for licenses in each of the states in the united states in which we operate and in certain local jurisdictions within such states 
although we believe that we are in material compliance with applicable laws and permitting requirements  there can be no assurance that we will be able to maintain this status 
further  we cannot determine to what extent future operations and earnings may be affected by new legislation  new regulations or changes in or new interpretations of existing regulations

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instrument during and  we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments  or other financial or derivative commodity instruments 
primary market risk exposure we are potentially exposed to market risk associated with changes in interest rates primarily as a result of our initial million fixed rate senior notes  which were issued on june  specifically  we are exposed to changes in the fair value of the remaining million senior notes 
at december   the fair value of the senior notes was approximately of par or million 
from january  to december   the senior notes had a fair value that was as low as of par and as high as of par 
the variation in fair value is a function of market interest rate changes and the investor perception of the investment quality of the senior notes
