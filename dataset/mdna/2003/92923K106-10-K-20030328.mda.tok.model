item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the purpose of the following discussion is to address information relating to the financial condition and results of operations of the company that may not be readily apparent from a review of the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto  which begin on page f of this report 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with information provided in the company s consolidated financial statements and accompanying footnotes 
earnings overview for the years ended december   and the company reported net earnings of million in  million in and million in  representing an increase of between fiscal years and and an increase of between fiscal years and the increases over the three fiscal years are primarily attributable to the bank s continued loan growth  higher non interest income and lower increases in non interest expense 
net earnings per share on a fully diluted basis was for  for and for  representing an increase of between fiscal years and and between fiscal years and the net earnings per share for was affected by the previously described common stock offering completed in april which increased the number of shares outstanding 
return on average assets and return on average shareholders equity for was and  respectively  compared with and  respectively  for  and and  respectively  for the reduction of return on average equity was primarily due to a large increase in equity in the increase was comprised of the common stock offering million  an increase in retained earnings million and an increase in other comprehensive income thousand 
these items had the effect of increasing the average balance of shareholders equity by million over net interest income the company s operational results primarily depend on the earnings of the bank 
the bank s earnings depend  to a large degree  on net interest income 
net interest income is defined as the difference between the interest income received from its investments such as loans  investment securities  federal funds sold  etc 
and the interest expense on deposits and other borrowings 
the following discussion and analysis of net interest margin assumes and is stated on a tax equivalent basis 
that is  non taxable interest is restated at its taxable equivalent rate 
the banking industry uses two key ratios to measure the relative profitability of net interest income 
the net interest rate spread measures the difference between the average yield on interest earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the interest rate spread eliminates the impact of non interest bearing deposits and gives a direct perspective on the effect of market interest rate movements 
the other commonly used measure is net interest margin 
the net interest margin is defined as net interest income as a percent of average total interest earning assets and takes into account the positive impact of investing non interest bearing deposits 
net interest income increased by million in from  and by thousand or in from net interest income at december   was million compared to million in and million in the net interest margin on interest earning assets was in  in and in beginning in early through the end of  short term interest rates have dropped basis points 
comparing the interest margin in to that in  the bank s interest margin has declined by basis points 
measuring from its three year high in  the bank s interest margin has decreased basis points 
the bank entered into an interest rate swap in december that benefited its interest margin for during  the bank recorded a net benefit which reduced interest expense by thousand 
in addition  management s interest rate risk strategies helped to mitigate the effects of rapidly declining interest rates 
during  the bank s cost of funds was reduced by basis points while the yield on earning assets declined basis points resulting in the net interest spread widening in by basis points 
the asset repricing point has caught up with the immediate repricing of the interest bearing transaction account liabilities 
the decrease in the net interest margin between and is primarily due to the rapid decline in the prime and discount rates during as assets repriced more quickly than funding sources 
those benchmark rates declined basis points in ten months 
the bank s balance sheet has traditionally been slightly liability sensitive 

table of contents that is  its liabilities re price faster than its assets because of its high percentage of transaction accounts 
therefore  in a rising rate environment the bank s interest margin tends to narrow whereas in a falling rate environment the bank s interest margin tends to widen 
however  when rates fall rapidly and drastically  the bank s cost of funds hit an economic floor 
for instance  if the bank was paying on a now checking account  on a savings account and on a money market account and market rates decrease basis points  the now  savings and money market rate can only fall a fraction of that amount due to competitive issues 
additionally  time deposits which have a fixed maturity are unable to decline as quickly as transaction accounts 
the net result is that the bank s interest margin narrows since the yield on earning assets has further to fall than the cost of funds 
the bank s management  through its asset liability management process  attempts to manage its interest sensitivity position 
however  no balance sheet management technique can completely shield the bank s margin from the precipitous interest rate movement experienced in and the cost of interest bearing liabilities was for  for and for  representing a decrease of basis points between fiscal and and an decrease of basis points between fiscal and if one considers the yield on interest bearing assets of for  for and for  the impact of decreasing rates on asset yields was more pronounced in than in  but the cost of funds decline in the same period was greater 
yields between and decreased basis points as opposed to an increase of basis points between and comparing net interest margins of for  for and  one can clearly identify the impact on net interest margin as rates declined basis points over the last ten months of and another basis points in prolonged low rates will have the impact of lowering the company s net interest margin 
the following table shows  for the past three years  the relationship between interest income and interest expense and the average daily balances of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities on a tax equivalent basis assuming a rate of

tax exempt interest income is calculated on a tax equivalent basis 
the following table shows the relative impact on net interest income of changes in the annual average daily outstanding balances volume of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities and the rates earned rate by the bank on such assets and liabilities 
variances resulting from a combination of changes in rate and volume are allocated in proportion to the absolute dollar amounts of the change in each category

service charges on deposit accounts have increased an average of over the last two years and most of that increase is due to insufficient funds charges and service charges on increased new account activity 
mortgage origination fees have increased from to and from to this is primarily due to continued low mortgage rates in and and customers desiring to either refinance their existing homes or purchase new homes 
the bank settled its interest rate swap position accounted for as a fair value hedge in august  recognizing a gain of  which is included in miscellaneous income for this income is non recurring in nature as the bank has no other hedge positions currently in place 
other expenses increased by million  or  in over the increase was due to an increase in salaries and employee benefits of thousand  or  an increase in occupancy expense of thousand  or  and an increase in other operating expense of thousand  or 
the increase in salary and employee benefits is attributable to the following factors i increased number of full time equivalent employees  ii a full year of wages for the staff at the douglasville branch opened in mid  iii increased commissions to mortgage loan originators due to the increase of mortgage origination activity  iv increased costs of health insurance  and v annual raises and increased profit sharing bonuses due to higher profitability 
the company had more full time equivalent employees at the end of than it did at the end of the increase in occupancy expense in as compared to was primarily attributable to a full year of operations in our douglasville branch in addition to increased depreciation expense due to additional office space and investment in bank technology 
the increase in other operating expense is due to increases in legal  accounting  and annual fees associated with compliance with sec regulations and listing requirements for nasdaq 
additionally  the bank paid increased software fees associated with its bounce protection program which is commensurate with the increased fee income 
other notable increases in expenses from to are related to occupancy and other operating expenses increasing thousand  or 
this increase was due to increased occupancy and operating costs associated with the mirror lake and douglasville offices and to increased costs associated with the bounce protection program 

table of contents income taxes  expressed as a percentage of earnings before income taxes  declined to in  from in and in the decline in marginal tax rate over the past three years is primarily attributable to tax credits purchased by the bank in having a full effect in in addition  in october the bank formed wgnb investments  inc  a nevada corporation  to manage  hold and trade cash  securities and loans of the bank which had the effect of reducing its state income tax liability slightly in balance sheet overview for the years ended december  and general during  average total assets increased million  average deposits increased million and average loans increased million from those recorded in during  average total assets increased million  average deposits increased million and average loans increased million from those recorded in the bank s growth rate in slowed significantly when compared to and this was attributable to the slowdown of the economy and business expansion in the bank s market area 
management endeavors to let loan growth drive balance sheet growth and  thus  a slowdown in loan growth is reflected on the balance sheet 
total assets at december   were million  representing a million increase from december  total deposits increased million from to while total loans increased million during the increase in deposits in is attributable to an increase in non interest bearing demand accounts of million  an increase in interest bearing demand accounts of million and a decrease in time deposit accounts of million 
demand accounts accounted for the vast majority of deposit increases in we attribute the demand deposit growth to three events that occurred in first  the only three independent competing community banks that remained in carroll county merged with regional banks 
this displacement has led to new checking account customers for the bank 
second  because the time deposit rates are so low  some customers have moved their funds to money market accounts and now accounts in hopes that longer term cd rates will increase in the immediate future 
third  the bank has deposit relationships with numerous county and municipal authorities 
these deposit relationships in the banking industry are known as public funds 
at the end of  certain public entities had collected tax revenue in the amount of million  subsequently deposited with the bank  causing the bank s liquidity to increase 
this amount was on deposit with the bank at year end  but typically is disbursed in the first quarter of the following year 
as the local and regional economy softened  loan demand fell off in the last half of and that trend continued throughout the bank had grown its loan portfolio by million in  by million in and by million in the loans were funded principally with increased demand deposit accounts  a lower cost funding source and fhlb borrowings  typically lower than comparable certificates of deposit rates and terms 
the bank experienced approximately million in loan payoffs in the fourth quarter of which had a detrimental effect on loan growth for and is also a factor underlying the spike in the bank s liquidity at year end 
total assets at december   were million  representing a million increase from december  total deposits increased million from to while total loans increased million during a little less than half of the increase in deposits came as a result of an increase of million in interest bearing demand accounts from to while time deposits accounts increased million in by june   the bank had grown million in loans however the actual growth for the year was million 
deposit growth  on the other hand  remained strong throughout as customers sought to move funds from the stock market back to the bank as a flight to safety 
approximately fifty percent of the loan growth experienced by the company was funded with fhlb advances 
the remainder was funded principally with increases in deposit accounts 

table of contents investments the company s available for sale investment portfolio of million as of december  consisted primarily of debt securities  which provide the company with a source of liquidity and a stable source of income 
this represented a decrease of million over the million held at december  the company believes the investment portfolio provides a balance to interest rate and credit risk in other categories of the balance sheet while providing a vehicle for the investment of available funds and supplying securities to pledge as required collateral for certain public deposits 
investment securities available for sale are stated at fair value 
these securities may be sold  retained until maturity  or pledged as collateral for liquidity and borrowing in response to changing interest rates  changes in prepayment risk and other factors as part of the company s overall asset liability management strategy 
investment securities held to maturity are stated at amortized cost and totaled million at december   an increase of million when compared to the prior year 
the increase is attributable to the purchase of banking industry issued trust preferred securities from various issuers across the united states and the southeast 
the company has the intent and ability to hold these securities until maturity

table of contents loans loan concentrations are defined as aggregate credits extended to a number of borrowers engaged in similar activities or resident in the same geographic region  which would cause them to be similarly affected by economic or other conditions 
the bank  on a routine basis  evaluates these concentrations for purposes of policing its concentrations and making necessary adjustments in its lending practices to reflect current economic conditions  loan to deposit ratios  and industry trends 
the primary types of loans in the bank s portfolio are residential mortgages and home equity loans  commercial real estate loans  commercial loans  and consumer installment loans 
generally  the bank underwrites loans based upon the borrower s debt service capacity or cash flow  a consideration of past performance on loans from other creditors as well as an evaluation of the collateral securing the loan 
with some exceptions  the bank s general policy is to require conservative underwriting policies  primarily in the analysis of borrowers debt service coverage capabilities for commercial and commercial real estate loans  while emphasizing lower gross debt ratios for consumer loans and lower loan to value ratios for all types of real estate loans 
given the localized nature of the bank s lending activities  the primary risk factor affecting the portfolio as a whole is the health of the local economy in the west georgia area and its effects on the value of local real estate and the incomes of local professionals and business firms 
loans to directors  executive officers and principal shareholders of the company and to directors and officers of the bank are subject to limitations of the federal reserve  the principal effect of which is to require that extensions of credit by the bank to executive officers  directors  and ten percent shareholders satisfy certain standards 
the bank routinely makes loans in the ordinary course of business to certain directors and executive officers of the company and the bank  their associates  and members of their immediate families 
in accordance with federal reserve guidelines  these loans are made on substantially the same terms  including interest rates and collateral  as those prevailing for comparable transactions with others and do not involve more than normal risk of collectibility or present other unfavorable features 
as of december   loans and commitments outstanding to directors and executive officers of the company and the bank  their associates and members of their immediate families totaled million net of participations sold to other banks on a non recourse basis  which represented approximately of total loans as of that date 
as of december   none of these loans outstanding from the bank to related parties were on non accrual  past due  restructured or considered by management to be a potential problem loan

the allowance for loan losses represented  and of total loans outstanding at december   and  respectively 
total charge offs were thousand  thousand and thousand compared to recoveries of thousand  thousand and thousand during  and  respectively 
the company has an independent loan review function 
all loans are placed in loan grade categories  which are consistent with those used by the bank s regulators 
all loans are constantly monitored by the loan officer and the loan review function for credit quality  consistency and accuracy 
through this grading process  the bank assures the timely recognition of credit risks 
in general  as credit risk increases  the level of the allowance for loan loss will also increase 
a formal allowance for loan loss adequacy test is performed at each month end 
specific amounts of loss are estimated on problem loans and historical loss percentages are applied to the balance of the portfolio using certain portfolio stratifications 
additionally  the evaluation takes into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions  regulatory examination results  and the existence of loan concentrations 
management s judgment in determining the adequacy of the allowance is based on evaluations of the collectability of loans 
these evaluations take into consideration such factors as changes in the nature and volume of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions that may affect the borrower s ability to pay  overall portfolio quality  and review of specific problem loans 
in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses  management uses a loan grading system that rates loans in eight different categories 
grades five though eight  which represent criticized or classified loans  are assigned allocations of loss based on management s estimate of potential loss that is generally based on historical losses and or collateral deficiencies 
loans graded one through four are stratified by type and allocated loss ranges based on historical loss experience for the strata 
the 
table of contents combination of these results are compared monthly to the recorded allowance for loan losses and material differences are adjusted by increasing or decreasing the provision for loan losses 
loans deemed to be impaired are evaluated individually to measure the probable loss  if any  in the credit 
management uses an internal loan reviewer who is independent of the lending function to challenge and corroborate the loan grading system and provide additional analysis in determining the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses and the future provisions for estimated loan losses 
management believes that the allowance for loan losses is adequate 
while management uses available information to recognize losses on loans  future additions to the allowance may be necessary based on changes in economic conditions and a change in the borrowers ability to repay 
in addition  regulators  as an integral part of their examination process  periodically review the company s allowance for loan losses 
such regulators may require the company to recognize additions to the allowance based on their judgments of information available to them at the time of their examination 
management of the company realizes the importance of maintaining an adequate allowance for loan losses 
through a professional loan review function and effective loan officer identification program  management is recognizing weaknesses in the loan portfolio in a timely manner 
early identification of deteriorating credit attributes allows management to take a proactive role in documenting an established plan to enhance the company s position and minimize the potential for loss 
through the problem loan identification program outlined above  management is able to identify those loans that exhibit weakness and classify them on a classified and criticized loan list 
the company s migration analysis assigns historical loss amounts to pools of loans according to classifications of risk ratings to calculate a general allowance to the overall portfolio 
in cases where significant weaknesses exist in a specific loan  a specific reserve is assigned to such loans in addition to the general allowance 
the company also evaluates the risks associated with concentrations in credit 
if it is necessary to assign an allowance related to concentrations of credit  the company adds a specific reserve related to such risks

the percentage of non performing assets to total loans has decreased from its peak in the decrease of non performing loans from to was attributable to loans on non accrual paying off or coming off non accrual status in the amount of thousand and a reduction of loans ninety days past due in the amount of thousand

as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans are classified as non accrual generally when they are past due in principal or interest payments for more than days or it is otherwise not reasonable to expect collection of principal and interest under the original terms 
exceptions are allowed for day past due loans when such loans are well secured and in process of collection 
generally  payments received on non accrual loans are applied directly to principal 
the bank s loan review function continually monitors selected accruing loans for which general economic conditions or changes within a particular industry that could cause the borrowers financial difficulties 
the loan review function also identifies loans with high degrees of credit or other risks 
the focus of loan review and management is to maintain a low level of non performing assets and return current non performing assets to earning status 
management is unaware of any known trends  events or uncertainties that will have or that are reasonably likely to have a material effect on the company s liquidity  capital resources or operations

to meet these obligations  the bank keeps cash on hand  maintains account balances with its correspondent banks  and purchases and sells federal funds and other short term 
table of contents investments 
asset and liability maturities are monitored in an attempt to match these to meet liquidity needs 
it is the policy of the bank to monitor its liquidity to meet regulatory requirements and their local funding requirements 
management believes that the bank s current level of liquidity is adequate to meet its needs 
the bank maintains relationships with correspondent banks including the federal home loan bank the fhlb that can provide funds to it on short notice  if needed 
the bank has arrangements with correspondent and commercial banks for short term unsecured advances up to million 
as of december   the bank had not drawn on the available facilities 
in addition  the bank has a line of credit with the fhlb in the amount of million of which the bank had drawn million at december  the lines of credit have varying terms and maturities that are disclosed in detail in the notes to the financial statements 
the company s cash flows are composed of three classifications cash flows from operating activities  cash flows from investing activities  and cash flows from financing activities 
cash and cash equivalents increased million for a total million at december   compared with million at december  the increase was primarily attributable to net cash provided by financing activities of million made up of million of increased deposits  million of borrowing proceeds and million in offering proceeds offset by other items totaling approximately million 
cash inflows from operations totaled million in  while outflows from investing activities totaled million  most of which was net loan increases during of million 
cash inflows from operations totaled million in  while inflows from financing activities totaled million  most of which was net deposit increases during of million and fhlb advances of million 
investing activities used million of cash and cash equivalents  principally composed of net advances of loans to customers of million and net cash flows invested in securities of million during the bank purchased property and equipment for operations and future expansion amounting to million 
capital resources total shareholders equity as of december  was million  an increase of million over the increase in equity was due to a public offering the company completed in april through the sales efforts of its directors and officers 
the company offered and sold  shares of common stock for per share 
the net proceeds of the offering less offering costs was million 
the offering  combined with million in net income less million in dividends and an increase in unrealized holding gain on securities available for sale of thousand net of tax  accounted for the large increase in shareholders equity 
the occ has established certain minimum risk based capital standards that apply to national banks  and the company is subject to certain capital requirements imposed by the federal reserve 
at december   the bank exceeded all applicable regulatory capital requirements for classification as a well capitalized bank  and the company satisfied all applicable regulatory requirements imposed on it by the federal reserve

average equity to average assets was in and in the ratio of dividends declared to net earnings was during  compared with in off balance sheet risk through the operations of the bank  the company has made contractual commitments to extend credit in the ordinary course of its business activities 
these commitments are legally binding agreements to lend money to the bank s customers at predetermined interest rates for a specified period of time 
at december   the bank had issued commitments to extend credit of  through various types of commercial lending arrangements and additional commitments through standby letters of credit of  the company evaluates each customer s creditworthiness on a case by case basis 
the amount of collateral obtained  if deemed necessary by the company upon extension of credit  is based on its credit evaluation of the borrower 
collateral varies but may include accounts receivable  inventory  property  plant and equipment  commercial and residential real estate 
the company manages the credit risk on these commitments by subjecting them to normal underwriting and risk management processes 
asset liability management it is the company s objective to manage assets and liabilities to provide a satisfactory  consistent level of profitability within the framework of established cash  loan  investment  borrowing and capital policies 
certain officers are charged with the responsibility for monitoring policies and procedures that are designed to ensure acceptable composition of the asset liability mix 
it is the overall philosophy of management to support asset growth primarily through growth of deposits and borrowing strategies  which minimize the company s exposure to interest rate risk 
the objective of the policy is to control interest sensitive assets and liabilities so as to minimize the impact of substantial movements in interest rates on earnings 
the asset liability mix is monitored on a regular basis 
a report reflecting the interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities is prepared and presented to management and the asset liability management committee on at least a quarterly basis 
one method to measure a bank s interest rate exposure is through its repricing gap 
the gap is calculated by taking all assets that reprice or mature within a given time frame and subtracting all liabilities that reprice or mature within that time frame 
the difference between these two amounts is called the gap  the amount of either liabilities or assets that will reprice without a corresponding asset or liability repricing 
a negative gap more liabilities repricing than assets generally indicates that the bank s net interest income will decrease if interest rates rise and will increase if interest rates fall 
a positive gap generally indicates that the bank s net interest income will decrease if rates fall and will increase if rates rise 
the company has adopted the objective of achieving and maintaining a one year cumulative gap  as a percent of total assets  of between plus and minus 
on a consolidated basis  the company s one year cumulative gap 
table of contents was a negative of total assets at december  this position indicated that the company was exposed to the potential for decreased earnings if interest rates were to continue to decline in the next twelve months 
due to inherent limitations in traditional gap analysis  the company also employs more sophisticated modeling techniques to monitor potential changes in net interest income  net income and the market value of portfolio equity under various interest rate scenarios 
market risk is the risk of loss from adverse changes in market prices and rates  arising primarily from interest rate risk in the company s loan and investment portfolios  which can significantly impact the company s profitability 
net interest income can be adversely impacted where assets and liabilities do not react the same to changes in interest rates 
at year end  the estimated impact of an immediate increase in interest rates of basis points would have resulted in a decrease in net interest income over a month period of  with a comparable decrease in interest rates resulting in a decrease in net interest income of 
management finds the above methodologies meaningful for evaluating market risk sensitivity  however  other factors can affect net interest income  such as levels of non earning assets and changes in portfolio composition and volume 
the following table summarizes the amounts of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities outstanding at december  that are expected to mature  prepay or reprice in each of the future time periods shown 
except as stated below  the amount of assets or liabilities that mature or reprice during a particular period was determined in accordance with the contractual terms of the asset or liability 
adjustable rate loans are included in the period in which interest rates are next scheduled to adjust rather than in the period in which they are due  and fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities are included in the periods in which they are anticipated to be repaid based on scheduled maturities  although the cash flows received often differ from scheduled maturities 
the company s savings accounts and interest bearing demand accounts now and money market deposit accounts  which are generally subject to immediate withdrawal  are included in the one year or less category  although historical experience has proven these deposits to be less interest rate sensitive over the course of a year and are subject to management s control

the above chart indicates an excess of liabilities repricing or maturing within one year  thus a rise in interest rates would cause the company s net interest income to decline 
however  certain 
table of contents shortcomings are inherent in the method of analysis presented in the foregoing table 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees or at different points in time to changes in market interest rates 
such is the case in analyzing now accounts  which are disclosed in the one year or less category 
those liabilities do not necessarily reprice as quickly or to the same degree as rates in general 
additionally  certain assets  such as adjustable rate mortgages  have features that restrict changes in interest rates  both on a short term basis and over the life of the asset 
changes in interest rates  prepayment rates  early withdrawal levels and the ability of borrowers to service their debt  among other factors  may change significantly from the assumptions made in the table 
impact of inflation  changing prices and monetary policies the primary effect of inflation on the company s operations is reflected in increased operating costs 
unlike industrial companies  virtually all of the assets and liabilities of a financial institution are monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in interest rates have a more significant effect on the performance of a financial institution than do the effects of changes in the general rate of inflation and changes in prices 
interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the prices of goods and services 
interest rates are highly sensitive to many factors which are beyond the control of the company  including the influence of domestic and foreign economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the united states government and federal agencies  particularly the federal reserve 
the federal reserve implements a national monetary policy such as seeking to curb inflation and combat recession by its open market operations in united states government securities  control of the discount rate applicable to borrowing by banks  and establishment of reserve requirements against bank deposits 
the actions of the federal reserve in these areas influence the growth of bank loans  investments and deposits  and affect the interest rates charged on loans and paid on deposits 
the nature  timing and impact of any future changes in federal monetary and fiscal policies on the company and its results of operations are not predictable
