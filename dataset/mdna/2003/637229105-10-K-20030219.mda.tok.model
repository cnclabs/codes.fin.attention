item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies general the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions  and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as this information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
certain policies inherently have greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions  and judgments and as such have greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
income taxes the company is included in the consolidated federal income tax return of national city 
national city allocates income taxes to the company as if it were a stand alone tax paying entity 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized as certain items are required to be treated differently for financial statement purposes versus how they are treated for tax purposes 
management judgments and estimates are required in determining the income tax provision as well as the balances of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
as of december   the company had net deferred tax assets of million 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that certain amounts will not be realized 
the company considers projected future taxable income and tax planning strategies in assessing the need for a valuation allowance 
should the company determine in the future that all or part of its net deferred tax asset is unrealizable  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
management provides reserves when it is likely that a taxing authority may take a sustainable position on a matter contrary to the company s position 
long lived assets long lived assets  consisting primarily of property and equipment  goodwill and other intangible assets  comprise a significant portion of the company s total assets 
property and equipment  net of accumulated depreciation  totaled million as of december   which represented of total assets 
useful lives of property and equipment which includes internal use software are estimated in order to determine the amount of depreciation expense to be recorded during each reporting period 
the useful lives are estimated at the time the assets are acquired based on historical experience with similar assets and current business plans 
based on future events and changes in business plans  the useful lives assigned to these assets may need to be shortened  resulting in the recognition of increased depreciation expense in future periods 
these changes could also result in the recognition of an immediate impairment charge to reflect the write down in value of the assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
alternatively  assets may ultimately be used by the company for longer than their assigned depreciable lives 
internal use software is a component of property and equipment 
the company capitalizes certain costs incurred to develop or obtain internal use software in accordance with statement of position  accounting for the costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
the company capitalizes costs once the preliminary project stage has been completed  management has approved funding for the project  and it is probable that the project will be completed and that the software will be used for its intended use 
capitalized software development and purchased software are recorded at cost 
commencing the month following project completion  these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the software  ranging from three to ten years 
software development costs may become impaired due to technological obsolescence of the project or where development efforts are abandoned due to changes in business plans 
for purposes of depreciation and impairment  capitalized costs are treated in the same manner as other property and equipment 

table of contents goodwill and other intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  totaled million as of december   which represented of total assets 
the company analyzes goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment issues on an annual basis or more frequently if events or circumstances warrant 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets  the company must make estimates regarding future cash flows and assumptions about other factors to determine the fair value 
changes in estimates or the related assumptions may cause the company to record impairment charges for the related assets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
chargebacks and other contingencies the company records reserves for chargebacks and other contingent liabilities when such amounts are deemed to be probable and estimable in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments including but not limited to changes in litigation or increased chargeback exposure as the result of merchant insolvency  liquidation  or other reasons 
the required reserves are reviewed periodically to determine if adjustments are required

forward looking results of operations airlines the company currently processes card transactions for several of the largest airlines in the united states 
airline customers represented approximately of the company s consolidated revenue from merchant card services and from payment services for the year ended december  in the event of liquidation of one or more of the company s airline customers  the company could become financially responsible for refunding tickets purchased through visa or mastercard under the chargeback rules of those associations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
at december   the dollar value of tickets purchased  but as yet unflown  was approximately billion 
based upon available information  this is management s best estimate of maximum potential chargebacks related to its airline customers 
as of december   ncbk held million in merchant deposits and withheld settlement funds for certain airline merchants 
the merchant deposits collateralize only individual airline merchants and some airline merchants have no deposits 
of the total merchant deposits  million was related to a single airline merchant 
in the near term  management believes liquidations are unlikely for any of the company s airline customers 
us airways group  inc and united air lines  inc  both of which are merchant processing customers of the company  have filed for bankruptcy court protection under chapter based upon information currently available to the company and actions management has taken to mitigate risks  management currently believes a material loss under the chargeback rules is unlikely 

table of contents in may  the company announced its decision to discontinue processing debit and credit card transactions for the airline industry 
the company will honor its existing contractual obligations to the airlines it currently serves but does not intend to renew such contracts when their current terms expire 
the contracts currently in effect have various expiration dates extending through november additional factors the company s revenues are directly affected by overall consumer spending trends 
the company is also currently experiencing increased pricing pressure in competing for new national merchants as well as in the renewal of existing national merchant contracts 
these factors may affect the company s future operating profits and margins 
recent accounting pronouncements goodwill and other intangible assets in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires business combinations initiated after june  to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting and broadens the criteria for recording intangible assets separate from goodwill 
under the provisions of sfas  goodwill and certain other intangible assets  which do not possess finite useful lives  will no longer be amortized over the estimated life but rather will be tested at least annually for impairment based on specific guidance provided in the new standard 
intangible assets determined to have finite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives and also continue to be subject to impairment testing 
the provisions of sfas were adopted by the company as required effective january  as part of adopting the provisions of sfas  a transitional impairment test was applied to all goodwill during the quarter ended march  no impairment was required to be recorded as a result of this test 
the company currently does not have any other indefinite lived intangible assets on its balance sheet 
there have not been any material categorical reclassifications or adjustments to the useful lives of finite lived intangible assets as a result of adopting the new standard 
if the non amortization provisions of sfas had been adopted effective january   goodwill amortization expense  which is primarily nondeductible for income tax purposes  would have been reduced by million and million for years ended december  and  respectively 
for the year ended december   proforma net income would have been million  or per diluted share  versus reported net income of million  or per diluted share 
for the year ended december   proforma net income would have been million or per diluted share  versus reported net income of million  or per diluted share 
the company s amortizable intangible assets as of december  related almost exclusively to acquired merchant portfolios 
these costs are amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from to years 
amortization expense for years ended december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
the estimated annual amortization expense for existing intangible assets for each of the next five years is as follows million  million   and million 
in general  application of the new provisions may result in more income statement volatility due to the potential periodic recognition of impairment losses  which are likely to vary in amount and regularity  for goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets  versus reducing those assets through the recognition of recurring  consistent amortization amounts 
accounting for long lived assets sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  was issued in october and addresses how and when to measure impairment on long lived assets and how to account for long lived assets that an entity plans to dispose of either through sale  abandonment  exchange  or distribution to owners 
the new provisions supersede sfas  which addressed asset impairment  and certain provisions of apb opinion related to reporting the effects of the disposal of a business segment and requires expected future operating losses from discontinued operations to be recorded in the period in which the losses are incurred rather than the measurement date 
under sfas  more dispositions may qualify for discontinued 
table of contents operations treatment in the income statement 
the provisions of sfas became effective for the company on january  and did not have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  was issued in september and addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost is recognized at the date of the entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas become effective for the company on january  and are not anticipated to have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position  or liquidity 
accounting for stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which provides guidance on how to transition from the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under apb to sfas s fair value method of accounting  if a company so selects 
effective january   the company plans to adopt the fair value method of recording stock options under sfas in accordance with the transitional guidance of sfas  the fair value method of accounting for stock options will be applied prospectively to awards granted subsequent to december  as permitted  options granted prior to january   will continue to be accounted for under apb opinion  and the proforma impact of accounting for these options at fair value will continue to be disclosed in the consolidated financial statements until the last of those options vest in as the cost of anticipated future option awards is phased in over a four year period  the annual impact will rise assuming options are granted in future years at a similar level and under similar market conditions to the actual impact per diluted share may vary in the event the fair value or the number of options granted increases or decreases from the current estimate  or if the current accounting guidance changes 
the company uses the black scholes model to estimate option values 
the black scholes option pricing model was originally developed for use in estimating the fair value of traded options  which have different characteristics from the company s employee stock options 
the model is also sensitive to changes in subjective assumptions  which can materially affect the fair value estimate 
accounting for guarantees in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin expands the disclosures made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees and requires the guarantor to recognize a liability with a corresponding reduction in revenue for the fair value of the obligation assumed under certain guarantees 
the company s contingent obligation to honor chargebacks see note to the consolidated financial statements under merchant contracts is considered a performance guarantee under fin performance guarantees are contracts that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on another entity s failure to perform under an obligating agreement 
performance guarantees are subject to both the recognition and disclosure requirements of fin the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for the company as of december  the required disclosures are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the recognition requirements of fin will require the company to establish a liability at the inception of a guarantee based on an estimate of the guarantee s fair value 
the recognition requirements are to be applied prospectively to new guarantees issued or modified after december  the company has not yet finalized the impact of adopting the recognition requirements of fin  however the company does not 
table of contents believe that fin will have a material impact on the company s results of operations  financial position or liquidity 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary uses of capital resources include capital expenditures  working capital and acquisitions 
future business acquisitions may be funded through current liquidity  borrowed funds  and or issuances of common stock 
the company s capital expenditures include amounts for computer hardware  external and internally developed software  and improvements to operating facilities 
during  the company s capital expenditures totaled million 
such expenditures were financed from operating cash flow  which for totaled million 
capital expenditures and operating cash flow for were million and million  respectively 
operating cash flow increased in due to lower year end accounts receivable balances and the timing of tax payments 
operating cash flow for was negatively impacted by higher year end accounts receivable balances

on july   the company acquired processing contracts from a key strategic partner for million cash 
the terms of the agreement also include future payments to the seller for a portion of the revenue derived from these contracts for a specified period plus an additional one time payment of up to million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
as the company does not carry significant amounts of inventory and historically has experienced short collection periods for its accounts receivable  it does not require substantial working capital to support revenue growth 
working capital requirements will vary depending upon future acquisition activity 
increases in working capital needs are expected to be financed through operating cash flow and current cash balances

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk derivative instruments the company does not use derivative instruments 
market risk of financial instruments the company s primary market risk exposure with regard to financial instruments is to changes in interest rates 
as of december   the company had million in cash and cash equivalents 
for the year ended december   ncbk also held an average of approximately million of customer cash balances 
the company retains incremental interest earned on certain of these funds above what is contractually due to the customers 
interest earned on customer cash balances is included as a component of revenue 
because of the short term nature of these instruments  a sudden change in market interest rates would not impact the fair value of these instruments 
the company s earnings  however  are affected by changes in interest rates  with respect to interest on the company s cash and cash equivalents as well as on customer funds maintained by ncbk 
at december   a hypothetical basis point increase in short term interest rates would result in an increase of approximately million in annual pre tax income 
a hypothetical basis point decrease in short term interest rates would result in a decrease of approximately million in annual pre tax income
