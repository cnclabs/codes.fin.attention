item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations overview we provide base stations and other wireless telecommunications infrastructure products designed to support the gsm system of mobile voice and data transmission 
we have substantial intellectual experience in the wireless industry and products and market our products worldwide to operators of wireless networks 
a base station is a key component of a wireless network and is used to receive and transmit voice and data signals over radio frequencies 
our products include the adaptacell base station  a software defined base station  meaning it uses software to control the way it encodes and decodes voice and data wireless signals  and the airsite backhaul free base station  which carries voice and data signals back to the wireline network without using a physical communications link 
these products are continually evolving 
from our inception in january through may  our operations consisted principally of start up activity associated with the design  development  and marketing of our products 
we did not generate significant revenues until and have generated only million in net revenues from our inception through december  we have incurred substantial losses since commencing operations  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
we have not achieved profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
as we continue to build our customer and revenue base we expect to continue to incur net losses at least through we will need to generate significantly higher revenues in order to support research and development  sales and marketing and general and administrative expenses  and to achieve and maintain profitability 
see liquidity  capital resources  and going concern below 
we began marketing our gsm base stations in the beginning of and shipped our first gsm base station in may through december   our base stations were being used in twenty two deployed systems 
we currently sell and market our products in the us through our direct sales force 
internationally  we sell our products through our direct sales force  as well as through agents and oems 
our revenues are derived from sales of a product line based on the gsm standard 
we generate a substantial portion of our revenues from a limited number of customers  with three customers accounting for of our net revenues during the fiscal year ended december  for the fiscal years ended december    and    and  respectively  of our revenues were from international deployments  respectively 
we expect our percentage of international revenues to increase as a result of our expansion of international sales and distribution activities 

table of contents during  we experienced a significant period of transition 
in mid  management undertook a strategic review of the business and established the following objectives for the future simplify the business  reduce the cost structure and move towards the path to long term sustainable profitability 
in connection with these objectives  we took action during the second and third quarters to reduce costs and discretionary expenditures  negotiated settlements with vendors on existing accounts payable balances  undertook efforts to better leverage our technology base and entrepreneurial culture to target new market opportunities  and redirected our activities to focus in four interrelated areas the growing market for secure  adaptable wireless infrastructure for governmental and public safety applications  our adaptive array technology for our adaptacell supercapacity base station  the rapidly emerging gsm market for migration of is networks to gsm and high speed data  and our traditional gsm infrastructure market 
while market demand continues to be uncertain  we believe our strategy and new direction offer the most stable and attractive opportunities for us 
these four areas are interrelated and address the same basic market  that is  the wireless infrastructure market 
we have had and expect to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in our quarterly revenues as a result of our long and variable sales cycle 
historically  our sales cycle  which is the period from the time a sales lead is generated until the recognition of revenue  has ranged up to eighteen months in time 
the length and variability of our sales cycle is influenced by a number of factors beyond our control  including our customers build out and deployment schedules  our customers access to product purchase financing  our customers degree of familiarity with our products  the need for functional demonstrations and field trials  the manufacturing lead time for our products  delays in final acceptance of products following shipments  regulatory developments  and our revenue recognition policies 
the effect of our potentially long sales cycle on our results is compounded by our current dependence on a small number of customers 
in general  our gross margins will be affected by the following factors demand for our products and services  new product introductions  both by us and our competitors  changes in our pricing policies and those of our competitors  the mix of base stations and other products sold  the mix of sales channels through which our products are sold  engineering cost reduction successes  access to the best vendors from a cost and technology viewpoint  the mix of domestic and international sales  and the volume pricing we are able to obtain from contract manufacturers and third party vendors 
we currently obtain all of our primary components and subassemblies for our products from a limited number of independent contract manufacturers and purchase circuit boards  electronic and mechanical parts and other component assemblies from a limited number of oems and other selected vendors 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenues consists of payments to these suppliers 
the remainder of our cost of revenues is related to our in house manufacturing operations  which consist primarily of quality control  procurement and material management  final assembly  testing  and product integration 
research and development expenses consist primarily of expenses incurred in the design  development and support of our proprietary technology 
we expect research and development expenses to stabilize as we complete the development of our core technology 
research and development associated with future products will depend on customer requirements 
we may  however  incur costs in connection with the development of the software needed to upgrade our base stations to support emerging wireless high speed data transmission standards 
the cost incurred for the software development performed by third parties through development agreements are carried on the balance sheet as an intangible asset until the product is deployed 
at that time the cost will be amortized over the life of the product 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions  consulting fees  trade show expenses  advertising  marketing expenses and general support costs 
we intend to maintain expenditures for selling and marketing in order to support distribution channels  strategic relationships  sales and marketing personnel  a x customer service center  rf services  field service support  and marketing programs 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of expenses for finance  office operations  administrative and general management activities  including legal  accounting  human resources  and other professional fees and reserves for receivables and bad debts 
on may  we were notified by the sec that it had performed what we believe was a routine review of our annual report on form k for the year ended december  and requested clarification or explanation on some items 
on june   we provided the requested clarification and explanation without amending or restating previous filings 
there have been no further questions raised by the sec 
management does not anticipate any further questions on this review 
related party transactions see item regarding a description of related party transactions during 
table of contents year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase in revenues was a result of two major orders received for installations ultimately in the overseas market 
gross profit gross profit increased million from a loss of million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the gross profit margin was for and for the increase in the gross profit margin was primarily attributable to a substantial decrease in inventory related charges  including write downs for certain obsolete and excess inventory of million during and our ability to leverage existing inventory to support the increase in revenue without significant procurement of new material 
in addition  warranty expense decreased by million in the period ended december  versus the year ended december  we expect our gross margin percentage to decline from our year ended december  level during the first six months of or until our cost reduction program is completed and products begin to ship 
in addition  the slow moving inventory  not previously written off  as of december  was million  which may be written down in the future if usage remains low resulting in decreased gross profit 
based upon our estimated view that the telecommunications market will experience a turnaround in the future  our improved product mix  a reduction of one time charges  successful implementation of cost reductions  and the refocus of our efforts in the new directions discussed previously  we expect our gross margin percentage to improve in the future 
however  future market conditions and economic conditions could affect the achievement of this objective 
research and development research and development expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was due to previously announced actions taken in the second and third quarters of to reduce operating expenses which included actions to focus development in the areas with the greatest near term potential 
the million dollar decrease included a million reduction in labor and benefit costs  a million reduction in consulting and subcontractor expenses  a million reduction in expensed r d equipment  a million reduction in travel and recruiting expenses  and a million reduction in leased equipment 
the research and development expenses for the year ended december  included an accrual of approximately million for bonuses accrued under a board approved bonuses program that were scheduled to be paid in january we are deferring the payment of these bonuses until such time as payment is approved by the two entities considering a funding agreement with the company

see liquidity  capital resource and going concerns below 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  the million reduction in expenses was primarily attributable to the recovery of receivables previously accounted for in the provision for doubtful accounts of million 
in addition  there was a reduction in the provision for doubtful accounts of million  and a million reduction in outside legal services 
savings initiatives were also accomplished through a reduction in the aggregate workforce of the company  consolidation of facilities  and an adjustment in certain business functions  streamlining the organization

gain on vendor settlements the company recorded a gain on vendor settlements of  during as compared to  during the current year gain was a result of the finalization of a company program to enter into agreements with certain vendors to settle outstanding payables in exchange for releasing the company from future obligations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenues net revenues decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease in revenues was a result of the deterioration in global telecommunications market conditions and a reduction in capital spending by service providers  leading to a reduction in orders received from active customers and difficulties in obtaining orders from potential new customers 
gross profit gross profit decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to a loss of million for the year ended december  the gross profit margin was for and for the decrease in the gross profit margin was primarily attributable to an increase in inventory related charges  including write downs for certain obsolete and excess inventory of million and the decrease in revenue volume during discussed above 
in addition  warranty expense increased by million due to the airsite warranty replacement program whereby we replaced defective parts in over airsites 
the expense was incurred during the first six months of and is not expected to continue 
research and development research and development expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease resulted from the actions taken during the fiscal year ended december  to limit discretionary spending 
these actions included focusing development in the areas with the greatest near term revenue potential 
sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses increased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this increase was attributable to costs associated with an expansion in the first half of 
table of contents for anticipated international orders and distribution activities and support of large operator trials 
one of these trials resulted in revenue booked during gain on vendor settlements the company recorded a gain on vendor settlements of  during as compared to during the gain was a result of a company program to enter into agreements with certain vendors to settle outstanding payables in exchange for releasing the company from future obligations 
general and administrative general and administrative expenses decreased million or from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  this decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the provision for bad debts  and our directed savings initiatives limiting and focusing discretionary spending 
the savings initiatives were accomplished through a reduction in the aggregate workforce of the company  consolidation of facilities  and an adjustment in certain business functions streamlining the organization 
these savings initiatives are reflected in a greatly reduced level of general and administrative expenses as a percent of revenue generated in the fourth quarter of liquidity  capital resources  and going concern the accompanying financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which contemplates the realization of assets and the satisfaction of liabilities in the normal course of business  and  as a consequence  the financial statements do not include any adjustments relating to the recoverability and classification of recorded asset amounts or the amounts and classifications of liabilities that might be necessary should we be unable to continue as a going concern 
we have experienced net operating losses and negative cash flows since inception and  as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
cash used in operations for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
we expect to have an operating loss in at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents 
such conditions raise substantial doubt that we will be able to continue as a going concern without receiving additional funding 
as of march  our cash balance was million  after the draw of million against our bridge loan for interim funding 
the amounts drawn against the bridge loan are due and payable on may  in addition  on the same date we had a revenue backlog of million 
our current operating plan projects that cash available from planned revenue combined with the million on hand at march  will not be adequate to defer the requirement for additional funding 
we are currently negotiating additional financing of million with two investors  which if successful  a portion will be used to pay off the bridge loan would provide the capital we require to continue operations 
there can be no assurances that the proposed financing can be finalized on terms acceptable to us  if at all  or that the funding negotiated will be adequate to sustain operations through our future results of operations involve a number of significant risks and uncertainties 
the worldwide market for telecommunications products such as those sold by us has seen dramatic reductions in demand as compared to the late s and it is uncertain as to when or whether market conditions will improve 
we have been negatively impacted by this reduction in global demand and by our weak balance sheet 
other factors that could affect our future operating results and cause actual results to vary from expectations include  but are not limited to  ability to raise capital  dependence on key personnel  dependence on a limited number of customers with one customer accounting for of the revenue for  ability to design new products  the erosion of product prices  ability to overcome deployment and installation challenges in developing countries which may include political and civil risks and risks relating to environmental conditions  product obsolescence  ability to generate consistent sales  ability to finance research and development  government regulation  technological innovations and acceptance  competition  reliance on certain vendors and credit risks 
our ultimate ability to continue as a going concern for a reasonable period of time will depend on our increasing our revenues and or reducing our expenses and securing enough additional funding to enable us to reach profitability 
our historical sales results and our current backlog do not give us sufficient visibility or predictability to indicate when the required higher sales levels might be achieved  if at all 
additional funding will be required prior to reaching profitability 
to obtain additional funding  we have entered into discussions with scp ii and tecore concerning a proposed financing of  discussed below 
no assurances can be given that either the proposed financing or additional equity or debt financing will be arranged on terms acceptable to us  if at all 
if we are unable to finalize the proposed financing  we will have to seek additional funding or dramatically reduce our expenditures and it is likely that we will be required to discontinue operations 
it is unlikely that we will achieve profitable operations in the near term and therefore it is likely our operations will continue to consume cash in the foreseeable future 
we have limited cash resources and therefore we must reduce our negative cash flows in the near term to continue operations 
there can be no assurances that we will succeed in achieving our goals or finalize the proposed financing  and failure to do so in the near term will have a material adverse effect on our business  prospects  financial condition and operating results and our ability to continue as a going concern 
as a consequence  we may be forced to seek protection under the bankruptcy laws 
in that event  it is unclear whether we could successfully reorganize our capital structure and operations  or whether we could realize sufficient value for our assets to satisfy fully our debts 
accordingly  should we file for bankruptcy there is no assurance that our stockholders would receive any value 
prior to our initial public offering in december  which raised net proceeds of million  we funded our operations primarily through the private sales of equity securities and through capital equipment leases 
at december   our principal source of liquidity was million of cash and cash equivalents 
on may   we issued and sold  shares of preferred stock to three existing stockholders  scp private equity partners ii  lp scp ii  tandem pcs investments tandem  lp and mellon ventures lp mellon  at per share for a total face value of million 
the preferred stock is redeemable at any time after may  out of funds legally available for such purposes and initially each share of preferred stock is convertible  at any time  into ten shares of our common stock 
dividends accrue to the preferred stockholders  whether or not declared  at cumulatively per annum 
the preferred stockholders are entitled to votes equal to the number of shares of common stock into which each share of preferred stock converts and collectively to designate two members of the board of directors 
upon liquidation of the company  or if a majority of the preferred stockholders agree to treat a change in control or a sale of all or substantially all of our assets with certain exceptions as a liquidation  the preferred stockholders are entitled to of their initial purchase price plus accrued but unpaid dividends before any payments to any other stockholders 
in association with this preferred stock investment  we issued immediately exercisable warrants to purchase  shares of our common stock for per share  which expire on may  the proceeds from the sale of the preferred stock were used to fund our operations from may into effective october   the preferred stockholders irrevocably and permanently waived the right of optional redemption applicable to the series b preferred stock as set forth in the certificate of designation and the right to treat a specific proposed sale of the corporation as a liquidation event  to the extent that such treatment would entitle the series b holders to receive their liquidation amount per share in a form different from the consideration to be paid to holders of our common stock in connection with such sale of the corporation 
on january   we entered into a bridge loan agreement with scp ii  an affiliate of our chairman  james w 
brown  and tecore  inc  our largest customer based on revenues during the fiscal year ended december   and a supplier of switching equipment to us tecore 
we issued two bridge loan promissory notes under the bridge loan agreement  each in a principal amount of million the bridge notes or the bridge loan 
the bridge notes carry an interest rate of two percent over the prime rate published in the wall street journal and become due and payable on may  the bridge loan agreement provides that the bridge notes are secured by a security interest in all of our assets including  without limitation  our intellectual property 
to date  we have received advances totaling million under the bridge notes 
we are currently negotiating a definitive funding agreement  under which scp ii and tecore would provide us financing of million in the form of secured notes convertible into our common stock 
the proceeds of this proposed financing would be used to refund the advances under the bridge loan agreement and to fund our operations 
see note to financial statements  subsequent events  for a further explanation of the bridge loan agreement and the proposed financing 

table of contents net cash used in operating activities net cash used in operating activities was approximately million in  million in and million in for the year ended december  the cash provided through customer deposits and a reduction in both inventories and receivables was offset by the net loss incurred 
we were able to reduce our inventory balance through fulfillment of customer orders 
as of december   our net accounts receivable balance was million 
of this balance is attributable to two customers 
during the years ended december  and the significant use of cash by operating activities was the result of the net losses together with the payment of accrued expenses associated with a reduction in workforce and the reduction in accounts payable resulting from the vendor settlements offset by gains discussed previously 
except for sales to oems or to customers under agreements providing for acceptance concurrent with shipment  our customers are billed as contractual milestones are met 
deposits ranging between and of the contracted amount typically are received at the inception of the contract and an additional percentage of the contracted amount is generally billed upon shipment 
the terms vary from contract to contract but are always agreed to in the initial contract 
most of the remaining unbilled amounts are invoiced after a customer has placed the products in service  completed specified acceptance testing procedures or has otherwise accepted the product 
collection of the entire amounts due under our contracts to date have lagged behind shipment of our products due to the time period between shipment and fulfillment of all of our applicable post shipment contractual obligations  the time at which we bill the remaining balance of the contracted amount 
this lag will require an increase in investments in working capital as our revenues increase 
as of december   our total notes receivable balance was million  all of which was attributable to one customer 
the customer is making monthly payments of principal and interest to satisfy this note receivable 
net cash used in investing activities we used net cash for capital expenditures of approximately million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
during  we significantly reduced the level of capital expenditures  as the physical assets available are adequate to meet our needs at this time 
our capital expenditures for testing and manufacturing equipment used during final assembly of our products will increase if our revenues increase 
we lease our primary manufacturing and office facilities under long term non cancelable operating leases 
we also have operating leases for certain other furniture  equipment and computers 
we used net cash for operating leases of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
future minimum payments for operating leases including payments under our new lease for final assembly and testing facilities in melbourne  florida aggregated through the year were approximately million as of december  and we expect to spend approximately  for those leases in net cash provided by used in financing activities net cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  was million resulted primarily from the payments on capital leases of million 
we had no debt facilities outstanding as of december  on january  we issued two bridge loan promissory notes in an aggregate of million  to two investors with an initial draw of million 
maximum cumulative draws  including the initial draw of million may be made according to the following schedule draw down date cummulative amount prior to february  prior to march  prior to april  on or after april  
table of contents as of march   in accordance with the above schedule  the investors have advanced a total of million to the company  the most recent advance of million having been made on march  there can be no assurance that the final draw of million against the bridge loan will be fulfilled as we request  if at all 
net cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was million and was due to net proceeds received from the sale of convertible preferred stock in may of million a portion of which was used to reduce accounts payable in our vendor settlement program 
net cash used by financing activities for the year ended december  of million resulted primarily from the payments on capital leases of million offset by the cash provided from the exercise of stock options raising million 
we lease certain computer and test equipment under capital lease arrangements 
we used net cash for capital leases of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   december  and december   respectively 
future minimum payments for capital leases aggregated through the year were approximately  as of december  critical accounting policies and estimates we continually evaluate the accounting policies and estimates that we use to prepare our financial statements 
in general  management s estimates are based on historical experience  on information from third party professionals and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the facts and circumstances 
actual results could differ from those estimates made by management 
revenue recognition revenue from product sales is recognized after delivery and determination that the fee is fixed and determinable  collectibilty is probable  and after the resolution of uncertainties regarding satisfaction of significant terms and conditions of the customer contract 
revenue for sales to oems is recognized when title to the product passes to the oem customer 
typically  for these product sales  title passes to the customer at the point of shipment 
allowance for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
the allowance is reduced when a customer which previously was deemed a collection risk makes payments to the company eliminating the need for the allowance or when a receivable is written off 
accounting for inventories we write down our inventories for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based on assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write offs may be required beyond the writeoff that was previously taken 
long lived assets we review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
long lived assets totaled million as of december  including licensing and software development costs 
upon our determination that the carrying value of the asset is impaired  we would record an impairment charge or loss 
unsuccessful product marketing or continued substantial operating losses could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment  and therefore  might require an impairment charge in the future 
other information pursuant to section of the sarbanes oxley act of  the chief executive officer and chief financial officer of the company have provided certain certifications to the securities and exchange commission 
these certificates accompanied this report when filed with the commission 
status of our common stock listing on nasdaq national market all companies listed on the nasdaq national market are required to have net tangible assets of million  total stockholders equity of million  and a minimum bid price of at least per share or a minimum bid price of at least per share with no net tangible asset requirement 
if a stock fails to trade at that level for thirty consecutive business days  nasdaq will notify the company of its deficiency in writing 
the company then has ninety days to cure the deficiency and return its stock to compliance for at least ten consecutive business days but possibly longer at the discretion of nasdaq 
we have not complied with nasdaq s listing requirement of a minimum bid price of per share since september and were notified of this deficiency by nasdaq october  and had until january  to cure this deficiency 
on march   we received a notice from nasdaq that the compliance period was extended for an additional ninety days 
as a result  we have until april  to satisfy the minimum bid price requirement 
in addition  under the nasdaq listing requirements  a company s board of directors must have an audit committee consisting of at least three members comprised solely of independent directors as defined under the nasdaq rules 
our audit committee currently consists of two members  each of whom we believe qualifies as an independent director 
our board of directors has appointed gerald y 
hattori to fill a vacant seat on the board effective on april  mr 
hattori  who is a former chief financial officer of the company  is expected to serve as the third independent director on our audit committee and may qualify as a financial expert as defined under the new federal corporate governance rules 
should nasdaq proceed with delisting  we intend to appeal

the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties not presently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial may also impair our business operations

a long lasting downturn in the global economy that impacts the wireless communications industry could negatively affect our revenues and operating results 
the global economy is in the midst of a slowdown that has had wide ranging effects on markets that we serve  particularly wireless communications equipment manufacturers and network operators 
this downturn has had a negative effect on our revenues 
we cannot predict the depth or duration of this downturn  and if it grows more severe or continues for a long period of time  our ability to increase or maintain our revenues and operating results may be impaired 
in addition  because we intend to continue to invest in research and development during this downturn and to maintain ongoing customer service and support capability  any decline in the rate of growth of our revenues will have a significant adverse impact on our operating results 
current economic conditions affecting the wireless communications industry may lead prospective and existing customers to postpone their purchasing decisions 
the industry wide decrease in demand for wireless telecommunications infrastructure has adversely affected us 
we cannot predict when the demand will increase or when many of our customers and potential customers will start to make significant purchases of our products 
we have incurred significant losses since we began doing business 
we anticipate continuing losses and may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we have accumulated losses of million since we began doing business in through december   and we may never achieve or sustain profitability 
we will need to generate significantly higher revenues to achieve and sustain profitability 
since we began doing business in  we have generated million in net revenues through december  we have been marketing our gsm base stations since we have never reported a profit 
we will continue to incur significant research and product development  sales and marketing  materials and general administrative expenses  and we expect our expenses to increase as compared to prior periods  as we expand our sales force and our international operations 
we anticipate a net loss for the year and we may continue to incur losses beyond we cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenues or margins to sustain our business 
we may not be able to obtain additional capital to fund our operations on reasonable terms and this could hurt our business and negatively impact our stockholders 
if adequate funds in the form of equity or debt are not available on reasonable terms or terms acceptable to us  we may be unable to continue as a going concern 
if we raise additional funds through the issuance of convertible debt or additional equity securities  the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders may be reduced  the securities issued may have rights  preferences and privileges senior to those of holders of our common stock  and the terms of the securities may impose restrictions on our operations 
while the vendors holding a security interest in our assets have agreed to subordinate their liens to a secured lender who loans at least million to us  until these vendors are paid in full  we may not be able to borrow secured financing of less than million 
we have secured commitments for interim financing in the amount of million from tecore and scp ii  and have drawn down a total of million against the bridge loan to date but the terms of the interim financing required us to pledge all of our assets as collateral 
in addition  there can be no assurances that the final advance under the bridge loan of million will be made in a timely manner 
if the proposed million financing by scp ii and tecore does not close  we may be forced to seek protection under the federal bankruptcy laws 
if the investors determine not to proceed with the proposed financing or our stockholders do not approve it  the investors could demand payment when the bridge notes become due on may  if we are unable to raise capital from another source or are otherwise unable to pay the principal amount and accrued interest on the bridge notes when due  the investors could foreclose on the bridge notes and force a sale of our assets  including our intellectual property 
under such circumstances  we are likely to cease operations or file for protection from claims of our creditors under the federal bankruptcy laws 
the proposed financing would significantly dilute the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders 
if shares of our common stock are issued to the investors upon conversion of the secured convertible notes to be issued pursuant to the proposed financing and any interest due on the notes or exercise of the warrants  existing stockholders would have their ownership percentage substantially diluted 
the number of shares of common stock issuable under the terms of the proposed financing will also affect our earnings per share on a going forward basis 
the larger the number of shares deemed outstanding  the lower the earnings per share will be 
the actual effect of the proposed financing on our earnings per share will depend on the level of our earnings in future periods  the actual conversion prices of the notes and the impact of the accounting treatment of the proposed financing 
we have a limited operating history 
you should not rely on our recent results as an indication of our future results 
our base stations are being used in twenty five commercially deployed systems 
we had net revenues of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
unless we can achieve significant increases in market acceptance of our products  we may never advance beyond our market penetration phase 
due to our limited operating history  it is difficult or impossible for us to predict future results and you should not expect future revenue growth based on our recent results 
you should consider our business and prospects in light of the risks and problems faced by technology companies in the early stages of development 

table of contents our operating results are subject to substantial quarterly and annual fluctuations and to market downturns 
our revenues  earnings and other operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and may fluctuate significantly in the future 
general economic or other conditions causing a downturn in the market for our products or technology  affecting the timing of customer orders or causing cancellations or rescheduling of orders could also adversely affect our operating results 
moreover  our customers may change delivery schedules or cancel or reduce orders without incurring significant penalties and generally are not subject to minimum purchase requirements 
our future operating results will be affected by many factors  including the following changes in the growth rate of the wireless communications industry  consolidation in the wireless communications industry  the collectibility of our trade receivables  our ability to retain existing or secure anticipated customers or orders  both domestically and internationally  the availability and cost of products and services from our third party suppliers  our ability to develop  introduce and market new technology  products and services on a timely basis  foreign currency fluctuations  inflation and deflation  decreases in average selling prices or demand for our products  intellectual property disputes and litigation  government regulations  product defects  management of inventory in response to shifts in market demand  and changes in the mix of technology and products developed  produced and sold 
the foregoing factors are difficult to forecast and these  as well as other factors  could harm our quarterly or annual operating results 
if our operating results fail to meet the expectations of investment analysts or investors in any period  the market price of our common stock may decline 
our lengthy and variable sales cycle makes it difficult for us to predict if and when a sale will be made and could cause us operating difficulties and cash flow problems 
our sales cycle  which is the period from the generation of a sales lead until the recognition of revenue  can be long and is unpredictable  making it difficult to forecast revenues and operating results 
our inability to accurately predict the timing and magnitude of our sales could cause a number of problems we may have difficulty meeting our customers delivery requirements in the event many large orders are received in a short period of time because we have limited production capacity and generally do not carry materials in inventory  we may expend significant management efforts and incur substantial sales and marketing expenses in a particular period that do not translate into orders during that period or at all  and we may have difficulty meeting our cash flow requirements and obtaining credit because of delays in receiving orders and because the terms of many of our customer contracts defer certain billings until post shipment contractual milestones are met 
the problems resulting from our lengthy and variable sales cycle could impede our growth  harm our stock price  and restrict our ability to take advantage of new opportunities 
our stock price is volatile 
the stock market in general  and the stock prices of technology based companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of any specific public company 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future as well 
factors that may have a significant impact on the market price of our stock include 
table of contents announcements concerning us or our competitors  receipt of substantial orders for base stations  quality deficiencies in services or products  announcements regarding financial developments or technological innovations  international developments  such as technology mandates  political developments or changes in economic policies  new commercial products  changes in recommendations of securities analysts  government regulations  acts of terrorism or war  proprietary rights or product or patent litigation  or strategic transactions  such as acquisitions and divestitures 
our future earnings and stock price may be subject to significant volatility  particularly on a quarterly basis 
shortfalls in our revenues or earnings in any given period relative to the levels expected by securities analysts could immediately  significantly and adversely affect the trading price of our common stock 
our stock price may decline significantly if we are delisted from the nasdaq national market 
for continued inclusion on the nasdaq national market system  we must meet certain tests  including a minimum bid price of 
we currently are not in compliance with the bid price requirement  although we have until april  to cure this deficiency 
if we fail to satisfy the listing standards in the future  nasdaq may de list our common stock from its national market system 
if this occurs  trading of our common stock may be conducted on the nasdaq smallcap market  the otc bulletin board or in the over the counter market on the pink sheets 
in any of those cases  investors could find it more difficult to buy or sell  or to obtain accurate quotations as to the value of our common stock 
the trading price per share of our common stock likely would be reduced as a result 
we currently do not meet the minimum listing requirements for the nasdaq national market our bid price is less than per share 
in addition  we may be delisted because our audit committee does not consist of three independent directors 
intense competition in the market for wireless telecommunications equipment from many larger  more established companies with greater resources could prevent us from increasing our revenue and achieving profitability 
the wireless telecommunications infrastructure market is highly competitive 
we compete with large infrastructure manufacturers  systems integrators  and base station subsystem suppliers  as well as new market entrants 
most of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories and presence in key markets  larger installed customer bases  substantially greater name recognition  and more financial  technical  manufacturing  marketing  sales  distribution and other resources than we do 
we may not be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  including companies that develop and market new wireless telecommunications products and services 
these competitive pressures may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins  longer sales cycles and loss of customers 
in addition roaming considerations may impede our sales in the north american market 
competition in the telecommunications market is based on varying combinations  including comprehensiveness of product and technology solutions  manufacturing capability  scalability and the ability of the system solution to meet customers immediate and future network requirements  product performance and quality  design and engineering capabilities  compliance with industry standards  time to market  system cost  and customer support 
we anticipate that additional competitors will enter our markets as a result of growth opportunities in wireless telecommunications  the trend toward global expansion by foreign and domestic competitors  technological and public policy changes and relatively low barriers to entry in selected segments of the industry 
as a result of these factors  these competitors may be more successful than we are 
in addition  we anticipate additional competitors will enter the market for products based on g standards 
these competitors may have more established relationships and distribution channels in markets not currently deploying wireless communications technology 
these competitors also have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with our existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
these relationships may affect 
table of contents customers decisions to purchase products from us 
accordingly  new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share to our detriment 
our comparative inability to provide financing for our customers is a competitive disadvantage and could result in a loss of sales and or customers to competitors with greater resources 
we do not typically offer financing to our customers  which could cause us to lose business to our larger competitors 
our future success may depend upon our continuing ability to help arrange financing for our customers 
if we cannot assist in arranging financing for our customers  we may lose sales and customers to competitors that directly provide financing 
credit risk problems resulting from customer financing could hurt our results and require us to raise additional capital 
many of our customers and potential customers are start up and small companies with a limited operating history 
in some instances  we have provided and will continue to provide customer financing 
we face credit risks  including slow payments or non payments from customers  and we may need to raise additional capital to support financed sales and to deal with related credit risk problems 
a small number of customers account for substantially all of our revenues and the loss of any of these customers could hurt our results and cause our stock price to decline 
our customer base has been and may continue to be concentrated with a small number of customers 
the loss of any of these customers or the delay  reduction or cancellation of orders by or shipments to any of these customers could hurt our results and cause a decline in our stock price 
the effect of these risks on our operating results is compounded by our lengthy sales cycle 
in  sales to three customers accounted for of our total revenue 
in sales to five customers accounted for and in sales to three customers accounted for of total revenue 
the chart below shows the breakout by fiscal year of the concentration of revenue years ended december  customer a 
customer b 
customer c 
customer d 
customer e 
customer f 
customer g 
customer h 
we have a concentrated customer base and the failure of any of our customers to pay us or to pay us on time could cause significant cash flow problems  hurt our results and cause our stock price to decline 
our concentrated customer base significantly increases the credit risks associated with slow payments or non payments by our customers 
these risks are also higher for us since many of our customers are start up and small companies 
two customers accounted for of our outstanding accounts receivable as of december   with one customer representing 
two customers accounted for of our combined outstanding accounts and notes receivable as of december  three customers represented of our combined outstanding accounts and notes receivable as of december  in the past we have incurred bad debt charges and we may be required to do so in the future 
the failure of any of our customers to pay us  or to pay us on time  causes significant cash flow problems  hurts our results and could cause our stock price to decline 
if we continue to expand into international markets  we will become subject to additional business risks 
we have begun marketing and selling our products internationally in africa  the middle east  asia and latin america 
our business plan contemplates that a majority of our sales over the next several years will be in international markets 
our revenues from international customers as a percentage of total revenues were in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal in many international markets  barriers to entry are created by long standing relationships between our potential customers and their local providers and protective regulations  including local content and service requirements 
in addition  our pursuit of international growth opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before we realize returns  if any  on our investments 
our international operations could be adversely affected by a variety of uncontrollable and changing risks and uncertainties  including difficulties and costs associated with obtaining foreign regulatory approval for our products  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties and costs associated with complying with a wide variety of complex foreign laws and treaties  legal uncertainties regarding  and timing delays and expenses associated with  tariffs  export licenses and other trade barriers  inadequate protection of intellectual property in foreign countries  increased difficulty in collecting delinquent or unpaid accounts  lack of suitable export financing  
table of contents adverse tax consequences  dependence upon independent sales representatives and other indirect resellers who may not be as effective and reliable as our employees  difficulties and costs associated with staffing and managing international operations  overcoming cultural  linguistic and nationalistic barriers and adapting to foreign business practices  political and economic instability  and currency fluctuations  including a decrease in the value of foreign currencies relative to the us dollar which could make our products less competitive against those of foreign competitors 
in addition to general risks associated with our international sales and operations  we are subject to risks specific to the individual countries in which we do business 
a portion of our international sales efforts will be targeted to service operators who plan to deploy wireless communications networks in developing countries where risks ordinarily associated with international operations are particularly acute  including developing countries in africa  asia  the middle east and latin america 
any of these factors could impair our ability to expand into international markets and could prevent us from increasing our revenues and achieving profitability 
our business and operating results may be harmed by inflation and deflation 
inflation has had and may continue to have adverse effects on the economies and securities markets of certain countries and could have adverse effects on our customers  including their ability to obtain financing and repay debts 
brazil and mexico  for example  have periodically experienced relatively high rates of inflation and currency devaluation 
significant inflation or deflation could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  liquidity and financial position 
if we do not succeed in the development of new products and product features in response to changing technology and standards  customers will not buy our products 
we need to develop new products and product features in response to the evolving demands for better technology or our customers will not buy our products 
the market for our products is characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  emerging wireless transmission standards  and frequent new product introductions and enhancements 
if we fail to develop our technology  we will lose significant potential market share to our competitors 
our failure to comply with evolving industry standards could delay our introduction of new products 
an international consortium of standards bodies has established the specifications for the third generation g wireless standard  and is further working to establish the specifications of a future wireless standard and its interoperability with existing standards 
any failure of our products to comply with g or future standards could delay their introduction and require costly and time consuming engineering changes 
after the future standard is adopted  any delays in our introduction of next generation products could impair our ability to grow revenues in the future 
as a result  we may be unable to achieve or sustain profitability 
even if we do develop our technology and products to work with these new standards  consumer demand for advanced wireless services may not be sufficient to justify network operators upgrading to them 
a reduction or interruption in component supply or a significant increase in component prices could have a material adverse effect on our business or profitability 
our ability to meet customer demands depends  in part  on our ability to obtain timely and adequate delivery of parts and components from our suppliers and internal manufacturing capacity 
we have experienced component shortages in the past  including components for our integrated circuit products  that have adversely affected our operations 
although we work closely with our suppliers to avoid these types of shortages  we may continue to encounter these problems in the future 
a reduction or interruption in component supply or a significant increase in the price or one or more components could have a material adverse effect on our business 
we may not be able to adequately protect or defend our proprietary rights  which would hurt our ability to compete 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  trade secrets  copyrights  and nondisclosure agreements and other measures  intellectual property is difficult to evaluate and these measures may not provide adequate protection for our proprietary rights and information 
patent filings by third parties  whether made before or after the date of our filings  could render our intellectual property less valuable 
competitors may misappropriate our proprietary rights and information  disputes as to ownership of intellectual property may arise  and our proprietary rights and information may otherwise become known or independently developed by competitors 
the failure to protect our proprietary rights could seriously harm our business  operating results and financial condition 
we have a relatively low number of inventions for which patents have been granted or patent applications are pending internationally 
if we do not obtain sufficient international protection for our intellectual property  our competitiveness in international markets could be significantly impaired  which would limit our growth and future revenues 
others may bring infringement claims against us that could be time consuming and expensive to defend 
in the future  claims of infringement of other parties proprietary rights  invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims may be asserted or prosecuted against us 
even if none of these claims were valid or successful  we would be forced to incur significant costs and divert important resources to defend against them 
any claim of infringement  whether or not successful  could cause us considerable expense and place a significant burden on our management 
a significant decrease in the cost of digital t e phone lines or microwave will diminish one of our competitive advantages 
existing base stations require an expensive physical communications link  usually through a digital t e phone line or microwave  to the wireline network 

table of contents any significant decrease in the cost of digital t e phone lines or microwave used to connect base stations to the wireline network  especially in less populated areas  will diminish a cost advantage that we currently use to market our products 
the cost of t e or microwave facilities has recently declined significantly in urban areas because of increased competition 
if we fail to expand our customer base beyond the smaller operators  we may not be able to significantly grow our revenues 
we will only be able to significantly grow our revenues if we can expand our customer base beyond the smaller operators 
there are a limited number of such operators and most of them have limited resources 
these operators are less stable and more susceptible to delays in their buildouts and deployments than more established operators 
we plan on expanding our sales to include the larger domestic operators and international operators 
however  as a result of the rapid consolidation of larger domestic gsm operators  there are only a few larger domestic operators remaining 
to date we have not had any sales to the larger domestic operators  and we may not be successful in those markets in the future 
our reliance on a limited number of suppliers could lead to delays  additional costs  problems with our customers and potential customers  and loss of revenue 
we plan to continue utilizing only one or a small number of suppliers for each of the components of our base station systems 
we have no long term contracts or arrangements with any of our suppliers that guarantee product availability or the continuation of particular payment or credit terms 
if  for any reason  a supplier fails to meet our quality and quantity requirements or stops selling products to us at commercially reasonable prices  we could experience significant production delays and cost increases  as well as higher warranty expenses and product image problems 
any of these problems could damage relationships with current or prospective customers  which could seriously harm our operating results in a given period and impair our ability to generate future sales 
from time to time  we must replace some of the components of our products when the supplier of that component is discontinuing production 
while we generally do not maintain an inventory of components  sometimes we do purchase an inventory of these discontinued components so that we can maintain production while finding new suppliers or developing substitute components ourselves 
we face the risk that we may deplete that inventory before finding an adequate substitute  and that could cause the loss of significant sales opportunities 
alternatively  we could purchase too many of the components and may be left with excess inventory on our hands 
we generally do not maintain an inventory of finished goods and many components have long lead times  with some taking to weeks from the time of entry of the order to delivery 
we cannot guarantee that alternative sources of supply can be arranged on short notice or that components will be available from alternative sources on satisfactory terms 
if we lose key personnel or are unable to hire additional qualified personnel  we may not be able to operate our business successfully 
our future success largely depends on our ability to attract and retain highly skilled hardware and software engineers  particularly call processing engineers and digital signal processing engineers 
if we cannot continue to attract and retain quality personnel  that failure would significantly limit our ability to compete and to grow our business 
our success also depends upon the continuing contributions of our key management  research  product development  sales and marketing and manufacturing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
except for an employment and severance agreement we have with glenn ehley  our ceo and president  and a noncompetition agreement that we have with terry williams  our cto  we do not have employment or noncompetition agreements with any of our key officers 
we also do not have key man life insurance policies covering any of our employees 
see part i  employees for discussion of potential impediments to retention of key personnel 
if we fail to manage our operations efficiently  our business and prospects could be seriously harmed 
the need to develop and offer our products and implement our business plan in a difficult market will significantly challenge our planning and management capabilities 
we may not be able to implement management information and control systems in an efficient and timely manner 
if we are unable to manage our operations efficiently  our business and prospects could be seriously harmed 
to manage our operations and personnel  we will need to improve financial and operational controls  as well as our reporting systems and procedures  install new management information systems  and train  motivate and manage our sales and marketing  engineering  technical  finance and customer support employees 
we have an agreement with motorola  inc to grant them rights  which could harm our business 
when motorola purchased million of our series b preferred stock in  we granted motorola the right to acquire a worldwide  nonexclusive  royalty free license under any two of our patents 
motorola is a large telecommunications and technology company with significant resources and could exercise this right at any time and begin using these licenses to compete against us 
with respect to any possible infringement of our respective digital base station patents  motorola has agreed with us not to enjoin the other and to attempt dispute resolution  including negotiation of nonexclusive license agreements in good faith  before resorting to litigation 
we expect the prices of our products to decline due to competitive pressures  and this decline could reduce our revenues and gross margins 
we anticipate that the prices of our products will decrease in the future due to competitive pricing pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions or other factors 
if we are unable to offset these factors by increasing our sales volumes  our revenues will decline 
in addition  to maintain our gross margins  we must develop and introduce new products and product enhancements  and we must continue to reduce the manufacturing costs of our products 
we cannot guarantee that we will be able to do these things successfully 
our failure to do so would cause our revenue and gross margins to decline  which could seriously harm our operating results and cause the price of our common stock to decline 
we may make future acquisitions that dilute our stockholders percentage ownership  cause us to incur debt or assume contingent liabilities and subject us to other risks 
we expect to review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that would complement our current products  expand the breadth of our markets  enhance our technical capabilities  help secure critical sources of supply or that may otherwise 
table of contents offer growth opportunities 
while we have no current agreements or negotiations underway  we may buy businesses  products or technologies in the future 
in the event of any future purchases  we could issue stock that would dilute our current stockholders percentage ownership  incur debt  or assume liabilities 
these purchases also involve numerous risks  including problems combining the purchased operations  technologies or products  unanticipated costs  diversion of management s attention from our core business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of purchased organizations 
our industry is subject to extensive government regulation that could cause significant delays and expense 
wireless telecommunications are subject to extensive regulation by the us and foreign governments 
if we fail to conform our products to regulatory requirements or experience any delays in obtaining regulatory approvals  we could lose sales 
moreover  in most cases  we only plan to qualify our products in a foreign country once we have a purchase order from a customer located there  and this practice may deter customers or contribute to delays in receiving or filling orders 
continuing regulatory compliance could be expensive and may require time consuming and costly modifications of our products 
any failure of domestic and international regulatory authorities to allocate suitable frequency spectrum could limit our growth opportunities and our future revenues 
because our products are highly complex and are deployed in complex networks  they may have errors or defects that we find only after deployment  which if not remedied could harm our business 
our products are highly complex  are designed to be deployed in complex networks and may contain undetected defects  errors or failures 
although our products are tested during manufacturing and prior to deployment  they can only be fully tested when deployed in commercial networks 
consequently  our customers may discover errors after the products have been deployed 
the occurrence of any defects  errors or failures could result in installation delays  product returns  diversion of our resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by our customers  increased insurance costs and other losses to us or to our customers or end users 
any of these occurrences could also result in the loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products  which would harm our business and adversely affect our operating results and financial condition 
directors and officers insurance may be difficult or cost prohibitive to obtain 
our current directors and officers insurance policy was difficult and expensive to obtain 
the policy will expire on december  it may be difficult and or it will be expensive to secure a replacement policy 
if we are unable to renew or secure a replacement policy  we could lose our officers and directors and it will be extremely difficult to recruit qualified replacements for our management team and board of directors  which would have a material adverse affect on our business 
control by our existing stockholders could discourage the potential acquisition of our business 
as of february   or greater stockholders and their affiliates owned million shares of our common stock or approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
in addition  three of these stockholders hold the rights to conversion of another million shares of common stock 
acting together  these stockholders would be able to control all matters requiring approval by stockholders  including the election of directors 
moreover  if tecore and scp ii invest  in the company  under the terms of the proposed financing as currently contemplated  the combined interests of the two investors will constitute a controlling interest in the company  with tecore holding a majority of the outstanding shares on a fully diluted basis assuming conversion of tecore s note 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our business or otherwise discouraging a potential acquirer from attempting to obtain control of us  which could prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have no derivative financial instruments or derivative commodity instruments in our cash and cash equivalents 
we invest the proceeds from our financing activities in interest bearing  investment grade securities that mature within months 
our transactions are generally conducted  and our accounts are denominated  in united states dollars 
accordingly  these funds were not exposed to significant foreign currency risk at december
