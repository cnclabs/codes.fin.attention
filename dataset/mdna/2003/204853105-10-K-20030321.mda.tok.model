industry background the demand for digital communications is growing the demand for digital information has accelerated the need for communications among multiple electronic devices and in various markets  including computers  telecommunications  networking  storage  consumer electronics and others  such as aerospace  automotive  industrial automation  medical instrumentation and robotics 
this growing demand centers on widespread  broadband transmissions of digital information  including internet access  data storage and rich media content 
communication among digital devices  or connectivity  occurs over a variety of physical media  such as copper wire and fiber optic cable  and wireless technologies with rapidly fluctuating frequencies 
computer technology initially provided connectivity only among internal devices  such as the processor  memory and storage  and with external peripheral devices  such as the keyboard  mouse and printer 
today  computer technology also enables connectivity among multiple computing devices and across networks  such as local area networks  wide area networks  storage area networks  home area networks  personal area networks and the internet 
telecommunications technology also currently enables connectivity among multiple devices  such as telephones  fax machines  pagers and personal digital assistants 
consumer electronics technology is progressively enabling connectivity among devices  such as internet appliances  digital cameras  audio systems and televisions 
communications standards are becoming increasingly complex digital devices communicate by sending electronic signals through a transmission channel according to a specified protocol 
a protocol is the set of detailed rules that governs both the channel and the device hardware and software  and regulates the manner in which the signals are sent 
the channel and the protocol are both typically specified in a formal communications standard 
for communication to be successful  each device must recognize and follow the same standard 
early communications standards were relatively simple  typically involving low speed communications between two simple devices connected directly by copper wire 
current standards are increasingly complex  typically involving high speed communications among multiple sophisticated devices indirectly linked to other devices and across various physical media  including copper wire and fiber optic cables  and wireless technologies with rapidly fluctuating frequencies 
as a result  standards that were expressed initially in only a few pages of text may now extend to over a thousand pages 
the specifications for these standards are broadly available  which facilitates interoperability of hardware and software products from different manufacturers 
a standard is typically introduced by several leading technology and infrastructure companies 
these core or promoter companies comprise the nucleus of independent communications standards groups  sometimes referred to as implementers forums  trade associations or special interest groups 
these groups assist in the development  implementation  promotion  and compliance with the standards 
as commercial interest in a standard increases  the communications standards group typically expands to include system and device manufacturers and service providers 
the promoter companies typically remain closely associated with the standard throughout its lifecycle 
a standard is implemented over a lifecycle that includes three overlapping phases development  production and market deployment 
the development phase covers the development and production of the semiconductors and software  including embedded software  protocol stacks and device drivers  that are the building blocks for products and applications 
during the production phase  system and device manufacturers apply these building blocks to construct their unique products and applications 
the market deployment phase covers the introduction and sale of products and applications in the market 
similarly  products associated with a particular standard follow their own unique lifecycle from development through production  deployment and operation

manufacturing we use outside contract manufacturing services for printed circuit board fabrication  assembly and testing 
we outsource the manufacture of our lower volume  higher margin products to several facilities located in the silicon valley area 
we conduct final assembly  testing and quality assurance at our facility in santa clara  california 
we outsource the turnkey manufacturing and assembly of our higher volume  lower margin products to several facilities located in asia 
this approach enables us to focus on our design strengths  reduce fixed costs and capital expenditures  and provide flexibility in meeting market demand 
we do not have long term contracts with any of our contract manufacturers 
we design and develop a number of the key components of our products  including our asic  printed circuit boards and mechanical packaging 
we also use detail inspection and thorough testing of each product to assure product quality and reliability 
although we use standard parts and components for our products where possible  we currently purchase a few key components used in the manufacture of our products from single or limited sources 
our principal single source component suppliers include agilent  altera  cypress semiconductor  ericsson  intel  lsi logic  smsc  and xilinx 
currently  purchase commitments with our single or limited source suppliers are on a purchase order basis 
any interruption or delay in the supply of any of these components  or the inability to procure these components from alternate sources at acceptable prices and within a reasonable time  would substantially harm our business 
in addition  qualifying additional suppliers could be time consuming and expensive and might increase the likelihood of errors 
competition our markets are highly competitive  and we expect competition to intensify in the future 
we believe that the principal factors of competition are product functionality  ease of product use  speed  stability and accuracy of products  flexibility and programmability of products  upgradability of products  local support and service for products  time to market with new products  breadth of product offerings  and price performance 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to each of these factors and have gained significant market share in some of our target markets as a result 
we believe our success has been driven by our vertically integrated technology  ability to generate customer loyalty and ability to anticipate market trends 
the markets for advanced verification and connectivity products for emerging communications standards are highly competitive 
we compete with multiple companies in various markets  including arca  frontline  mobiwave and tektronix  in the market for bluetooth wireless technology products  ancot  finisar and i tech in the market for fibre channel products  dap design and yokagawa in the market for ieee products  agilent and finisar in the market for infiniband products  agilent  catalyst and data transit corporation in the market for pci express products  ancot  innotech and i tech in the market for scsi products  data transit corporation in the market for serial ata products  and catalyst enterprises and data transit in the market for usb products 
in addition to these competitors  we may also face competition from other companies with new technologies or products based on emerging communications standards or large companies that may enter our target markets 
any of these or other potential competitors  as well as our existing competitors  may develop or acquire technologies that address our target markets more effectively and at a lower cost 
in addition  these competitors may enter into strategic alliances or business combinations that increase their ability to innovate and address our markets 
intellectual property we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect our intellectual property 
in addition  we have six patents pending 
however  we believe that factors such as the creativity and technological skills of our personnel  new product developments  frequent product enhancements  reliable customer service and product maintenance are essential to establishing and maintaining a technology leadership position 
many of our products contain elements that we consider proprietary  including the catc trace in our development products and the embedded software and software drivers in our connectivity products 
we cannot provide any assurance that other companies will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
despite our efforts to protect our intellectual property rights  existing laws and our contractual arrangements provide only limited protection 
unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent unauthorized use of our intellectual property  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
expensive litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce our intellectual property rights 
our failure to enforce and protect our intellectual property rights or any adverse change in the laws protecting intellectual property rights could harm our business 
we expect that we will be subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our markets grows and the functionality of products further overlaps 
from time to time  we may receive letters from third parties  including some of our competitors  alleging that our products infringe these parties patent or other intellectual property rights 
at present  we do not believe that our products infringe any other party s intellectual property rights 
if any claims cannot be resolved through a license or similar arrangement  we could become a party to litigation 
the results of any litigation are inherently uncertain 
in the event of an adverse result in any litigation with third parties that could arise in the future  we could be required to pay substantial damages  including treble damages if we are held to have willfully infringed  to cease the manufacture  use and sale of infringing products  to expend significant resources to develop noninfringing technology  or to obtain licenses to the infringing technology 
in addition  lawsuits  regardless of their success  would likely be time consuming and expensive to resolve and would divert management time and attention from our business 
we may become involved in legal proceedings against other parties  which may also cause other parties to assert claims against us 
we report material pending legal proceedings  if any  under the separate caption item legal proceedings elsewhere in this report 
employees as of december   we had employees 
of these individuals  were in sales and marketing  were in research and development  were in operations and were in finance and administration 
our employees are not represented by any collective bargaining unit  and we believe our relations with our employees are satisfactory 
item properties our principal executive and administrative offices are located in a leased facility consisting of approximately  square feet of office space in santa clara  california

all forward looking statements included in this form k are based on information available to us on the date of this report on form k  and we assume no obligation to update the forward looking statements  or to update the reasons why actual results could differ from those projected in the forward looking statements 
see risk factors below  as well as such other risks and uncertainties as are detailed in our securities and exchange commission reports and filings for a discussion of the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from the forward looking statements 
the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect the more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
we report our revenue and gross profit in three business segments development  production  and connectivity products 
due to the significant software content of our products  we recognize revenue in accordance with statement of position  or sop   software revenue recognition 
under sop  we recognize revenue to distributors  resellers and end users upon shipment provided that there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  the product has been delivered and title has passed  the fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
we do not provide distributors  resellers or end user customers price protection  or rights to return or exchange products 
generally  our distributors do not maintain inventory  however  they have the right to return inventory upon termination of their distribution agreement 
we review inventory levels held by distributors  if any  quarterly to ensure that any potential returns in the event of termination are not material 
when we have shipped products but some elements essential to the functionality of the products have not been completed  revenue and associated cost of revenue are deferred until all remaining elements have been delivered 
software maintenance support revenue is deferred and recognized ratably over the maintenance support period 
provisions for warranty costs are recorded at the time products are shipped 
our cash equivalents and short term investments are placed in portfolios managed by three professional money management firms under the investment guidelines we have established 
these guidelines address the critical objectives of preservation of principal  avoiding inappropriate concentrations  meeting liquidity requirements and delivering maximum after tax returns 
we classify all highly liquid investments purchased with an original maturity of days or less to be cash equivalents and those with a maturity greater than days but less than one year to be short term investments 
cash equivalents and short term investments consist principally of investments in commercial paper  investment quality corporate and municipal bonds  money market funds  collateralized mortgage obligations  and us government agency securities 
we account for income taxes under the liability method  which requires  among other things  that deferred income taxes be provided for temporary differences between the tax bases of our assets and liabilities and their financial statement reported amounts 
in addition  deferred tax assets are recorded for the future benefit of utilizing net operating losses and research and development credit carryforwards 
a full valuation allowance is provided against deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that they will be realized 
as of december   we have provided a full valuation allowance for our net deferred tax assets as we cannot predict that these amounts will be realized through taxable income from future operations  or by carryback to prior years taxable income 
our purchased intangible assets totaled  as of december  we are required to make judgments about the recoverability of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of these assets may not be recoverable 
in order to make such judgments  we are required to make assumptions about the value of these assets in the future including future prospects for earnings and cash flows of the businesses underlying these investments 
judgments and assumptions about the future are complex  subjective and can be affected by a variety of factors including industry and economic trends  our market position and the competitive environment in which we operate 
although we believe our judgments and assumptions are reasonable and appropriate  different judgments and assumptions could materially impact our reported financial results 
overview we are a provider of advanced verification systems and connectivity products for existing and emerging digital communications standards such as bluetooth wireless technology  ethernet  fibre channel  ieee  infiniband  pci express  scsi  serial ata and usb 
our products are used by semiconductor  device  system and software companies at each phase of their products lifecycles from development through production and market deployment 
our verification systems consist of development and production products that accurately monitor communications traffic and diagnose operational problems to ensure that products comply with standards and operate with other devices as well as to assist system manufacturers in downloading software onto new computers 
our connectivity products enable reliable  uninterrupted service for broadband internet access 
we currently outsource most of the manufacturing of our verification systems and connectivity products so that we may concentrate our resources on the design  development and marketing of our existing and new products 
we report our revenue and gross profit in three business segments development  production  and connectivity products 
in the year ended december   revenue from our development products was million  revenue from our production products was million and revenue from our connectivity products was  historically  we have generated a majority of our revenue across all segments from products for the usb standard 
revenue from usb products accounted for approximately of our revenue in the year ended december   of which was from usb products 
we sell our products to technology  infrastructure and application companies through our direct sales force and indirectly primarily through our distributors and manufacturer s representatives 
for the year ended december   toyo  our primary distributor in japan  accounted for of our revenues and lecoln technology co  our primary distributor in taiwan and china  accounted for of our revenues 
in the years ended december  and  toyo accounted for and of our revenues  respectively 
no other customer accounted for or more of our revenues during the periods presented herein 
historically  a substantial portion of our revenue has been derived from customers outside of the united states 
in the year ended december   of our revenue was derived from international customers  of which was derived from customers in japan  was derived from customers in other parts of asia  and was derived from customers in europe 
the increase in international revenue as a percentage of total revenue from in the year ended december  is primarily due to increased sales to asia  excluding japan  of approximately coupled with the general economic slowdown in the united states 
a significant portion of revenue from europe resulted from pent up demand associated with the release of certain infiniband products during the year 
we do not believe that this demand for these infiniband products will be sustainable at these levels in the future 
without the revenue from these products in europe in  our revenue in europe as percentage of our total revenue would have been substantially lower 
all of our revenue and accounts receivable are denominated in us dollars 
although seasonality affects many of our target markets  to date our revenues and financial condition as a whole have not been materially impacted by seasonality 
the development of emerging communications standards and technological change have influenced and are likely to continue to influence our quarterly and annual revenue and results of operations 
our product development and marketing strategies are focused on working closely with promoter companies and communications standards groups to gain early access to new communications standards and technologies 
we have invested significantly in the research  development and marketing of our products for emerging communications standards  often before these standards have gained widespread industry acceptance and in advance of generating substantial revenue related to these investments 
additionally  the rate and timing of customer orders may vary significantly from month to month 
accordingly  if sales of our products do not occur when we expect and we are unable to predict or adjust our estimates on a timely basis  our expenses may increase as a percentage of revenue 
the overall economic environment continues to create uncertainties for our customers and us 
we have experienced continuing weakness in each of our business segments over the last two years as a result of slowing growth in the global economy and delays in orders as a result of reduced spending by many of our customers 
during the second and fourth quarters of  we implemented separate restructuring plans designed to consolidate operations and reduce costs 
the restructuring plans included the closure of our facilities in san diego  california and netanya  israel and a reduction in staff by a total of positions 
obligations related to subleasing may continue until we incurred restructuring expenses of  for the quarter ended june  and  for the quarter ended december  on may   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with verisys and its shareholders pursuant to which we acquired verisys for million in stock and cash 
the transaction closed on june  and we accounted for the acquisition under the purchase method of accounting 
the accompanying consolidated condensed financial statements include the results of operations of verisys subsequent to june   the date that we designated as the acquisition date for accounting purposes 
verisys operated in aptos  california prior to moving all of its personnel and operations to our santa clara  california facility in january verisys was founded in and developed  manufactured and sold bus analysis tools for the scsi market 
verisys currently operates as our wholly owned subsidiary

our revenue was million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december   and million in the year ended december  these amounts represent a decrease of from to and a decrease of from to the decrease in revenue from and was due primarily to decreases in sales of certain existing development  production and connectivity products of million  million and million  respectively  offset by increases in sales of new development and production products  which represented million and million  respectively 
the decrease in sales of existing development and production products was primarily the result of the slowdown in the bluetooth and usb markets and the general economic slowdown 
the decrease in sales of connectivity products was primarily the result of additional competitive pressure due to improved availability of next generation cable and dsl modems with integrated usb support 
in january  we converted our resellers to manufacturer s representatives 
this conversion resulted in an estimated amount of additional revenue for the year ended december  of  as we sold directly to our end customers without discount 
however  this estimated additional revenue resulted in an increase in sales and marketing expense relating to manufacturer s representatives commissions 
the decrease in revenue from to was due primarily to decreases in our sales of certain development products  production products and connectivity products of million  million and million  respectively  offset by increases in sales of our new and certain other development products  which represented million 
the decrease in sales from existing development and production products was the result of a general economic slowdown  primarily in the united states  and the decrease in sales of connectivity products was primarily the result of softness in the broadband internet access market  and additional competitive pressure due to improved availability of next generation cable and dsl modems with integrated usb support

our gross profit was million in the year ended december   million in the year ended december   and million in the year ended december  these amounts represent a decrease of from to and a decrease of from to the dollar decrease in gross profit from and was primarily the result of a decrease in unit sales of development and connectivity products  approximately  of inventory write offs for obsolete inventory  and amortization of acquired developed technology of  offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  the dollar decrease in gross profit from to was primarily the result of a decrease in unit sales of development  production and connectivity products  offset by a decrease in amortization of deferred stock based compensation of  our gross margin percentage was in the year ended december   in the year ended december   and in the year ended december  the increase in gross margin percentage from to was primarily due to increases in development product sales as a percentage of revenue decreases in connectivity product sales as a percentage of revenue  offset by reduced margins for our production products resulting from higher costs associated with components and lower volume manufacturing of new products 
our higher margin business segment  development products  increased as a percentage of total revenue by  our lower margin business segment  production products  increased as a percentage of total revenue by and our lowest margin business segment  connectivity products  decreased as a percentage of total revenue by 
in january  we converted our resellers to manufacturer s representatives 
this change improved gross margins by for the year december   as we sold directly to our end customers without discount 
the decrease in gross margin from to was primarily due to reduced margins for our production products  due to higher costs associated with lower volume manufacturing  and for our connectivity products  due to competitive pricing pressure  partially offset by a change in the mix of our revenue by business segment 
our lower margin business segments  production products and connectivity products  decreased as a percentage of total revenue by and  respectively  and our higher margin business segment  development products  increased as a percentage of total revenue by

goodwill impairment 
in the quarter ended september   we recorded a goodwill impairment of million arising from our purchase of verisys 
as a result of the decline in the company s market valuation and reduced scsi sales  the company performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets as of september   in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible asset 
these tests were based upon an independent valuation performed by an outside valuation specialist that utilized a combination of income and market value approaches

if we are required to raise additional funds  we may not be able to do so on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  if we issue new securities  stockholders might experience dilution and the holders of the new securities might have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing stockholders

risk factors set forth below  elsewhere in this annual report  and in other documents we file with the sec are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements contained in this report 
the occurrence of any of the developments or risks identified below may make the occurrence of one or more of the other risk factors below more likely to occur 
we continue to face uncertainty relating to economic conditions affecting our customers 
we face uncertainty in the degree to which the current global economic slowdown will continue to negatively affect growth and capital spending by our existing and potential customers 
we continue to experience instances of customers delaying or deferring orders and longer lead times to close sales 
if global economic conditions do not improve  or if they worsen  our business  operating results and financial condition will continue to be adversely impacted 
our future operating results are unpredictable and are likely to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
if we fail to meet the expectations of securities analysts or investors  our stock price would likely decline significantly 
our quarterly and annual operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to fluctuate significantly in the future due to a number of factors  some of which are wholly or partially outside of our control 
several of these risks are described in the risk factors below 
accordingly  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
some of the factors that could cause our quarterly or annual operating results to fluctuate include the amount and timing of our operating expenses and capital expenditures  changes in the volume of our product sales and pricing concessions on volume sales  the timing  reduction  deferral or cancellation of customer orders or purchases  seasonality in some of our target markets  the effectiveness of our product cost reduction efforts  variability of our customers product lifecycles  shifts in our sales toward lower margin products  changes in the average selling prices of our products  and cancellations  changes or delays of deliveries to us by our manufacturers and suppliers 
if our operating results fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors  the trading price of our common stock would likely decline significantly 
we depend upon widespread market acceptance of our usb products  and our revenue will decline if the market does not continue to accept these products 
we derive a substantial majority of our revenue from sales of our usb products 
sales of our usb products accounted for approximately of our revenue in the year ended december  we expect that revenue from these products will continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenue for the foreseeable future 
if the market does not continue to accept our usb products  our revenue will decline significantly 
factors that may affect sales of our current usb products include the continued growth of markets for usb compliant devices  the performance and pricing of our usb products  and the availability  functionality and price of competing products 
companies must also modify their products to support new versions of usb  such as usb many of these factors are beyond our control 
in addition  in order to maintain widespread market acceptance  we must continue to differentiate ourselves from the competition through our technical expertise  product offerings and brand name recognition 
if we fail to keep up with rapid technological change and evolving industry standards  our products could become less competitive or obsolete 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements and evolving industry standards 
we may cease to be competitive if we fail to introduce new products or product enhancements that address these changes  meet new customer requirements and support new standards 
to continue to introduce new products or product enhancements on a timely basis  we must identify emerging technological trends in our target markets  including new communications standards  accurately define and design new products or product enhancements to meet market needs  develop or license the underlying core technologies necessary to create new products and product enhancements  and respond effectively to technological changes and product introductions by others 
if we are unable to identify  develop  manufacture  market or support new or enhanced products successfully or on a timely basis  our competitors could gain market share or our new products or product enhancements might not gain market acceptance 
further  we might not be able to respond effectively to product announcements by competitors  technological changes or emerging industry standards 
delays in the development of new products or product enhancements could harm our operating results and our competitive position 
the development of new  technologically advanced products is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation and highly skilled engineering and development personnel  as well as accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
although we have not previously experienced any material product development delays  delays could occur in the future 
to the extent we do not timely introduce a product for an emerging standard or customers defer or cancel orders expecting the release of a new product or product enhancement  our operating results could suffer 
product development delays may result from numerous factors  including changing product specifications and customer requirements  difficulties in hiring and retaining necessary technical personnel  difficulties in allocating engineering resources and overcoming resource limitations  difficulties with contract manufacturers or suppliers of key components  changing market or competitive product requirements  and unanticipated engineering complexities 
if we devote resources to developing products for emerging communications standards that ultimately are not widely accepted  our business could be harmed 
our future growth depends upon our ability to manufacture and sell in volume advanced verification systems and connectivity products for existing and emerging communications standards such as bluetooth wireless technology  ethernet  fibre channel  ieee  infiniband  pci express  scsi  serial ata and usb and for new communications standards that may be conceived of at some indeterminate time in the future 
we have little or no control over the conception  development or adoption of new communications standards 
moreover  even as it relates to currently emerging standards  the markets are rapidly evolving and we have virtually no ability to impact the adoption of those standards 
as a result  there is significant uncertainty as to whether markets for new and emerging standards ultimately will develop at all or  if they do develop  their potential size or future growth rate 
we may incur significant expenses and dedicate significant time and resources in developing products for new and emerging communications standards that fail to gain broad acceptance 
for example  we spent four years from to developing products for the access 
bus technology  a standard designed to connect peripheral devices to computers  which did not gain market acceptance 
the failure of a standard for which we devote resources to gain widespread acceptance would likely harm our business 
if we fail to maintain and expand our relationships with the core or promoter companies in our target markets  we may have difficulty developing and marketing our products 
it is important to our success to maintain and expand our relationships with companies that are leaders in developing emerging communications standards in our target markets 
we believe that we need to work closely with these companies to gain valuable insights into new product market demands  to obtain early access to emerging communications standards as they develop and to help us design new products 
we need to maintain our relationships with leading technology and infrastructure companies  as well as expand our relationships with leaders in new markets 
generally  we do not enter into formal contracts obligating these companies to work or share their technology with us 
industry leaders could choose to work with other companies in the future 
if we fail to maintain and expand our industry relationships  we could lose first mover advantage with respect to emerging standards and it would be more difficult for us to develop and market products that address these standards 
decreases in average selling prices of our products as a result of new product introductions  enhancements and competition may reduce gross margins and revenue 
we are experiencing increased competition and pricing pressures in our principal markets and  as we expand our product portfolio into other new and existing communications standards markets  we expect to experience similar competitive forces in those markets 
as a result  we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future in response to such things as product introductions or enhancements by us or our competitors  product discounting on volume purchase orders or additional pricing pressures 
we believe we will need to continue to develop and introduce on a timely basis new products that incorporate features that can be sold at higher average selling prices 
failure to do so would likely cause our revenue and gross margins to decline 
our executive officers  directors  philips semiconductors and certain entities affiliated with them own a large percentage of our voting stock  which could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control 
as of march   our executive officers  directors  philips semiconductors and certain entities affiliated with or beneficially controlled by them owned approximately  shares or approximately of the outstanding shares of our common stock 
these stockholders  acting together  can control matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election or removal of directors and the approval of mergers or other business combination transactions 
this concentration of ownership could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in our control or otherwise discouraging potential acquirers from attempting to obtain control  which in turn could have an adverse effect on the market price of our common stock or prevent our stockholders from realizing a premium over the market price for their shares of common stock 
our repurchase of shares of our common stock pursuant to our stock repurchase program discussed under the separate caption in part ii  item  note subsequent events  elsewhere in this report  may increase the control of these stockholders 
the interim status of our chief executive officer and the transition to his replacement may cause substantial organizational disruptions and inefficiencies 
in october  one of our co founders  dan wilnai  returned to assume day to day management of the company on an interim basis as our president and chief executive officer 
the future departure of mr 
wilnai and any transitions under a new president and ceo may cause significant operational disruptions and inefficiencies  the full impact of which we are currently unable to predict 
the loss of key management personnel  on whose knowledge  leadership and technical expertise we rely  would cause significant disruptions in our operations and harm our ability to execute our business plan 
our success depends heavily upon the continued contributions of our key management personnel  whose knowledge  leadership and technical expertise may be difficult to replace 
moreover  all of our personnel  including our executive staff  are employed on an at will basis 
we maintain no key person insurance on any of our personnel 
if we were to terminate or lose the services of any of our key personnel and were unable to hire qualified replacements  our ability to execute our business plan would be harmed 
even if we were able to hire qualified replacements  we would expect to experience operational disruptions and inefficiencies 
in addition  employees who leave our company may subsequently compete against us 
variations in our revenue may cause fluctuations in our operating results 
we may experience delays generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons 
historically  we have had little backlog and our revenue in any quarter has depended upon orders booked and shipped in that quarter 
furthermore  our customers may delay scheduled delivery dates and cancel orders without significant penalty 
in addition  even if we ship orders  generally accepted accounting principles may require us to defer recognition of revenue until a later date 
because we budget our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term  any delay in generating forecasted revenue could have a significant negative impact on our operating results 
shifts in our product mix may result in declines in gross margins 
our gross margins vary among our products  with our gross margins generally being higher on our advanced verification systems than on our connectivity products 
our overall gross margins might fluctuate from period to period as a result of shifts in product mix  the channels through which we sell our products  the introduction of new products and product costs 
continued competition in our markets may lead to a reduction in our prices  revenue and market share 
the markets for advanced verification and connectivity products for emerging communications standards are highly competitive 
we compete with multiple companies in various markets  including arca  frontline  mobiwave and tektronix in the market for bluetooth wireless technology products  ancot  finisar and i tech in the market for fibre channel products  dap design and yokagawa in the market for ieee products  agilent and finisar in the market for infiniband products  agilent  catalyst and data transit corporation in the market for pci express products  ancot  innotech and i tech in the market for scsi products  data transit corporation in the market for serial ata products  and catalyst enterprises and data transit in the market for usb products 
any of our competitors may develop technologies that address our targeted markets more effectively and at a lower cost 
in addition  these competitors may enter into strategic alliances or business combinations that increase their ability to innovate and address our markets 
we may also face competition from other equipment manufacturers  such as lecroy  national instruments and rhode schwartz 
many of these companies have substantially greater financial  technical  marketing and distribution resources and brand name recognition 
we expect more companies  including some of our customers  will enter our markets 
if these companies develop products that compete with our products or form alliances with or acquire companies offering competing products  even if those products do not have capabilities comparable to our products  they would be significant competitors and their activities could cause us to reduce our prices 
increased competition could result in significant price erosion  reduced revenue  lower margins and loss of market share  any of which would significantly harm our business 
we depend on contract manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing requirements and if these manufacturers fail to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products  our competitive position  reputation and business could be harmed 
we currently rely on four contract manufacturers for all of our manufacturing requirements except for the final assembly  testing and quality assurance on our lower volume  higher margin products 
we do not have long term contracts with any of these manufacturers 
as a result  our manufacturers could refuse to continue to manufacture all or some of our products or change the terms under which they manufacture our products 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from some of our manufacturers in the past  which in turn forced us to delay product shipments 
we may experience similar future delays or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of products  any of which could significantly harm our business 
our manufacturers may not be able to meet our future requirements for timely delivery of products of sufficient quality and quantity 
we intend to introduce new products and product enhancements regularly  which will require that we rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with those of our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
the inability of our manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products or the loss of any manufacturer would cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders while we obtain a replacement 
if we are unable to forecast our supply needs accurately  our costs may increase or we may not be able to ship products in a timely manner 
we purchase components used in the manufacture of our products from several key sources 
we depend on these sources to deliver necessary components in a timely manner based on twelve month rolling forecasts that we provide 
lead times for materials and components that we order vary significantly and depend on factors such as specific supplier requirements  contract terms and current market demand for particular components 
if we overestimate our component requirements  we may develop excess inventory  which would increase our costs 
if we underestimate our component requirements  we may not be able to timely fulfill customer orders 
we depend on sole source suppliers for several key components of our products  and we may lose sales if they fail to meet our needs 
we obtain some parts  components and packaging used in our products from sole sources of supply 
for example  we obtain field programmable gate array integrated circuits from altera and xilinx  asics from lsi logic through arrow electronics  inc  certain bluetooth components from ericsson  semiconductor devices from agilent  and micro controllers from intel  smsc and cypress semiconductor 
if suppliers are unable to meet our demand for sole source components at reasonable costs and if we are unable to obtain an alternative source or the price for an alternative source is prohibitive  our ability to maintain timely and cost effective production of our products would be harmed 
in addition  because we rely on purchase orders rather than long term contracts with our suppliers  including our sole source suppliers  we cannot predict with certainty our ability to obtain components in the long term 
if we are unable to obtain components or receive a smaller allocation of components than is necessary to meet demand  customers could choose to purchase competing products 
if our distributors and manufacturer s representatives do not actively sell our products  our product sales may decline 
historically  we have relied on both manufacturer s representatives to sell our products domestically and on distributors to sell our products internationally 
we sell a substantial portion of our products through our distributors and manufacturer s representatives  including toyo  our primary distributor in japan 
toyo accounted for approximately of our revenue in the year ended december  our distributors and manufacturer s representatives generally offer products from multiple manufacturers 
accordingly  there is a risk that these distributors and manufacturer s representatives may give higher priority to selling products from other suppliers and reduce their efforts to sell our products 
our distributors and manufacturer s representatives may not market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with effective sales  marketing and technical support 
our distributors may on occasion build inventories in anticipation of substantial growth in sales and  if growth does not occur as rapidly as anticipated  may decrease the quantity of products ordered from us in subsequent quarters 
a slowdown in orders from our distributors or manufacturer s representatives could reduce our revenue in any given quarter and give rise to fluctuations in our operating results 
in addition  our sales to our distributors are made on the basis of purchase orders rather than long term commitments 
the loss of any major distributor  the delay of significant orders from our distributors  or the failure of our distributors to timely pay for products purchased could result in decreased or deferred recognition of revenue 
if we are unable to expand our direct sales operations and our distributor and manufacturer s representatives channels or successfully manage our expanded sales organization  our ability to increase our revenue will be harmed 
we intend to continue our development and expansion of our direct sales organization in north america and our indirect distribution channels internationally 
managing our distribution channels has become more complex as we have expanded both our product lines and our geographic presence 
as a result  it has also become increasingly critical that we optimize our distribution channels around complementary products and users 
we may not be able to expand our direct sales organization or distribution channels successfully  manage them optimally  and the cost of any expansion may exceed the revenue generated 
if we are unable to retain and motivate our sales  marketing  engineering  operations and finance personnel  our operations will be impaired 
to be successful and maintain a high level of quality  we will need to retain and motivate highly skilled personnel 
if we are unable to retain a sufficient number of qualified employees  our operations may be impaired 
we may have even greater difficulty retaining employees if employees perceive the equity component of our compensation package to be less valuable as a result of market fluctuations in the price of our common stock 
if we fail to manage our operations effectively  our business could suffer 
our ability to offer products and implement our business plan successfully in a rapidly evolving market requires effective planning and management 
we implemented two separate corporate restructuring plans in the second quarter of and more recently in october  respectively 
some or all of the adopted measures in these restructures may not yield the intended results  if any  and may furthermore give rise to unforeseen complications and inefficiencies as we adjust personnel assignments 
moreover  reductions in force and cost cutting measures effected in both of these restructurings can adversely impact the morale of our personnel leading to further complications and operational inefficiencies 
if this were to occur  our profitability or financial position could be negatively impacted and our operating results could suffer 
our products may contain defects that cause us to incur significant costs  divert our attention from product development efforts and result in a loss of customers 
highly complex products such as our verification systems and connectivity products frequently contain defects when they are first introduced or as new versions are released 
although our products have not previously contained material defects  they may contain defects in the future 
if any of our products contain defects or have reliability  quality or compatibility problems  our reputation may be damaged and customers may be reluctant to buy our products 
as a result  our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers could be harmed 
in addition  these defects could interrupt or delay sales 
we may have to invest significant capital and other resources to alleviate these problems 
if any problem remains undiscovered until after we have commenced commercial production of a new product  we may be required to incur additional development costs and product recall  repair or replacement costs 
these problems may also result in claims against us by our customers or others 
in addition  these problems may divert our technical and other resources from other development efforts 
any acquisitions that we undertake could be difficult to integrate  disrupt our business  dilute stockholder value and harm our operating results 
we expect to continue to review opportunities to buy other businesses or technologies that complement our current products  expand our markets  enhance our technical capabilities or that might otherwise offer growth opportunities 
if we make any acquisitions  we could issue stock that would dilute the percentage ownership of our existing stockholders  incur substantial debt or assume contingent liabilities 
for example  we issued  shares of our company common stock in connection with our acquisition of verisys in june in addition  in the quarter ended september   we recorded a goodwill impairment of million  and a partial impairment write down of  of purchased intangibles  arising from our purchase of verisys 
in addition  the verisys acquisition and other potential acquisitions involve numerous risks  including problems in assimilating the purchased operations  technologies or products  costs or accounting charges associated with the acquisition  diversion of management s attention from our existing business  adverse effects on existing business relationships with suppliers and customers  risks associated with entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of purchased businesses 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect sales 
because we sell our products worldwide  our business is subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we recognized of our revenue from sales to international customers in the year ended december  we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our revenue 
in addition  several of our manufacturers facilities and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a specific country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in emerging markets  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  potentially negative consequences from changes in tax laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor regulations  war or other international conflicts  differing protection of intellectual property  and unexpected changes in regulatory requirements 
geopolitical instability and the threat of terrorist attacks have created many economic and political uncertainties  some of which may harm our business  prospects and our ability to conduct business generally 
geopolitical instability and the continued threat of terrorism and the resulting military  economic and political responses including  without limitation  war between sovereign nations as well as heightened security measures may cause significant disruption to commerce worldwide 
to the extent any disruption results in a general decrease or delay in our customers spending  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are unable to predict whether the threat of such instability and terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long term commercial disruptions or have long term adverse effects on our business  results of operations or financial condition 
our headquarters and our contract manufacturers are located in northern california  asia and other areas where natural disasters may occur 
currently  our corporate headquarters and some of our contract manufacturers are located in northern california and our other contract manufacturers are located in asia 
northern california and asia historically have been vulnerable to natural disasters and other risks  such as earthquakes  fires  floods  power loss and telecommunications failure  which at times have disrupted the local economy and posed physical risks to our and our manufacturers properties 
we do not have redundant  multiple site capacity in the event of a natural disaster 
any failure to protect our intellectual property adequately may significantly harm our business 
we protect our proprietary processes  software  know how and other intellectual property and related rights through copyrights  trademarks and the maintenance of trade secrets  including entering into confidentiality agreements 
our success and ability to compete depend in part on our proprietary technology 
we currently do not have any registered patents 
although we have six patents pending  patents may not issue as a result of these or other patent applications 
any patents that ultimately issue may be successfully challenged or invalidated  or may not provide us with a significant competitive advantage 
third parties may breach confidentiality agreements or other protective contracts with us and we may not be able to enforce our rights in the event of these breaches 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights  including pursuing remedies in court 
we may become involved in legal proceedings against other parties  which may also cause other parties to assert claims against us 
we report material pending legal proceedings  if any  under the separate caption part i  item legal proceedings elsewhere in this report 
in the future we may not be able to detect infringements and may lose competitive position in our markets before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technologies or develop competing technologies 
the laws of other countries in which we market our products might offer little or no effective protection of our proprietary technology 
reverse engineering  unauthorized copying or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without payment  which could significantly harm our business 
claims that we infringe third party intellectual property rights could result in significant expenses or restrictions on our ability to sell our products 
our industry is characterized by uncertain and conflicting intellectual property claims and frequent litigation  especially regarding patent rights 
we cannot be certain that our products do not and will not infringe issued patents or the intellectual property rights of others 
historically  patent applications in the united states have not been publicly disclosed until the patent is issued  and we may not be aware of filed patent applications that relate to our products or technology 
if patents are later issued in connection with these applications  we may be liable for infringement 
periodically  other parties may assert patent  copyright and other rights to technologies in various jurisdictions that are important to our business 
any claims asserting that our products infringe or may infringe the rights of third parties  including claims arising through our contractual indemnification of our customers  regardless of their merit or resolution  would likely be costly and time consuming  divert the efforts of our technical and management personnel  cause product shipment delays or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
royalty or licensing agreements  if required  may not be available on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
changes in current laws or regulations or the imposition of new laws or regulations could impede the sale of our products 
we and many of our customers and their products are subject to regulations and standards set by the federal communications commission  or fcc 
internationally  many of our customers and their products may also be required to comply with regulations established by authorities in various countries 
we are required to determine to what extent our products may be subject to fcc standards and regulations and to what extent we are required to obtain authorizations from the fcc directly or from a third party authorized by the fcc to issue such authorizations 
we are also required to maintain in good standing any equipment authorization we receive from the fcc or an fcc approved party 
in addition  the regulations in force both in the united states and in foreign jurisdictions may change 
failure to comply with regulations established by regulatory authorities or to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certificates could significantly harm our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the after tax income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities in which we invest may be subject to market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with an interest rate fixed at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
since december   cash equivalents and short term investments consist principally of investments in commercial paper  investment quality corporate and municipal bonds  money market funds  collateralized mortgage obligations  and us government agency securities  we believe there is no material market risk exposure
