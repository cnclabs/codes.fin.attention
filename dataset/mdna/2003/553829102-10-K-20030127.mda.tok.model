overview the fund is a non diversified investment company that is regulated as a business development company under the investment company act 
the fund provides equity and debt financing to privately held venture capital backed information technology companies 
the primary investment objective is to achieve long term capital appreciation in the value of its investments 
historically the fund s investing activities have focused on private equity securities 
generally  private equity investments are structured as preferred stock 
generally portfolio companies do not pay dividends and consequently current income is not a significant part of the equity portfolio 
private equity investments typically range from million to million and the fund generally expects these investments to achieve liquidity within three to five years 
typically a cash return on the investment is not received until a liquidity event occurs 
on september  the fund announced a new strategic initiative to enhance shareholder value by investing its capital in debt securities by providing debt financing to late stage venture capital backed information technology companies 
by investing in debt securities  the fund will seek to obtain current interest income from these financings  as well as seek long term capital growth through the appreciation in the value of warrants or other equity instruments that it will receive in connection with making the loan 
we expect our loans typically will range from million to million  mature in no more than five years and accrue interest at a fixed or variable rate that exceeds the prime rate 
our loans generally will be collateralized by a security interest in the borrower s assets 
interest payments will be due monthly or quarterly with amortization of the principal generally being deferred for a period of time usually one year 
we anticipate receiving warrants and an origination fee in consideration for making the loan 
we had not funded any debt financing under this initiative as of the end of our most recently completed fiscal year  but anticipate it becoming a significant part of our business in the future 
general investment climate during the reporting year  we continued to encounter a challenging investment climate characterized by reduced m a activity and public markets that were all but closed to new technology issues 
moreover  concerns regarding geo political risk and corporate profitability led to continued declines in both the public and private equity markets 
our cautious investment pace  as reflected in the new investments made throughout the fund s fiscal year  is indicative of our concern over the uncertainty in the market  limited exit opportunities  and what we perceived to be a general overvaluation of private equity deals during the period 
recent data from venture economics indicates that the amount of venture money being deployed is at pre levels  demonstrating that venture capitalists by and large continue to stay on the sidelines 
the fund s investment pace was similarly reduced as we focused our efforts on ensuring the continued financial well being of our portfolio companies 
toward that end  we have worked extensively with our companies to help them manage cash burn through restructurings and cost reductions 
our strategy from a portfolio management perspective has been to concentrate on the companies that we feel are the most capable of emerging strongly from the downturn and  where possible  increase our ownership stake in those companies 
with respect to new investments  we took a defensive posture over the last year as valuations in the private equity market continued to decline 
we intend to maintain extreme selectivity when considering new opportunities  seeking to ensure that prospective companies are appropriately valued and well equipped to face the current challenging operating conditions 
that being said  we believe it is a good time to make strategic investments in private equity since valuations have become more attractive as we near the bottom of a venture cycle 
it is our opinion that the fund is well positioned to take advantage of this situation  especially given our significant cash position 
nevertheless  tough economic conditions and inactive capital markets meant that we had to continue to write down the carrying value for a number of our investments during the reporting period 
furthermore  unhealthy ipo and m a markets have limited exit opportunities making it difficult for venture capitalists to realize gains on investments 
it is for this reason that we view our recent addition of a venture debt strategy as an appropriate complement to the equity portion of the portfolio 
venture lending can generate interest income  which in turn can help bridge the gap of increased liquidity time horizons for venture equity investments 
looking ahead  we are optimistic that the economy and market are demonstrating signs of recovery 
the fact that the us economy experienced increased growth in gdp during the reporting period is encouraging  especially given the dramatic blow we were dealt on september of last year 
we were particularly pleased that the m a market saw some resurgence towards the end of the reporting period 
with the addition of our new venture debt strategy and a substantial cash position to invest  we are confident that the fund should be poised to benefit from an opportunistic investment climate and improving market
