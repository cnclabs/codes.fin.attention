sales of our homes typically are made pursuant to a standard sales contract and provides the customer with a statutorily mandated right of rescission for a period ranging up to days after execution 
this contract requires a nominal customer deposit at the time of signing 
in addition  in the northeast region and metro d

we typically obtain an additional to down payment due to days after signing 
the contract may include a financing contingency  which permits the customer to cancel his obligation in the event mortgage financing at prevailing interest rates including financing arranged or provided by us is unobtainable within the period specified in the contract 
this contingency period typically is four to eight weeks following the date of execution 
residential land inventory it is our objective to control a supply of land  primarily through options  consistent with anticipated homebuilding requirements in each of our housing markets 
controlled land as of october   exclusive of communities under development described under business and properties residential development activities  is summarized in the following table 
the proposed developable lots in communities under development are included in the  total home lots under the total residential real estate chart in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

in our northeast region  our objective is to control a supply of land sufficient to meet anticipated building requirements for at least three to five years 
we typically option parcels of unimproved land for development 
in north carolina  metro dc  and the mid south  a portion of the land we acquired was from land developers on a lot takedown basis 
in texas  we primarily acquire improved lots from land developers 
under a typical agreement with the lot developer  we purchase a minimal number of lots 
the balance of the lots to be purchased are covered under an option agreement or a non recourse purchase agreement 
due to the dwindling supply of improved lots in these markets  we are currently optioning parcels of unimproved land for development 
in california  where possible  we plan to option developed or partially developed lots 
with a limited supply of developed lots in california  we are also optioning parcels of unimproved land for development 
customer financing at our communities  on site personnel facilitate sales by offering to arrange financing for prospective customers through our mortgage subsidiaries 
we believe that the ability to offer financing to customers on competitive terms as a part of the sales process is an important factor in completing sales 
our business consists of providing our customers with competitive financing and coordinating and expediting the loan origination transaction through the steps of loan application  loan approval and closing 
we originate loans in new jersey  new york  pennsylvania  maryland  virginia  north carolina  texas  and california 
during the year ended october   approximately of our homebuyers paid in cash and of our non cash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by one of our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries or our mortgage joint venture in california 
like other mortgage bankers  we customarily sell nearly all of the loans that we originate 
additionally  we sell virtually all of the loan servicing rights to loans we originate 
loans are sold either individually or in pools to gnma  fnma  or fhlmc or against forward commitments to institutional investors  including banks  mortgage banking firms  and savings and loan associations 
competition our residential business is highly competitive 
we are among the top ten homebuilders in the united states in both homebuilding revenues and home deliveries 
we compete with numerous real estate developers in each of the geographic areas in which we operate 
our competition range from small local builders to larger regional and national builders and developers  some of which have greater sales and financial resources than us 
previously owned homes and the availability of rental housing provide additional competition 
we compete primarily on the basis of reputation  price  location  design  quality  service and amenities 
regulation and environmental matters general 
we are subject to various local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning zoning  building design  construction and similar matters  including local regulations which impose restrictive zoning and density requirements in order to limit the number of homes that can eventually be built within the boundaries of a particular locality 
in addition  we are subject to registration and filing requirements in connection with the construction  advertisement and sale of our communities in certain states and localities in which we operate even if all necessary government approvals have been obtained 
we may also be subject to periodic delays or may be precluded entirely from developing communities due to building moratoriums that could be implemented in the future in the states in which we operate 
generally  such moratoriums relate to insufficient water or sewerage facilities or inadequate road capacity 
environmental 
we are also subject to a variety of local  state and federal statutes  ordinances  rules and regulations concerning protection of health and the environment environmental laws 
the particular environmental laws which apply to any given community vary greatly according to the community site  the site s environmental conditions and the present and former uses of the site 
these environmental laws may result in delays  may cause us to incur substantial compliance and other costs  and prohibit or severely restrict development in certain environmentally sensitive regions or areas 
new jersey fair housing act 
in july  new jersey adopted the fair housing act which established an administrative agency to adopt criteria by which municipalities will determine and provide for their fair share of low and moderate income housing 
this agency adopted such criteria in may its implementation thus far has caused some delay in approvals for some of our new jersey communities and may result in a reduction in the number of homes planned for some properties 
both prior to the enactment of the fair housing act and in its implementation thus far  municipal approvals in some of the new jersey municipalities in which we own land or land options required us to set aside up to of the approved homes for sale at prices affordable to persons of low and moderate income 
in order to comply with such requirements  we must sell these homes at a loss 
we attempt to reduce some of these losses through increased density  certain cost saving construction measures and reduced land prices from the sellers of property 
such losses are absorbed by the market priced homes in the same developments 
new jersey state planning act 
pursuant to the state planning act  the new jersey state planning commission has adopted a state development and redevelopment plan state plan 
the state plan  if fully implemented  would designate large portions of the state as unavailable for development or as available for development only at low densities  and other portions of the state for more intense development 
state government agencies would be required to make permitting decisions in accordance with the state plan  if it is fully implemented 
the state government agencies have adopted some policies and regulations to implement the state plan 
the governor has issued an executive order to all state agencies requiring compliance with the state plan 
it is unclear what effect this executive order may have on our ability to develop our land 
the california environmental quality act ceqa requires that every community comply with the ceqa 
compliance with ceqa may result in delay in obtaining the necessary approvals for commencement of the community  a reduction in the density permitted in the community  additional costs in developing the community  or denial of the permits necessary to construct the community 
conclusion 
despite our past ability to obtain necessary permits and approvals for our communities  it can be anticipated that increasingly stringent requirements will be imposed on developers and homebuilders in the future 
although we cannot predict the effect of these requirements  they could result in time consuming and expensive compliance programs and substantial expenditures for pollution and water quality control  which could have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  the continued effectiveness of permits already granted or approvals already obtained is dependent upon many factors  some of which are beyond our control  such as changes in policies  rules and regulations and their interpretation and application 
company offices 
we own our corporate headquarters  a four story   square feet office building located in red bank  new jersey and  square feet in a middletown  new jersey condominium office building

item legal proceedings we are involved from time to time in litigation arising in the ordinary course of business  none of which is expected to have a material adverse effect on us 
recently the general liability insurance market for homebuilding companies and their suppliers and subcontractors has become very difficult 
the availability of general liability insurance has been limited due to a decreased number of insurance companies willing to write for the industry 
in addition  those few insurers willing to write liability insurance have significantly increased the premium costs 
the company has been able to obtain general liability insurance but at higher premium costs with higher deductibles 
the company has been advised that a significant number of its subcontractors and suppliers have also had difficulty obtaining insurance that also provides coverage to the company 
while no assurance can be given  the company believes that it will be able to continue to obtain coverage but at higher total costs

business combinations 
under sfas no 
for acquisitions subsequent to june  and apb for acquisitions prior to june  we record as our cost the estimated fair value of the acquired assets less liabilities assumed 
any difference between the cost of an acquired company and the sum of the fair values of tangible and identified intangible assets less liabilities is recorded as goodwill 
the reported income of an acquired company includes the operations of the acquired company from the date of acquisition 
income recognition from home and land sales income from home sales is recorded when each home is closed  title is conveyed to the buyer  adequate cash payment has been received and there is no continued involvement 
income recognition from mortgage loans profits and losses relating to the sale of mortgage loans are recognized when legal control pass to the buyer and the sales price is collected 
inventories for inventories of communities under development  a loss is recorded when events and circumstances indicate impairment and the undiscounted future cash flows generated are less than the related carrying amounts 
the impairment loss is based on expected revenue  cost to complete including interest  and selling costs 
inventories and long lived assets held for sale are recorded at the lower of cost or fair value less selling costs 
fair value is defined in the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of or disposal of long lived assets as the amount at which an asset could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties  that is  other than in a forced or liquidation sale 
sfas no 
provides accounting guidance for financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
construction costs are accumulated during the period of construction and charged to cost of sales under specific identification methods 
land  land development  and common facility costs are allocated based on buildable acres to product types within each community  then amortized equally based upon the number of homes to be constructed in the community 
self insurance reserves we are self insured for our worker s compensation and general liability insurance 
reserves have been established based upon actuarial analysis of estimated future losses 
interest costs related to properties under development are capitalized during the land development and home construction period and expensed along with the associated cost of sales as the related inventories are sold 
land options costs are capitalized when incurred and either included as part of the purchase price when the land is acquired or charged to operations when we determine we will not exercise the option 
options that include specific performance terms  which have been triggered  are recorded on the balance sheet as inventory and other liabilities 
intangible assets the intangible assets recorded on our balance sheet are goodwill and a tradename which is an indefinite life intangible asset resulting from company acquisitions 
in accordance with the financial accounting standards no 
sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  we no longer amortize goodwill or indefinite life intangibles  but instead assess them periodically for impairment 
we performed such assessments utilizing a fair value approach as of october   and determined that no impairment of intangibles existed 
post development completion costs in those instances where a development is substantially completed and sold and we have additional construction work to be incurred  an estimated liability is provided to cover the cost of such work and is recorded in accounts payable and other liabilities in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets 
capital resources and liquidity our cash uses during the twelve months ended october  were for operating expenses  seasonal increases in housing inventories  construction  income taxes  interest  the repurchase of common stock  the redemption of subordinated indebtedness  the acquisition of the california operations of the forecast group  lp forecast  and the acquisition of a land portfolio from another homebuilding company 
we provided for our cash requirements from housing and land sales  the revolving credit facility  the issuance of a term loan  the issuance of  senior subordinated notes  the issuance of  senior notes  financial service revenues  and other revenues 
we believe that these sources of cash are sufficient to finance our working capital requirements  acquisitions  and other needs 
at october  we had approximately million of excess cash 
management anticipates using the excess cash to grow existing operations and fund future acquisitions 
our net income historically does not approximate cash flow from operating activities 
the difference between net income and cash flow from operating activities is primarily caused by changes in receivables  prepaid and other assets  interest and other accrued liabilities  accounts payable  inventory levels  mortgage loans and liabilities  and non cash charges relating to depreciation  the writeoff of sap costs  and impairment losses 
in and  a portion of the difference was also due to goodwill amortization 
when we are expanding our operations  which was the case in fiscal and  inventory levels increase causing cash flow from operating activities to decrease 
liabilities also increase as inventory levels increase 
the difference between net income and net operating cash flow is our increased efforts to accelerate the cash collection process from closing agents and increases in tax and other liabilities due to a significant increase in business 
the increase in liabilities partially offsets the negative effect on cash flow from operations caused by the increase in inventory levels 
as our mortgage warehouse loan asset increases  cash flow from operations decrease 
conversely  as such loans decrease  cash flow from operations increase 
depreciation and impairment losses always increase cash flow from operating activities since they are non cash charges to operations 
on december   our stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock expired 
as of december    shares had been purchased under this program 
on july   our board of directors authorized a revision to our stock repurchase program to purchase up to million shares of class a common stock 
as of october    shares have been purchased under this program  of which  were repurchased during the twelve months ended october  our homebuilding bank borrowings are made pursuant to an unsecured revolving credit agreement the agreement that provides a revolving credit line and letter of credit line of up to  through july interest is payable monthly and at various rates of either the prime rate plus 
or libor plus 
we believe that we will be able either to extend the agreement beyond july or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility 
we currently are in compliance and intend to maintain compliance with the covenants under the agreement 
as of october   there were no borrowings under the agreement 
on march   we issued  senior notes due and  senior subordinated notes due on april   we used a portion of the proceeds to redeem our subordinated notes due which had a balance of approximately  the early retirement of these notes resulted in an extraordinary loss of  net of an income tax benefit of  other senior indebtedness issued by us and outstanding as of october  was  senior notes due and  senior notes due on january  we issued a  term loan to a group of banks which is due january  interest is payable monthly at either the prime rate plus or libor plus 
the proceeds from the issuance of the term loan were primarily used to partially fund the acquisition of the california operations of forecast 
as of october  borrowings under the term loan were  our mortgage banking subsidiary borrows up to  under a bank warehousing arrangement that expires in june interest is payable monthly at the federal funds rate plus 
we believe that we will be able either to extend this agreement beyond june or negotiate a replacement facility  but there can be no assurance of such extension or replacement facility 
as of october  borrowings under the agreement were  total inventory increased  during the twelve months ended october  the increase in inventory was primarily due to the acquisition of the forecast group  lp forecast and the purchase of a land portfolio from a builder in our northeast region 
in addition  inventory levels increased slightly in most of our housing markets except in the mid south where we have liquidated our operations and in north carolina where the market has slowed down 
substantially all homes under construction or completed and included in inventory at october  are expected to be closed during the next twelve months 
most inventory completed or under development is financed through our line of credit  senior and subordinated indebtedness  and cash flows generated from operations 
we usually option property for development prior to acquisition 
by optioning property  we are only subject to the loss of a small option fee and predevelopment costs if we choose not to exercise the option 
as a result  our commitment for major land acquisitions is reduced

see notes to consolidated financial statements note for additional explanation 
these write downs and write offs were incurred primarily because of lower property values  a change in the marketing strategy to liquidate a particular property  or the decision not to exercise certain options to purchase land 
during the years ended october    and  we wrote off residential land options including approval and engineering costs amounting to   and million  respectively  which are included in the total write offs mentioned above 
we did not exercise those options because the communities proforma profitability did not produce adequate returns on investment commensurate with the risk 
those communities were located in new jersey  new york  metro d 
c  north carolina  california  and poland 
the write down of residential inventory during the year ended october  was attributed to poland and the mid south 
the write down in poland was based upon changes in market conditions 
in the mid south  land was written down based on a purchase offer 
we have made a decision to discontinue selling homes in these two markets and offer the remaining lots for sale 
the result of the above decisions was a reduction in inventory carrying amounts to fair value  resulting in a million impairment loss 
during the year ended october   we wrote down two residential communities in the northeast region  one community in north carolina  and two land parcels in florida 
the write down in the northeast region was attributed to two communities that were part of a large land acquisition  which resulted in a loss 
the write downs in north carolina and florida were based upon changes in market conditions 
the result of the above decisions was a reduction in inventory carrying amounts to fair value  resulting in a million impairment loss 
cost of sales includes expenses for housing and land and lot sales

as a result  depending on the mix of both the communities and of home types delivered  consolidated gross margin will fluctuate up or down 
we achieved higher gross margins during the year ended october  compared to the same period last year 
the consolidated gross margin percentage increased from the previous year primarily due to higher sales prices and increased national contract rebates  which slightly lowered our housing costs 
gross margins for the year ended october  increased in our metro d 
c 
market  california market  excluding forecast communities  and in our highest margin market  the northeast region 
during the year ended october   our gross margin percentage decreased from the previous year 
this decrease was due to the washington homes  inc merger  which significantly increased our activity in metro d 
c 
and north carolina and added markets in the mid south region that collectively have a lower average sales price and gross margin than the averages for our other markets 
on an individual market basis all of our markets showed an increase in gross margin percentage primarily resulting from increased sales prices for the years ended october    and the dollar increases in gross margin for each of the three years ended october    and were attributed to increased sales  primarily resulting from the acquisition of forecast homes in and the merger with washington homes in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of homebuilding revenues decreased to for the year ended october  and decreased to for the year ended october  from for the year ended october  such expenses increased to million for the year ended october  and increased to million for the year ended october  from million for the previous year 
the percentage decline for the years ended october  and was due to increased deliveries 
the increased spending year over year was primarily due to the acquisition of the forecast group in fiscal year and washington homes in fiscal year land sales and other revenues land sales and other revenues consist primarily of land and lot sales 
a breakout of land and lot sales is set forth below year ended october october october in thousands land and lot sales    cost of sales    land and lot sales gross margin   land and lot sales are incidental to our residential housing operations and are expected to continue in the future but may significantly fluctuate up or down

during the years ended october  and october   financial services provided a and million pretax profit  respectively 
during the year ended october   financial services resulted in a million loss before income taxes 
the increases in and were primarily due to a change in management  reduced costs  increased mortgage loan amounts  and the addition of mortgage operations from the merger with washington homes for a full year and the acquisition of forecast homes 
in addition to our wholly owned mortgage subsidiaries  customers obtained mortgages from our mortgage joint venture in our texas division in and  respectively  and our forecast division in in the market areas served by our wholly owned mortgage banking subsidiaries  approximately   and of our non cash homebuyers obtained mortgages originated by these subsidiaries during the years ended october    and  respectively

corporate general and administrative corporate general and administrative expenses include the operations at our headquarters in red bank  new jersey 
such expenses include our executive offices  information services  human resources  corporate accounting  training  treasury  process redesign  internal audit  construction services  and administration of insurance  quality  and safety 
as a percentage of total revenues  such expenses were   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
the percentage decrease during the years ended october  and was due to increased housing revenues 
our long term improvement initiatives included total quality  process redesign  which included the implementation of a software system net of capitalized expenses  and training 
such initiatives resulted in additional expenses for the years ended october    and which were not capitalized amounting to million  million  and million  respectively 
during the year ended october  we wrote off million of unamortized  capitalized costs associated with these initiatives

interest expense is broken down as follows year ended october october october in thousands sale of homes    land and lot sales  total    housing interest as a percentage of sale of home revenues amounted to   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
the decreases are primarily the result of increased equity and quicker inventory turnover 
inventory turnover is up as a result of the acquisition of forecast homes and the merger with washington homes where a larger portion of their purchases are finished lots requiring shorter holding periods until homes are delivered 
other operations other operations consist primarily of miscellaneous residential housing operations expenses  senior residential property operations  amortization of senior and senior subordinated note issuance expenses  earnout payments from homebuilding company acquisitions  amortization of the forecast consultant s agreement and the right of first refusal agreement  expenses related to exiting our mid south market  minority interest relating to joint ventures  corporate owned life insurance loan interest  and contributions 
for the year ended october   other operations increased primarily due to the amortization of the forecast consulting and right of first refusal agreements starting in  increased amortization of senior and subordinated note issuance expenses  and an increase in minority interest due to a new joint venture in our northeast region 
restructuring charges restructuring charges are estimated expenses associated with the merger of our operations with those of washington homes  inc as a result of the merger on january  under our merger plan  administration offices in maryland  virginia  and north carolina were either closed  relocated  or combined 
the merger of administration offices was completed by july  at january   expenses were accrued for salaries  severance and outplacement costs for the involuntary termination of associates  costs to close and or relocate existing administrative offices  and lost rent and leasehold improvements 
during the year ended october  our estimate for restructuring charges was increased to a total of million 
we have provided for the termination of associates

total taxes total taxes as a percentage of income before taxes amounted to approximately   and for the years ended october    and  respectively 
the decrease in this percentage from to is primarily attributed to a decrease in the effective federal income tax rate 
this decreased federal effective rate is due primarily to a reserve set up in for potential adjustments 
deferred federal and state income tax assets primarily represent the deferred tax benefits arising from temporary differences between book and tax income which will be recognized in future years as an offset against future taxable income 
if for some reason the combination of future years income or loss combined with the reversal of the timing differences results in a loss  such losses can be carried back to prior years to recover the deferred tax assets 
as a result  management is confident such deferred tax assets reflected in the balance sheet are recoverable regardless of future income 
see notes to consolidated financial statements note for an additional explanation of taxes 
extraordinary loss on april   we redeemed our subordinated notes due the early retirement of these notes resulted in an extraordinary loss of  net of income taxes of  inflation inflation has a long term effect on us because increasing costs of land  materials  and labor result in increasing sale prices of our homes 
in general  these price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in our housing markets and have not had a significant adverse effect on the sale of our homes 
a significant risk faced by the housing industry generally is that rising house costs  including land and interest costs  will substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers 
in recent years  in the price ranges in which our homes sell  we have not found this risk to be a significant problem 
inflation has a lesser short term effect on us because we generally negotiate fixed price contracts with our subcontractors and material suppliers for the construction of our homes 
these prices usually are applicable for a specified number of residential buildings or for a time period of between four to twelve months 
construction costs for residential buildings represent approximately of our homebuilding cost of sales
