item legal proceedings 
various lawsuits  claims and proceedings are pending against the company and certain of its subsidiaries 
the most significant of these are described below 
taxol litigation in and  the company filed several lawsuits asserting that a number of generic drug companies infringed its patents covering methods of administering paclitaxel when they filed abbreviated new drug applications seeking regulatory approval to sell paclitaxel 
these actions were consolidated for discovery in the us district court for the district of new jersey district court 
the company did not assert a monetary claim against any of the defendants  but sought to prevent the defendants from marketing paclitaxel in a manner that violates its patents 
the defendants asserted that they did not infringe the company s patents and that these patents are invalid and unenforceable 
in early  the district court invalidated most claims of the company s patents at issue 
on april   the us court of appeals for the federal circuit affirmed the district court s summary judgment of the invalidity of all but two claims of the patents at issue 
those two claims relate to the low dose  three hour administration of paclitaxel in which the patient is given a specified regimen of premedicants before the administration of paclitaxel 
the appellate court remanded those two claims to the district court for further proceedings 
in  the company filed an additional patent infringement suit against another company seeking to market generic paclitaxel 
in september  one of the defendants received final approval from the us food and drug administration fda for its abbreviated new drug application for paclitaxel and is marketing the product 
the fda has since announced additional final approvals and sales of additional generic products have begun 
some of the defendants asserted counterclaims seeking damages for alleged antitrust and unfair competition violations 
the company believed its patents were valid when it filed the suits  and the counterclaims asserted are believed to be without merit 
the lawsuits with all defendants who asserted counterclaims have been settled  with the defendants agreeing to drop all claims relating to paclitaxel and the company granting licenses to them under certain paclitaxel patent rights 
since the filing of the initial patent infringement suits  six private actions have been filed by parties alleging antitrust  consumer protection and similar claims relating to the company s actions to obtain and enforce patent rights 
the plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment  damages including treble and or punitive damages where allowed  disgorgement and injunctive relief 
in june  a group of state attorneys general  the district of columbia  puerto rico and the virgin islands brought similar claims 
in september  the federal trade commission ftc initiated an investigation relating to paclitaxel 
on january   the company announced that it reached agreements in principle that would settle substantially all antitrust litigation surrounding taxol 
the amount of the taxol antitrust settlements is expected to be million  the full amount of which was accrued in the third quarter of certain important terms and conditions of the settlements remain to be finalized  and certain settlements require court approval 
final approval by the state attorneys general in the taxol litigation is contingent upon further agreements relating to the terms of injunctive relief 
among the provisions remaining to be negotiated are the terms for incorporating certain claimants  including a number of health insurers  into the existing settlement framework 
the company is in discussions with a number of insurers 
whether they will ultimately join the proposed settlement cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
the company has also reached agreement with the ftc staff on the terms of a consent order that would resolve the ftc s investigation 
the proposed consent order is subject to review and approval by the ftc commissioners 
other than with respect to the abovementioned proposed settlements  it is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these lawsuits or reasonably to estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to these lawsuits 
if the proposed settlements do not become final or do not resolve all taxol related antitrust  consumer protection and similar claims  and if the company were not to prevail in final  non appealable determinations of ensuing litigation  the impact could be material 
buspar litigation on november   the company obtained a patent  us patent no 
 patent  relating to a method of using buspar or buspirone 
the company timely submitted information relating to the patent to the fda for listing in an fda publication commonly known as the orange book  and the fda thereafter listed the patent in the orange book 
delisting and patent suits 
generic drug manufacturers sued the fda and the company to compel the delisting of the patent from the orange book 
although one district court declined to order the delisting of the patent  another ordered the company to cause the delisting of the patent from the orange book 
the company complied with the court s order but appealed the decision to the united states court of appeals for the federal circuit 
the appellate court reversed the district court that ordered the delisting 
concurrently  the company sought to enforce the patent in actions against two generic drug manufacturers 
antitrust suits 
following the delisting of the patent from the orange book  a number of purchasers of buspirone and several generic drug makers filed lawsuits against the company alleging that it improperly triggered statutory marketing exclusivity 
the plaintiffs claimed that this was a violation of antitrust  consumer protection and other similar laws 
the attorneys general of states and puerto rico also filed suit against the company with parallel allegations 
the plaintiffs have amended their allegations to include charges that a agreement between the company and a generic company improperly blocked the entry of generic buspirone into the market 
plaintiffs seek declaratory judgment  damages including treble and or punitive damages where allowed  disgorgement and injunctive relief 
multidistrict litigation mdl proceedings 
the judicial panel on mdl granted the company s motions to have all of the patent and antitrust cases consolidated in a single forum 
the court before which the buspirone litigations are now pending issued two opinions dated february  in the first opinion  the court found that the patent does not cover uses of buspirone and therefore is not infringed 
in the second opinion  the court denied the company s motion to dismiss the federal antitrust and various state law claims 
the second opinion allows the claims against the company to proceed  except as to federal antitrust claims for damages accrued more than four years before the filing of the complaints 
government investigations 
the ftc and a number of state attorneys general initiated investigations concerning the matters alleged in the antitrust suits and discussed above 
the company cooperated in these investigations 
a number of attorneys general  but not all of them  filed an action against the company  as noted above 
proposed settlements 
on january   the company announced that it reached agreements in principle that would settle substantially all antitrust litigation surrounding buspar 
the amount of the buspar settlements is expected to be million  of which million was accrued in the fourth quarter of  million was accrued in the first quarter of  and million was accrued in the third quarter of written settlement agreements with a number of parties have now been signed 
certain of these settlements require court approval 
a number of health insurers have not agreed to the proposed settlement framework 
whether these cases will ultimately be settled cannot be predicted with certainty at this time 
the company has also reached agreement with the ftc staff on the terms of a consent order that would resolve the ftc s investigation 
the proposed consent order is subject to review and approval by the ftc commissioners 
other than with respect to the abovementioned proposed settlements of buspar antitrust litigation  it is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these lawsuits or reasonably to estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to these lawsuits 
if the proposed settlements do not become final or do not resolve all buspar related antitrust  consumer protection and similar claims  and if the company were not to prevail in final  non appealable determinations of ensuing litigation  the impact could be material

it is not possible at this time reasonably to assess the final outcome of these lawsuits or reasonably to estimate the possible loss or range of loss with respect to these lawsuits

recent developments the company restated its previously issued financial statements for the three years ended december   including the corresponding and interim periods  and the quarterly periods ended march  and june  the restatement affected periods prior to the impact of the restatement on such prior periods was reflected as an adjustment to opening retained earnings as of january  the restatement was reported in amendment no 
to the company s annual report on form k a for the year ended december   and amendments no 
to the company s quarterly reports on form q a for the quarterly periods ended march  and june  the company experienced a substantial buildup of wholesaler inventories in its us pharmaceuticals business over several years  primarily in and this buildup was primarily due to sales incentives offered by the company to its wholesalers 
these incentives were generally offered towards the end of a quarter in order to incentivize wholesalers to purchase products in an amount sufficient to meet the company s quarterly sales projections established by the company s senior management 
in april  the company disclosed this substantial buildup  and developed and subsequently undertook a plan to work down in an orderly fashion these wholesaler inventory levels 
in late october  based on further review and consideration of the previously disclosed buildup of wholesaler inventories in the company s us pharmaceuticals business and the incentives offered to certain wholesalers  and on advice from the company s independent auditors  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  the company determined that it was required to restate its sales and earnings to correct errors in timing of revenue recognition for certain sales to certain us pharmaceuticals wholesalers 
since that time  the company undertook an analysis of its transactions and incentive practices with us pharmaceuticals wholesalers 
as a result of its analysis  the company determined that certain of its sales to two of the largest wholesalers for the us pharmaceuticals business should be accounted for under the consignment model rather than recognizing revenue for such transactions upon shipment  based in part on the relationship between the amount of incentives offered to these wholesalers and the amount of inventory held by these wholesalers 
this determination involved evaluation of a variety of criteria and a number of complex accounting judgments 
following its determination to restate its sales and earnings for the matters described above  the company also determined that it would correct certain of its historical accounting policies to conform the accounting to us generally accepted accounting principles gaap and certain known errors made in the application of gaap that were previously not recorded because in each such case the company believed the amount of any such error was not material to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as part of the restatement process  the company investigated its accounting practices in certain areas that involve significant judgments and determined to restate additional items with respect to which the company concluded errors were made in the application of gaap  including certain revisions of inappropriate accounting 
senior management set aggressive targets for each of the company s businesses 
the errors and inappropriate accounting  which were corrected by the restatement  arose  at least in part  from a period of unrealistic expectations for  and consequent over estimation of the anticipated performance of  certain of the company s products and programs 
in connection with their audits of the restatement of previously issued annual financial statements and the company s consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   the company s independent auditors  pricewaterhousecoopers llp  identified and communicated to the company and the audit committee two material weaknesses as defined under standards established by the american institute of certified public accountants relating to the company s accounting and public financial reporting of significant matters and to its initial recording and management review and oversight of certain accounting matters 
in the last year  the company searched for and hired a new chief financial officer from outside the company  restaffed the controller position  created a position of chief compliance officer and changed leadership at the pharmaceuticals group 
in response to the wholesaler inventory buildup and the other matters identified as restatement adjustments  under the direction of the audit committee  in the last year  senior management has directed that the company dedicate resources and take steps to strengthen control processes and procedures in order to identify and rectify past accounting errors and prevent a recurrence of the circumstances that resulted in the need to restate prior period financial statements 
the company also revised its budgeting process to emphasize a bottom up approach in contrast to a top down approach 
the company has implemented a review and certification process of its annual and quarterly reports under the securities exchange act of  as amended  as well as processes designed to enhance the monitoring of wholesaler inventories 
in addition  the company is in the process of expanding its business risks and disclosure group  which includes senior management  including the chief executive officer and the chief financial officer  and is taking a number of additional steps designed to create a more open environment for communications and flow of information throughout the company 
the company continues to identify and implement actions to improve the effectiveness of its disclosure controls and procedures and internal controls  including plans to enhance its resources and training with respect to financial reporting and disclosure responsibilities  and to review such actions with its audit committee and independent auditors 
the company s accounting for certain of its sales to two of the largest wholesalers for the us pharmaceuticals business under the consignment model is discussed below under net sales 
throughout the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  all referenced amounts for prior periods and prior period comparisons reflect the balances and amounts on a restated basis 
summary in  the company reported annual global sales of billion 
sales increased from the prior year level  reflecting volume increases of  offset by net price declines of  and no net impact from foreign exchange fluctuations 
earnings from continuing operations in were  million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis  compared to  million  or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share  in several items affected the comparability of the results between and  as discussed below under earnings 
in addition to these items  earnings in were adversely affected by generic competition in the us on several key pharmaceutical products and an increase in interest expense due to the billion of debt issued in the third quarter of to finance the dupont and imclone transactions 
partially offsetting this decline in was the favorable impact of dupont operations 
in  the company had two blockbuster products  each with sales of over billion pravachol and plavix 
pravachol sales grew to billion  and plavix sales grew to billion 
in addition to these two products  the company had product lines with more than million in annual sales  including products with more than million in annual sales  of which four had annual sales in excess of million 
the company s financial position remains strong 
at december   the company held almost billion in cash  time deposits and marketable securities 
approximately billion of such cash  time deposits and marketable securities is held by the company s foreign subsidiaries 
repatriation of this cash to the us would require additional tax provisions  which are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements

patent expirations in the us on several key products  including glucophage ir  taxol and buspar  had a significant impact on the company s financial performance during us patents that are expected to expire in the next three years include the patent for cefzil december and one of several patents relating to plavix july 
in addition  a use patent for paraplatin will expire in april hatch waxman data protection will expire for glucophage xr in october  and for glucovance in july all of these expiry dates could be extended by six months under the pediatric extension upon the completion and acceptance of pediatric studies by the fda in advance of the expiration 
the company received the six month pediatric extension for the composition of matter patent for monopril  which is now expected to expire in june  and the composition of matter patent for serzone  which is now expected to expire in september  and a patent covering the formulation of videx ec  which is now expected to expire in may except with respect to plavix  as discussed in item  legal proceedings  in part i of this form k and note  litigation matters  to the consolidated financial statements  the company believes that no single patent or license is of material importance in relation to the business as a whole

in general  the company s business is not seasonal 
for information on us pharmaceuticals prescriber demand  reference is made to the table on page  which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total both retail and mail order customers prescription growth for certain of the company s primary care pharmaceutical products 
the composition of the net increase in sales is as follows foreign exchange volume selling prices  net increase in sales a significant portion of the company s us pharmaceuticals sales is made to wholesalers 
the company experienced a substantial buildup of wholesaler inventories in its us pharmaceuticals business over several years  primarily in and this buildup was primarily due to sales incentives offered by the company to its wholesalers  including discounts  buy ins in anticipation of price increases  and extended payment terms to certain us pharmaceuticals wholesalers 
these incentives were generally offered towards the end of a quarter in order to incentivize wholesalers to purchase products in an amount sufficient to meet the company s quarterly sales projections established by the company s senior management 
the timing of the company s recognition of revenue from its sales to wholesalers differs by wholesaler and by period 
historically  the company recognized revenue for sales upon shipment of product to its customers 
under gaap  revenue is recognized when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred 
in the case of sales made to wholesalers as a result of incentives  in excess of the wholesaler s ordinary course of business inventory level  at a time when there was an understanding  agreement  course of dealing or consistent business practice that the company would extend incentives based on levels of excess inventory in connection with future purchases and at a time when such incentives would cover substantially all  and vary directly with  the wholesaler s cost of carrying inventory in excess of the wholesaler s ordinary course of business inventory level  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership do not transfer upon shipment and  accordingly  such sales should be accounted for using the consignment model 
the determination of when  if at all  sales to a wholesaler meet the foregoing criteria involves evaluation of a variety of factors and a number of complex judgments 
under the consignment model  the company does not recognize revenue upon shipment of product 
rather  upon shipment of product the company invoices the wholesaler  records deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price and classifies the inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory at the company s cost of such inventory 
the company recognizes revenue net of discounts  rebates  estimated sales allowances and accruals for returns when the consignment inventory is no longer subject to incentive arrangements but not later than when such inventory is sold through to the wholesalers customers  on a first in first out fifo basis 
for additional discussion of the company s revenue recognition policy  see note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
the company restated its previously issued financial statements for the period through the second quarter of to correct the timing of revenue recognition for certain previously recognized us pharmaceuticals sales to cardinal health  inc cardinal and mckesson corporation mckesson  two of the largest wholesalers for the company s us pharmaceuticals business  that  based on the application of the criteria described above  were recorded in error at the time of shipment and should have been accounted for using the consignment model 
the company determined that shipments of product to cardinal and shipments of product to mckesson met the consignment model criteria set forth above as of july  and july   respectively  and  in each case  continuing through the end of and for some period thereafter 
accordingly  the consignment model was required to be applied to such shipments 
prior to those respective periods  the company recognized revenue with respect to sales to cardinal and mckesson upon shipment of product 
although the company generally views approximately one month of supply as a desirable level of wholesaler inventory on a going forward basis and as a level of wholesaler inventory representative of an industry average  in applying the consignment model to sales to cardinal and mckesson  the company defined inventory in excess of the wholesaler s ordinary course of business inventory level as inventory above two weeks and three weeks of supply  respectively  based on the levels of inventory that cardinal and mckesson required to be used as the basis for negotiation of incentives granted 
as a result of this restatement adjustment  net sales were reduced by  million  million and million in  and  respectively  and increased by million in the six months ended june  the corresponding effect on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was a reduction of million  million and million in  and  respectively  and an increase of million in the six months ended june  separately from the above discussion  in march  the company entered into a distribution agreement with mckesson for provision of warehousing and order fulfillment services for the company s oncology therapeutics network otn  a specialty distributor of anti cancer medicines and related products 
prior to the restatement  the company recorded in error sales of the company s products under this agreement upon shipment of product to mckesson 
the company restated its previously issued financial statements to account for these sales under the consignment model 
the resulting effect on net sales and earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was a reduction of million and million  respectively  in  and an increase of million and million  respectively  in the six months ended june  at december   and  the company s aggregate cost of the pharmaceutical products held by cardinal and mckesson that were accounted for using the consignment model and  accordingly  were reflected as consignment inventory on the company s consolidated balance sheet was approximately million  million and million  respectively  of which approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  related to otn 
the deferred revenue  recorded at gross invoice sales price  related to the inventory of pharmaceutical products accounted for using the consignment model was approximately million   million and million at december   and  respectively  of which approximately million and million at december  and  respectively  related to otn 
as a result of the restatement for the application of the consignment model  approximately  million of sales calculated net of customary early pay cash discounts had been reversed from the period through  of which approximately  million was recognized in as inventory held by cardinal and mckesson was worked down and approximately million is projected to be recognized in  a significant portion of which is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of the corresponding effect on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes was an increase of  million in the corresponding projected effect on earnings from continuing operations before minority interest and income taxes for is an increase of approximately million  a significant portion of which is expected to be recognized in the first quarter of sales to cardinal and mckesson represented approximately   and of us pharmaceuticals net sales in   and  respectively 
the company has determined that  although sales incentives were offered to other wholesalers and there was a buildup of inventories at such wholesalers  the consignment model criteria discussed above were not met 
accordingly  the company recognized revenue when the products were shipped to these wholesalers 
the company estimates that the inventory of pharmaceutical products held by these other us pharmaceuticals wholesalers in excess of approximately one month of supply in the case of the company s exclusive products  approximately one and a half months of supply in the case of plavix and avapro  which are marketed under the company s alliance with sanofi synthelabo  and approximately two months of supply in the case of the company s non exclusive products  was in the range of approximately million to million at december  the company s estimates of inventories held by wholesalers are based on the projected prescription demand based sales for its products  as well as the company s analysis of third party information  including information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell through to customers and third party market research data  and the company s internal information 
the company s estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third party data  as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates  and reflect other limitations 
in april  the company disclosed the substantial buildup of wholesaler inventories in its us pharmaceuticals business  and developed and subsequently undertook a plan to work down in an orderly fashion these wholesaler inventory levels 
to facilitate an orderly workdown  the company s plan included continuing to offer sales incentives  at reduced levels  to certain wholesalers 
with respect to mckesson and cardinal  the company entered into agreements for an orderly workdown that provide for these wholesalers to make specified levels of purchases and for the company to offer specified levels of incentives through the workdown period 
the company expects that the orderly workdown of inventories of its pharmaceutical products held by all us pharmaceuticals wholesalers will be substantially completed at or before the end of the company also expects that the consignment model criteria will no longer be met with respect to the company s us pharmaceuticals sales to cardinal and mckesson other than the abovementioned sales related to otn at or before the end of at december   the company s aggregate cost of pharmaceutical products held by cardinal and mckesson that were accounted for using the consignment model and  accordingly  were reflected as consignment inventory on the company s consolidated balance sheet was approximately million 
at december   the deferred revenue  recorded at gross invoice sales price  related to such inventory was approximately million  including approximately million related to otn 
the company estimates  based on the data noted above  that the inventory of pharmaceutical products held by the other us pharmaceuticals wholesalers in excess of or below approximately one month of supply in the case of the company s exclusive products  approximately one and a half months of supply in the case of plavix and avapro  which are marketed under the company s alliance with sanofi synthelabo  and approximately two months of supply in the case of the company s non exclusive products was in the range of approximately million below this level of supply to million in excess of this level of supply at december  this estimate is subject to the inherent limitations noted above 
the company expects to account for certain pharmaceutical sales relating to otn using the consignment model until the abovementioned agreement with mckesson expires in the company s financial results and prior period and quarterly comparisons are affected by the buildup and orderly workdown of wholesaler inventories  as well as the application of the consignment model to certain sales to certain wholesalers 
in addition  with respect to sales not accounted for using the consignment model  the company s financial results and prior period and quarterly comparisons are affected by fluctuations in the buying patterns of wholesalers  including the effect of incentives offered  and the corresponding changes in inventory levels maintained by these wholesalers 
these wholesaler buying patterns and wholesaler inventory levels may not reflect underlying prescriber demand 
for information on us pharmaceuticals prescriber demand  reference is made to the table on page  which sets forth a comparison of changes in net sales to the estimated total both retail and mail order customers prescription growth for certain of the company s primary care pharmaceutical products 
the company expects that when the consignment model is no longer being applied with respect to sales to cardinal or mckesson  the buying patterns and fluctuations in inventory levels of these wholesalers will have an effect on the company s financial results and prior period and quarterly comparisons

recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the company is in the process of assessing what impact this pronouncement will have on its consolidated financial statements 
based on its preliminary analysis of the impact of fin  the company believes that it is reasonably possible that imclone could meet the criteria to be considered a variable interest entity in relation to the company 
accordingly  the company included the required transitional disclosures of fin in note  alliances and investments  to the consolidated financial statements

retirement benefits plan description the company and certain of its subsidiaries have defined benefit pension plans and defined contribution plans for regular full time employees 
the principal defined benefit pension plan is the bristol myers squibb retirement income plan and the principal defined contribution plan is the bristol myers squibb savings and investment program 
approximately of total company defined benefit pension plan assets and liabilities are held in us plans 
the assets for the us plans are held in a single trust with a common asset allocation 
unless specified otherwise  the references in this section are to total company plans us plans together with international plans 
benefits under the company s defined benefit pension plans are based primarily on years of credited service and on participants compensation 
assets under the company s defined benefit plans consist primarily of equity and fixed income securities 
at december   the fair market value of plan assets for the company s defined benefit plans decreased to  million from  million at december  for the us plans  assets were allocated to equity securities compared to at the end of  to fixed income securities compared to at the end of and to real estate and other investments no change from the end of 
bristol myers squibb common stock represented less than of assets for the us plans at the end of and the company provides comprehensive medical and group life benefits for substantially all us retirees who elect to participate in the company s comprehensive medical and group life plans 
the asset allocation for these postretirement plans is identical to the asset allocation described above for the us defined benefit pension plans 
accrual accounting and significant assumptions consistent with the gaap requirements set forth in sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  the company accounts for pension benefits using the accrual method  recognizing pension expense before the payment of benefits to retirees 
the accrual method of accounting for pension benefits necessarily requires actuarial assumptions concerning future events that will determine the amount and timing of the benefit payments 
the company s key assumptions used in calculating its cost of pension benefits are the discount rate  the rate of compensation increase and the expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the company  in consultation with its actuaries  evaluates the key actuarial assumptions and other assumptions used in calculating its cost of pension benefits  such as retirement  turnover and mortality rates  based on expectations or actual experience  as appropriate  and determines such assumptions on december of each year to calculate liability information as of that date and pension expense for the following year 
depending on the assumptions used  the pension expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding 
actual results in any given year may differ from those estimated because of economic and other factors 
the assumed discount rate used by the company for determining future pension obligations under the us plans is based on indices of aa and aaa rated corporate bonds 
the indices of high quality corporate bonds selected reflect the weighted average remaining period of benefit payments 
the assumed rate of compensation increase used by the company for determining future pension obligations reflects an estimate of the change in actual future compensation levels due to general price levels  productivity  seniority and other factors 
in  net pension expense for the company s defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before minority interest and income taxes was million  compared to million in which included million for a us curtailment settlement loss 
the us plans pension expense for was determined using a assumed discount rate and a assumed rate of compensation increase 
the accumulated benefit obligation at december  for the us plans was determined using a assumed discount rate 
if the assumed discount rate used in determining the us plans pension expense for had been reduced by  such expense would have increased by approximately million 
if the assumed rate of compensation increase used in determining the us plans pension expense for had been reduced by  such expense would have decreased by approximately million 
if the assumed discount rate used in determining the accumulated benefit obligation at december  had been reduced by  the accumulated benefit obligation would have increased by million 
in determining the expected long term rate of return on plan assets  the company evaluates allocation of assets and the expected returns on various asset classes 
the company evaluates any short term market volatility in the context of the long term nature of pension commitments 
the us plans pension expense for was determined using a expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
if the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used in determining the us plans pension expense for had been reduced by  such expense would have increased by million 
actual rates of return earned on us plan assets for each of the last ten years were as follows year return year return as discussed below  accounting principles provide that differences between expected and actual returns are recognized over the average future service of employees 
at december   the company lowered its assumed discount rate from to  to reflect a decline in yields on high quality corporate bonds  and its assumed rate of compensation increase from to  to reflect expectations of lower inflation in the future and consistent with the reduction in the assumed discount rate 
the reduction in the assumed discount rate increased the present value of future benefit obligations and  accordingly  had the effect of increasing us plans pension expense for in contrast  a reduction in the assumed rate of compensation increase decreased the present value of benefit obligations and  accordingly  had the effect of decreasing us plans pension expense for at december   the company further lowered its assumed discount rate for us plans from to and its assumed rate of compensation increase for us plans from to 
in the aggregate  these revisions had the effect of increasing the present value of future benefit obligations and  accordingly  will have the effect of increasing pension expense for in addition  the company revised  based on a change in its expectations of future terminations and retirements  its retirement and turnover assumptions 
this revision had the effect of decreasing the present value of future benefit obligations and  accordingly  will have the effect of decreasing pension expense for over the course of the last several years  global equity markets have experienced negative returns 
the negative equity market returns of and have been compounded by a further market decline in s p declined by 
the company evaluates market conditions in determining its expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
the company reduced the expected rate of return on us plans assets at december  from to 
this reduction is expected to result in higher pension expense for of approximately million 
the company expects that the net pension expense for its defined benefit pension plans included in earnings before minority interest and income taxes will be approximately million higher in than in  reflecting  among other things  the decreases in the assumed discount rate and expected long term rate of return outlined above and a decrease in the value of the assets in the company s defined benefit pension plans 
the company used the same assumed discount rates and expected long term rates of return on plan assets in calculating its cost of postretirement benefits as it did in calculating its cost of pension benefits 
delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses at december  and  unrecognized net actuarial losses for the company s defined benefit plans were  million and million  respectively  based on the fair market value of plan assets 
these unrecognized net actuarial losses reflect a decline in the fair market value of plan assets and a reduction of the weighted average discount rate in and sfas no 
provides for delayed recognition of actuarial gains and losses  including amounts arising from changes in the estimated plan benefit obligations due to changes in the assumed discount rate  differences between the actual and expected returns on plan assets  and other assumption changes 
sfas no 
requires that unrecognized net actuarial gain or loss  determined based on the market related value of plan assets which differs from fair market value and is a calculated value that recognizes changes in fair value in a systematic and rational manner over not more than five years  be amortized in pension income or expense for the year to the extent that such unrecognized net actuarial loss or gain exceeds of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year 
these net gains and losses are recognized as pension income or expense prospectively over a period that approximates the average remaining service period of active employees expected to receive benefits under the plans approximately years to the extent that they are not offset by losses and gains in subsequent years 
at december   the unrecognized net actuarial loss  determined based on the market related value of plan assets  was million 
this amount did not exceed of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets at the beginning of the year and  accordingly  was not required to be amortized as pension expense for at december   the unrecognized net actuarial loss  determined based on the market related value of plan assets  was million 
this amount exceeded of the greater of the projected benefit obligation or the market related value of plan assets by million 
unless offset by future unrecognized gains from higher discount rates or higher than expected returns on plan assets  amortization of this million unrecognized loss is expected to increase pension expense for each of the following ten years by approximately million per year  which amount is reflected in the expected increase in pension expense for of approximately million compared to in the event the fair market value of pension plan assets of a particular plan is less than the accumulated benefit obligation for such plan at year end  gaap may require an additional minimum liability and  in such circumstances  a reduction in stockholders equity or an establishment of an intangible asset 
at december   fair market value of the company s defined benefit pension plan assets was  million  and the related accumulated benefit obligation was  million 
at december   the fair market value of the company s defined benefit pension plans assets was  million and the related accumulated benefit obligation was  million 
the company recognized an additional minimum liability of million at december   which was offset by the creation of a million intangible asset and million charge in other comprehensive income included in stockholders equity 
the company also recognized an additional minimum liability of approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
plan funding the company s funding policy for defined benefit plans is to contribute amounts to provide for current service and to fund past service liability 
the company contributed to the defined benefit plans million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the recent decline in the global equity markets has resulted in a decrease in the value of the assets in the company s pension plans 
this decline is expected to adversely affect the company s related accounting results in future periods through higher pension expense and increased cash funding requirements 
the company s contribution to the defined contribution plans is based on employee contributions and the level of company match 
the company contributed to the principal defined contribution plan million  million and million in  and  respectively 
critical accounting policies the company prepares its financial statements in accordance with gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with gaap requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  including disclosure of contingent assets and contingent liabilities  at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the company s critical accounting policies are those that are both most important to the company s financial condition and results of operations and require the most difficult  subjective or complex judgments on the part of management in their application  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
because of the uncertainty of factors surrounding the estimates or judgments used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements  actual results may vary from these estimates 
the company believes that the following represent its critical accounting policies 
for a summary of all of the company s significant accounting policies  including the critical accounting policies discussed below  see note  accounting policies  to the consolidated financial statements 
management and the company s independent accountants have discussed the company s critical accounting policies with the audit committee of the board of directors 
revenue recognition the company s accounting policy for revenue recognition has a substantial impact on its reported results and relies on certain estimates that require the most difficult  subjective and complex judgments on the part of management 
the company recognizes revenue for sales upon shipment of product to its customers  except in the case of certain transactions with its us pharmaceuticals wholesalers which are accounted for using the consignment model 
under gaap  revenue is recognized when substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership have transferred 
in the case of sales made to wholesalers as a result of incentives  in excess of the wholesaler s ordinary course of business inventory level  at a time when there was an understanding  agreement  course of dealing or consistent business practice that the company would extend incentives based on levels of excess inventory in connection with future purchases and at a time when such incentives would cover substantially all  and vary directly with  the wholesaler s cost of carrying inventory in excess of the wholesaler s ordinary course of business inventory level  substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership do not transfer upon shipment and  accordingly  such sales should be accounted for using the consignment model 
the determination of when  if at all  sales to a wholesaler meet the foregoing criteria involves evaluation of a variety of factors and a number of complex judgments 
under the consignment model  the company does not recognize revenue upon shipment of product 
rather  upon shipment of product the company invoices the wholesaler  records deferred revenue at gross invoice sales price and classifies the inventory held by the wholesalers as consignment inventory at the company s cost of such inventory 
the company recognizes revenue net of discounts  rebates  sales allowances and accruals for returns  all of which involve significant estimates and judgments when the consignment inventory is no longer subject to incentive arrangements but not later than when such inventory is sold through to the wholesalers customers  on a first in first out fifo basis 
the company s estimates of inventory at the wholesalers and deferred revenue on consigned inventory are based on the projected prescription demand based sales for its products  as well as the company s analysis of third party information  including information obtained from certain wholesalers with respect to their inventory levels and sell through to customers and third party market research data  and the company s internal information 
the company s estimates are subject to inherent limitations of estimates that rely on third party data  as certain third party information was itself in the form of estimates  and reflect other limitations 
acquired in process research and development the fair value of in process research and development acquired in a business combination acquired ipr d is determined by independent appraisal and based on the present value of each research project s projected cash flows  utilizing an income approach consistent with the aicpa practice aid  assets acquired in business combinations to be used in research and development activities a focus in software  electronic devices and pharmaceutical industries 
future cash flows are predominately based on the net income forecast of each project consistent with historical pricing  margins and expense levels of similar products 
revenues are estimated based on relevant market size and growth factors  expected industry trends  individual project life cycles and the life of each research project s underlying patent 
in determining the fair value of each research project  expected revenues are first adjusted for technical risk of completion 
the resulting cash flows are then discounted at a rate approximating the company s weighted average cost of capital 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  the company periodically evaluates whether current facts or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of its depreciable long lived assets to be held and used may not be recoverable 
if such circumstances are determined to exist  an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows produced by the long lived asset  or the appropriate grouping of assets  is compared to the carrying value to determine whether an impairment exists 
if an asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured based on quoted market prices in active markets  if available 
if quoted market prices are not available  the estimate of fair value is based on various valuation techniques  including a discounted value of estimated future cash flows 
the company reports an asset to be disposed of at the lower of its carrying value or its estimated net realizable value 
goodwill is evaluated at least annually for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill be tested for impairment using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment  and the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
goodwill is deemed to be impaired if the carrying amount of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its estimated fair value 
sfas no 
requires that indefinite lived intangible assets be tested for impairment using a one step process  which consists of a comparison of the fair value to the carrying value of the intangible asset 
intangible assets are deemed to be impaired if the net book value exceeds the estimated fair value 
the estimates of future cash flows  based on reasonable and supportable assumptions and projections  require management s judgment 
any changes in key assumptions about the company s businesses and their prospects  or changes in market conditions  could result in an impairment charge 
equity investments the company reviews its equity investments for impairment based on its determination of whether the decline in market value of the investment below the company s carrying value is other than temporary 
in making this determination  the company considers accounting principles board opinion no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock  which sets forth factors to be evaluated in determining whether a loss in value should be recognized  including the company s ability to hold its investment  the market price and market price fluctuations of the investment s publicly traded shares and inability of the investee to sustain an earnings capacity which would justify the carrying amount of the investment 
the company s investment in imclone is subject to this accounting 
see note  alliances and investments  to the consolidated financial statements for a discussion of the company s investment in imclone 
retirement benefits the company s pension plans and postretirement benefit plans are accounted for using actuarial valuations required by sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
the company considers accounting for retirement plans critical because management is required to make significant subjective judgments about a number of actuarial assumptions  including discount rates  salary growth  long term return on plan assets  retirement  turnover  health care cost trend rates and mortality rates 
depending on the assumptions and estimates used  the pension and postretirement benefit expense could vary within a range of outcomes and have a material effect on reported earnings 
in addition  the assumptions can materially affect accumulated benefit obligations and future cash funding 
for a detailed discussion of the company s retirement benefits  see retirement benefits above  and note  retirement plans  and note  postretirement benefit plans other than pensions  to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring to downsize and streamline operations and rationalize manufacturing facilities  the company has periodically recorded restructuring charges 
as a result  the company has made estimates and judgments regarding its future plans  including future termination benefits and other exit costs to be incurred when the restructuring actions take place 
actual results could vary from these estimates resulting in an adjustment to earnings 
contingencies in the normal course of business  the company is subject to contingencies  such as legal proceedings and claims arising out of its business  that cover a wide range of matters  including product liability  environmental liability and tax matters 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  the company records accruals for such contingencies when it is probable that a liability will be incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
for a discussion of contingencies  reference is made to note  income taxes  and note  litigation matters  to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes as of december   taxes were not provided on approximately billion of undistributed earnings of foreign subsidiaries  as the company has invested or expects to invest the undistributed earnings indefinitely 
if in the future these earnings are repatriated to the united states  or if the company determines such earnings will be remitted in the foreseeable future  additional tax provisions would be required 
due to complexities in the tax laws and the assumptions that would have to be made  it is not practicable to estimate the amounts of income taxes that would have to be provided 
the company evaluates the need for a deferred tax asset valuation allowance by assessing whether it is more likely than not that it will realize its deferred tax assets in the future 
the assessment of whether or not a valuation allowance is required often requires significant judgement including the forecast of future taxable income and the evaluation of tax planning initiatives 
adjustments to the deferred tax valuation allowance are made to earnings in the period when such assessment is made 
in addition  the company has operations in tax jurisdictions located in most areas of the world and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
tax audits by their nature are often complex and can require several years to resolve 
accruals for tax contingencies require management to make estimates and judgments with respect to the ultimate outcome of a tax audit 
actual results could vary from these estimates 
outlook for the company currently expects sales growth to more closely reflect underlying prescription trends 
sales growth is expected to benefit from the absence of significant inventory workdown at wholesalers not on the consignment model 
expected sales growth drivers are several key products  including  plavix  avapro  pravachol  paraplatin  abilify and the expected introduction of atazanavir  subject to fda approval  as well as growth in the otn business
