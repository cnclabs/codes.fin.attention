item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the information presented in the following discussion of financial results of first financial is largely indicative of the activities of its operating subsidiary  first federal  which comprises the substantial majority of the consolidated net income  revenues and assets of the company 
during the year ended september   the company consolidated its previously owned subsidiary  peoples federal into first federal 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the selected consolidated financial data contained in item of this report and the consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes contained in item of this report 
first financial s earnings were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal  declining by 
basic and diluted earnings per share in improved to and  respectively  compared with and  respectively  in net income was million in basic and diluted earnings per share totaled and in  respectively 
net earnings resulted in a return on average equity of  and for the three years ended september   respectively 
the return on average assets for the three years ended september  was  and  respectively 
first financial s earnings declined in fiscal as a result of several factors 
first  the company s net interest margin declined to in fiscal from in fiscal average earning asset levels also declined and the combination of these factors lead to a million decline in net interest income 
secondly  non interest revenues increased million  or  over fiscal principally as a result of growth in revenues from insurance services  banking fees and increased loan  investment and mortgage backed securities sales 
offsetting these increases was a million increase in non interest expense  principally of additional insurance operations acquired and normal growth related to the level of business activity and expansion 
average diluted shares for the fiscal year ended september  declined by  shares  due principally to the execution of stock repurchase programs 
first financial s net income increased million in fiscal  or approximately  over fiscal growth in net income was principally attributable to expansion of net interest income  as average net interest margins increased 
another important factor in fiscal was the million  or  increase in non interest revenues over fiscal the increase in non interest revenues for fiscal was mainly attributable to the expansion and growth of insurance operations that produced a increase in insurance revenues over fiscal on september   first financial announced that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of first financial s common stock 
approximately  shares were repurchased under the program in fiscal with a total of approximately  shares purchased under the plan since its inception 
the plan expired on september  the board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program on october  to acquire up to  shares 
during fiscal the company completed the repurchase program at a final cost of million 
on may  an additional stock repurchase plan was authorized by the board of directors to acquire up to  shares 
during fiscal the company purchased approximately  shares at a cost of approximately million under this plan 
critical accounting policies first financial s accounting policies are discussed in item  note to the consolidated financial statements 
of these significant accounting policies  first financial has determined that accounting for allowance for loan losses the allowance  income taxes  mortgage servicing rights and purchase accounting are deemed critical because of the valuation techniques used  and the sensitivity of these financial statement amounts to the methods  assumptions and estimates underlying these balances 
accounting for these critical areas requires the most subjective and complex judgments that could be subject to revision as new information becomes available 
as explained in note and note to the consolidated financial statements  the allowance for loan losses represents management s estimate of probable credit losses inherent in the loan portfolio 
this estimate is based on the current economy s impact on the timing and expected amounts of future cash flows on impaired loans  as well as historical loss experience associated with homogenous pools of loans 
the company s assessments may be impacted in future periods by changes in economic conditions  the impact of regulatory examinations  and the discovery of information with respect to borrowers  which is not known to management at the time of the issuance of the consolidated financial statements 
for additional discussion concerning the company s allowance and related matters  see financial position allowance for loan losses 
accounting for mortgage servicing rights is more fully discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements and is another area heavily dependent on current economic conditions  especially the interest rate environment  and management s estimates 
the company utilizes the expertise of a third party consultant to determine this asset s value 
the consultant utilizes estimates for the amount and timing of mortgage loan repayments  estimated prepayment rates  credit loss experience  costs to service loans and discount rates to determine an estimate of the fair value of our mortgage servicing rights asset 
management believes that the modeling techniques and assumptions used by the consultant are reasonable 
the income tax amounts disclosed in note reflect the current period income tax expense for all periods shown  as well as future tax liabilities associated with differences in the timing of expenses and income recognition for book and tax accounting purposes 
the income tax returns  usually filed nine months after year end  are subject to review and possible revision by the tax authorities up until the statue of limitations has expired 
these statues usually expire three years after the time the respective tax returns have been filed 
acquisitions by the company are made through the use of the purchase method of accounting and are more fully discussed in note of the financial statements 
the company relies heavily on third party expertise in the valuing of these acquisitions 
management relies on historical as well as pro forma balance sheet and income statement information to determine these values 
these estimated fair values are subject to change as economic and market specific conditions change 
the company tests goodwill for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
potential impairment of goodwill exists when the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its implied fair value 
the fair value for each reporting unit is computed using one or a combination of the following three methods income  market value  or cost method 
the company used the cost method to determine if goodwill was impaired 
the cost method assumes the net assets of a recent business combinations accounted for under the purchase method of accounting will be recorded at fair value if no event or circumstance has occurred triggering a decline in value 
to the extent  a reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and a second step of impairment test will be performed 
for additional discussion  see item  note to the consolidated financial statements 
acquisitions on june   first financial acquired the southeast portion of the claim access and assets of mca administrators  inc based in pittsburgh  pennsylvania 
the business acquired was consolidated with benefit administrators  inc  an affiliate company of johnson insurance associates  inc johnson insurance  acquired in fiscal  a subsidiary of first southeast insurance services  which provides third party administrative services for self insured health insurance plans 
on march   first financial acquired the operations of woodruff company  inc woodruff  an independent insurance agency based in columbia  south carolina 
woodruff s operations were merged into johnson insurance 
during fiscal  first financial acquired johnson insurance  a full service independent insurance agency located in columbia  south carolina  specializing primarily in commercial insurance lines 
the company also acquired benefit administrators  inc  an affiliated company providing third party administrative services for self insured health insurance plans 
this acquisition occurred on august  this transaction was accounted for as a purchase of stock with months of johnson insurance s operations included in fiscal results 
on may   the company acquired the hilton head  bluffton and ridgeland operations of the kinghorn insurance agency  a full service independent insurance agency specializing primarily in retail insurance lines 
these operations are included under kinghorn insurance services  inc kinghorn  a subsidiary of first southeast insurance services 
the transaction was accounted for as a purchase of assets with four months of kinghorn s operations included in fiscal results 
one of the stated long term objectives of the company is diversification of its revenue sources 
increasingly  the company has sought to achieve this objective through either the purchase of insurance agencies or assets of insurance agencies 
the company also believes these acquisitions present significant cross sales opportunities and provide the company with the ability to offer an expanded menu of products to customers 
financial position at september   first financial s assets totaled billion  increasing slightly by  or million  from september  first financial s assets remained relatively flat during the year  reflecting the state of the us economy during the past year and record low interest rates 
the company experienced weak commercial loan demand and increased mortgage loan refinancing activity during fiscal the change in assets during fiscal was principally attributable to an increase of million in mortgage backed securities  offset by a decline of million in net loans receivable and loans held for sale 
average assets  however  decreased by during the year and average interest earning assets decreased by 
lower market interest rates in fiscal led to record fixed rate residential loan originations 
agency qualifying fixed rate mortgage loan originations are normally sold by the company  increasing loans sales substantially in fiscal and also precipitating lower levels of residential loans held in the company s loan portfolio 
at september   first financial s assets also totaled billion  declining slightly  by  or million  from september  the decline in assets was principally attributable to declines of million in mortgage backed securities  million in cash and cash equivalents and million in net loans receivable offset partially by growth of million in loans held for sale 
investment securities and mortgage backed securities at september   available for sale securities totaled million compared to million at september  average balances of available for sale securities increased slightly to million during fiscal from million during fiscal as market interest rates declined in fiscal  prepayments of the mortgage backed securities portfolio increased dramatically 
during the last two quarters of fiscal  the company made additional purchases of mortgage backed securities to augment earning asset growth 
the primary objective of the company in its management of the investment and mortgage backed securities portfolio is to maintain a portfolio of high quality  highly liquid investments with returns competitive with short term us treasury or agency securities and highly rated corporate securities 
the association is required to maintain an adequate amount of liquidity to ensure safe and sound operations 
the association has maintained balances in short term investments and mortgage backed securities based on a continuing assessment of cash flows  the level of loan production  current interest rate risk strategies and the assessment of the potential future direction of market interest rate changes 
loans receivable loans comprise the largest portion of interest earning assets of the company  accounting for and of average interest earning assets in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
compared with balances on september   net loans receivable declined by million during fiscal loans held for sale declined million to million at september  real estate loan originations were higher in fiscal than in fiscal primarily as a result of the effect of record low market interest rates and increased refinancing activity 
loan growth under such conditions  however  slowed dramatically as a result of much higher levels of sales of agency qualifying residential loans 
the company s loan portfolio consists of real estate mortgage and construction loans  home equity  mobile home and other consumer loans  credit card receivables and commercial business loans 
the company believes that the increase in consumer and commercial loans and lower levels of single family mortgage loans will have a positive effect of the overall yield on the loan portfolio 
however  these loans generally have higher credit risks than single family residential loans  a significant factor in the growth of net loan charge offs during recent years 
asset quality the company believes it maintains a conservative philosophy regarding its lending mix as well as its underwriting guidelines 
the company also maintains loan quality monitoring policies and systems that require detailed monthly and quarterly analyses of delinquencies  nonperforming loans  real estate owned and other repossessed assets 
reports of such loans and assets by various categories are reviewed by management and the board of directors of the association 
the majority of the company s loan originations are in coastal south carolina and north carolina and inland in florence county  south carolina 
as a result of management s ongoing review of the loan portfolio  loans are classified as non accruing when uncertainty exists about the ultimate collection of principal and interest under the original terms 
the company closely monitors trends in problem assets which include non accrual loans  loans days or more delinquent  renegotiated loans  and real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans 
renegotiated loans are those loans on which the company has agreed to modifications of the terms of the loan such as changes in the interest rate charged and or other concessions 
the following table illustrates trends in problem assets and other asset quality indicators over the past five years 
table problem assets dollars in thousands at september  non accrual loans      accruing loans days or more delinquent renegotiated loans    real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans   as a percent of loans receivable and real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans as a percent of total assets allowance for loan losses as a percent of problem loans net charge offs to average loans outstanding problem assets were million at september   or

of loans receivable and real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans 
at september   problem assets were million  or 
of assets and 
of loans receivable and real estate and other assets acquired in settlement of loans 
loans on non accrual declined to million at september  from million in fiscal real estate and other assets in settlement of loans increased to million from million at september  management s long term goals continue to include lower ratios of problem assets to total assets  although management expects there will always remain a core level of delinquent loans and real estate acquired in settlement of loans from normal lending operations 
allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses allowance is maintained at a level sufficient to provide for estimated probable losses in the loan portfolio at each reporting date 
management reviews the adequacy of the allowance no less frequently than each quarter  utilizing its internal portfolio analysis system 
the factors that are considered in a determination of the level of the allowance are management s assessment of current economic conditions  the composition of the loan portfolio  previous loss experience on certain types of credit  a review of specific high risk sectors of the loan portfolio  selected individual loans and concentrations of credit 
the value of the underlying collateral is also considered during such reviews 
the methodology for assessing the adequacy of the allowance establishes both an allocated and an unallocated component 
during the past few years  the calculation of the allowance was modified and refined to more closely track the company s historical loss rates 
the previous methodology used a range of reserves based on industry loss data for certain types of loans 
the allocated component of the allowance for single family loans is currently based on recent loss rates and also contains a component determined by management s assessment of current economic conditions 
the allocated components for commercial real estate  multifamily loans and commercial business loans are based principally on current loan grades  recent loss rates and an allocation attributable to current economic conditions 
the allocated component for consumer loans is based on loan payment status  recent loss rates and also includes an allocation based on economic conditions 
management is curr ently using the most recent year s loss rates in determining its allocated allowance because historical loss rates may not adequately reflect weakening economic conditions since fiscal the unallocated component of the allowance represents the results of analyses that estimate probable losses inherent in the portfolio that are not fully captured in the allocated allowance 
these analyses include but are not limited to industry concentrations  model imprecision and the estimated impact of current economic conditions on historical loss rates 
we continually monitor trends in loan portfolio qualitative and quantitative factors  including trends in the levels of past due  criticized and nonperforming loans 
the trends in these factors are used to evaluate the reasonableness of the unallocated component 
to determine the adequacy of the allowance and the need for potential changes to the allowance  a formal analysis is completed quarterly to assess the risk with in the loan portfolio 
this assessment includes analyses of historical performance  past due trends  the level of nonperforning loans  reviews of certain impaired loans  loan activity since the last quarter  consideration of current economic conditions  and other pertinent information 
loans are assigned ratings  either individually for larger credits or in homogeneous pools  based on an internally developed grading system 
the resulting conclusions are reviewed and approved by senior management 
the allocation of the allowance to the respective loan classifications is not necessarily indicative of future losses or future allocations 
should the loan portfolio increase substantially  should current loss experience continue in future periods  should classified and delinquent loans increase or economic conditions deteriorate further  then the provision for loan losses may increase in future periods 
the entire allowance is available to absorb losses in the loan portfolio 
assessing the adequacy of the allowance is a process that requires considerable judgment 
management s judgments are based on numerous assumptions about current events  which we believe to be reasonable  but which may or may not be valid 
thus  there can be no assurance that loan losses in future periods will not exceed the current allowance amount or that future increases in the allowance will not be required 
no assurance can be given that management s ongoing evaluation of the loan portfolio in light of changing economic conditions and other relevant circumstances will not require significant future additions to the allowance  thus adversely affecting the operating results of the company 
the allowance is also subject to examination and adequacy testing by regulatory agencies  which may consider such factors as the methodology used to determine adequacy and the size of the allowance relative to that of peer institutions  and other adequacy tests 
these regulatory agencies could require us to adjust our allowance based on information available to them at the time of their examination 
the allowance totaled million and million  or 
and 
of net loans  at september  and  respectively 
during fiscal  first financial lowered the allowance by  in connection with reductions in classified assets  changes in the composition of loans  an overall decrease in loan balances and the level of charge offs 
the ratio of the allowance to nonperforming loans  which include nonaccrual loans  accruing loans days or more delinquent and renegotiated loans  was times and times at september  and september   respectively 
nonperforming loans decreased to million as of september  from million at september  see asset quality above 
our analysis of allowance adequacy includes an impairment analysis for each nonperforming commercial loan 
based on the current economic environment and other factors  management believes that the allowance at september  was maintained at a level adequate to provide for estimated probable losses in the company s loan portfolio 
the following two tables set forth the changes in the allowance and an allocation of the allowance by loan category at the dates indicated 
total net loan charge offs increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal net mortgage and commercial real estate loan charge offs totaled million in fiscal compared with net charge offs of million in fiscal included in real estate charge offs was a  loss incurred which had been specifically reserved during fiscal consumer loan net charge offs were million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal consumer loan charge offs increased as a result of growth in consumer loans and a continuation of higher net charge off rates on auto loans and mobile homes 
underwriting standards were tightened in late fiscal on certain auto lending programs 
commercial business loan net charge offs were million in fiscal compared with  i n net charge offs in fiscal the company experienced charge offs on a number of larger commercial business loans in management believes that the allowance can be allocated by category only on an approximate basis 
the allocation of the allowance to each category is not necessarily indicative of future losses and does not restrict the use of the allowance to absorb losses in any category

business deposits have in the past been a less significant source of funding 
the company has set strategic targets for net growth in retail and business transaction accounts annually and in numbers of households served 
the company believes that its future focus must be on increasing the number of available opportunities to provide a broad array of products and services to retail consumers and to commercial customers 
new commercial business products have been developed and the company proactively seeks development of new business relationships 
during fiscal and in past years  the company has emphasized growing core deposits  particularly money market  checking and other such products with the goal of reducing its cost of funds 
the company s total deposits increased million during the year ended september  the company s deposit composition at september  and is as follows table deposits dollars in thousands at september  balance percent of total balance percent of total checking accounts   statement and other accounts   money market accounts   certificate accounts   total deposits   core deposits  which include checking accounts  statement and other accounts and money market accounts  grew by million in fiscal  or  while higher costing consumer certificate of deposit balances declined by million 
as of september  and  deposits as a percentage of liabilities were 
the company expects to maintain a significant portion of its deposits in core account relationships  however  future growth in deposit balances may be achieved primarily through specifically targeted programs offering higher yielding investment alternatives to consumers 
such targeted programs may increase the company s overall cost of funds and thus affect the company s future net margins 
the company s average cost of deposits at september  was compared with at september  borrowings borrowings increased million during the current year to million as of september  borrowings as a percentage of total liabilities were approximately at the end of fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
borrowings from the fhlb of atlanta increased million and other short term borrowings declined million 
the company s average cost of fhlb advances  reverse repurchase agreements and other borrowings declined from at september  to at september  approximately million in fhlb advances mature within one year 
other advances are subject to call during the next months but  based on the current market interest rates  these calls will likely not be exercised by the fhlb

total equity capital decreased from million at september  to million at september  the company s capital ratio of total capital to total assets  was at september  compared to at september  the company s tangible capital ratio at september  was compared with at september  recent stock repurchases included the purchase of approximately  shares   shares and  shares of common stock in fiscal  and  respectively

the association is required to meet the regulatory capital requirements of the ots  which currently include several measures of capital 
under current regulations  first federal meets all requirements including those to be categorized as well capitalized under risk based capital guidelines 
current capital distribution regulations of the ots allow the greatest flexibility to well capitalized institutions 
asset and liability management asset liability management is the process by which the company constantly changes the mix  maturity and pricing of assets and liabilities in an attempt to reduce a materially adverse impact on earnings resulting from the direction  frequency and magnitude of change in market interest rates 
although the net interest income of any financial institution is perceived as being vulnerable to fluctuations in interest rates  the company s management has attempted to minimize that vulnerability 
the company  working principally through the asset and liability committee of the association  has established policies and monitors results to control interest rate risk 
the company utilizes measures such as static and dynamic gap  which are measurements of the differences between interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities repricing for a particular time period including modeling that includes and excludes loan prepayment assumptions 
more important may be the process of evaluating how particular assets and liabilities are affected by changes in interest rates or selected indices as they reprice 
asset liability modeling is performed by the company to assess varying interest rate and balance sheet mix assumptions 
management may adjust the company s interest rate sensitivity position primarily through decisions on the pricing  maturity and marketing of particular deposit and loan products and by decisions regarding the structure and maturities of fhlb advances and other borrowings 
the company has continued to emphasize adjustable rate mortgage real estate lending and short term consumer and commercial business lending to accomplish its objectives 
the following table sets forth in summary form the repricing attributes of the company s interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
the time periods in the table represent the time period before an asset or liability matures or can be repriced 
table interest rate sensitivity analysis at september  dollars in thousands interest rate sensitivity period months months months months years over years cost interest earning assets loans      mortgage backed securities     interest earning deposits  investments and fhlb stock    total interest earning assets      interest bearing liabilities deposits checking accounts       savings accounts       money market accounts   certificate accounts      total deposits       borrowings      total interest bearing liabilities     current period gap      cumulative gap      percent of total assets assumptions fixed rate loans are shown in the time frame corresponding to contractual principal amortization schedules 
adjustable rate loans are shown in the time frame corresponding to the next contractual interest rate adjustment date 
the fixed and variable rate loans shown also take into account the company estimates of prepayments of fixed rate loans 
decay rates for checking accounts approximate in the first year and in the second year 
decay rates for savings accounts approximate in the first year and in the second year 
borrowings include fixed rate fhlb advances at the earlier of maturity date or expected call dates 
for purposes of the table above  the company has assumed under current interest rates  that advances with call provisions will extend 
based on the company s september  dynamic gap position  which considers expected prepayments of loans  in a one year time period billion in interest earning assets will reprice and approximately million in interest bearing liabilities will reprice 
this current dynamic gap position results in a positive one year gap position of million  or of assets 
the company s one year dynamic gap position at september  was a positive million  or of assets 
the above table does not take into consideration the repricing dynamics in adjustable rate loans  such as minimum and maximum annual and lifetime interest rate adjustments and also the index utilized and whether the index is a current or lagging index 
included in the above numbers are the company s estimates of prepayments of fixed rate loans and mortgage backed securities in a one year period and the company s expectation that under current interest rates  certain a dvances of the fhlb will not be called 
during the past five years the company extended maturities of interest sensitive assets through retention of certain types of loans  particularly those originated under newer hybrid lending programs with both fixed rate and variable rate features 
these loans have become very popular with consumers and carry a fixed rate of interest for three  five  or seven years and then adjust annually to an established index 
under current lower levels of market interest rates  during fiscal and  the pace of prepayments increased substantially on these types of loans as consumers locked into longer term fixed rate loans  which the company generally has sold 
under normal economic conditions  a negative gap would suggest that net interest income would increase if market rates declined 
a rise in market rates would normally have a detrimental effect on net interest income based on a negative gap 
the opposite would generally occur when an institution has a positive gap position 
as market interest rates declined during fiscal through actions of the federal reserve  the company s negative gap position at that time was a factor in increasing the net interest margin 
fiscal witnessed consistently low absolute levels of market interest rates 
it may be difficult to quantify expectations when interest rates are expected to continue at very low historic levels  as we are currently experiencing 
a continuation at these very low interest rates for another months or further declines in market interest rates would be expected to adversely affect the company s net interest margin because core deposit accounts may have already priced to potential floor levels while loans which are generally priced to a lagging index may continue to adjust to lower rates 
derivatives and hedging activities derivative transactions may be used by the company to better manage its interest rate sensitivity to reduce risks associated with its lending  deposit taking  and borrowing activities 
the company recognizes all derivatives as either assets or liabilities on the consolidated balance sheet and reports these instruments at fair value with realized and unrealized gains and losses included in either earnings or in other comprehensive income  depending on the purpose for which the derivative is used and whether the derivative qualifies for hedge accounting in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
by using derivative instruments  the company is exposed to credit and market risk 
credit risk  which is the risk that the counterparty to a derivative instrument will fail to perform  is equal to the extent of the fair value gain in a derivative 
credit risk is created when the fair value of a derivative contract is positive  since this generally indicates that the counterparty owes the company 
when the fair value of the derivative contract is negative  no credit risk exists since the company would owe the counterparty 
the company minimizes the credit risk in derivative instruments by entering into transactions with high quality counterparties as evaluated by management 
market risk is the adverse effect on the value of a financial instrument from a change in interest rates or implied volatility of interest rates 
we manage the market risk associated with interest rate contracts by establishing and monitoring limits as to the types and degree of risk that may be undertaken 
the market risk associated with derivatives used for interest rate risk management activity is fully incorporated into our interest rate sensitivity analysis 
at september   the fair value of derivative assets totaled  and was related to commitments to originate fixed rate loans held for sale and forward sales commitments 
the company s derivative and hedging activities are discussed in further detail in note of notes to consolidated financial statements contained in item herein 
off balance sheet arrangements in the normal course of operations  the company engages in a variety of financial transactions that  in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  are not recorded in the financial statements  or are recorded in amounts that differ from the notional amounts 
these transactions involve  to varying degrees  elements of credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk 
such transactions are used by the company for general corporate purposes or for customer needs 
corporate purpose transactions are used to help manage credit  interest rate  and liquidity risk or to optimize capital 
customer transactions are used to manage customers requests for funding 
the company s off balance sheet arrangements  which principally include lending commitments and derivatives  are described below 
at september  and  the company had no interests in non consolidated special purpose entities 
lending commitments lending commitments include loan commitments  standby letters of credit and unused business credit card lines 
these instruments are not recorded in the consolidated balance sheet until funds are advanced under the commitments 
the company provides these lending commitments to customers in the normal course of business 
for commercial customers  loan commitments generally take the form of revolving credit arrangements to finance customers working capital requirements 
for retail customers  loan commitments are generally lines of credit secured by residential property 
at september   commercial and retail loan commitments totaled million 
standby letters of credit totaled million 
standby letters of credit are conditional commitments to guarantee performance  typically of a contract or the financial integrity  of a customer to a third party 
unused business  personal and credit card lines  which totaled million at september   are generally for short term borrowings 
first financial applies essentially the same credit policies and standards as it does in the lending process when making these commitments 
see note to consolidated financial statements in item hereof for additional information regarding lending commitments 
derivatives in accordance with sfas no 
 the company records derivatives at fair value  as either assets or liabilities  on the consolidated balance sheets 
derivative transactions are measured in terms of the notional amount  but this amount is not recorded on the balance sheet and is not  when viewed in isolation  a meaningful measure of the risk profile of the instrument 
the notional amount is not exchanged  but is used only as the basis upon which interest and other payments are calculated 
see note to consolidated financial statements in item hereof for additional information regarding derivatives 
liquidity the desired level of liquidity for the company is determined by management in conjunction with the asset liability committee of the association 
the level of liquidity is based on management s strategic direction for the company  commitments to make loans and the committee s assessment of the association s ability to generate funds 
historically  sources of liquidity have included net deposits to savings accounts  amortizations and prepayments of loans  fhlb advances  reverse repurchase agreements and sales of securities and loans held for sale 
proper liquidity management is crucial to ensure that the company is able to take advantage of new business opportunities as well as meet the demands of its customers 
in this process  we focus on assets and liabilities and on the manner in which they combine to provide adequate liquidity to meet our needs 
the table below summarizes future contractual obligations as of september  contractual obligations table contractual obligations in thousands at september  payments due by period over one over two over three within one to two to three to five after five year years years years years total certificate accounts      borrowings      operating leases    total contractual obligations     the company s most stable and traditional source of funding has been the attraction and retention of deposit accounts  the success of which the company believes is based primarily on the strength and reputation of the association  effective marketing and rates paid on deposit accounts 
first federal has a major market share of deposits in charleston  berkeley and dorchester counties and a significant share of deposits in the georgetown  horry and florence counties 
as a relatively new entrant into beaufort county  south carolina to brunswick county  north carolina  the company holds a small but growing market share 
by continuing to promote innovative new products  pricing competitively and encouraging the highest level of quality in customer service  the company continues to successfully meet challenges from competitors  many of which are non banking entities offering investment products 
other primary sources of funds include borrowings from the fhlb  principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities  reverse repurchase agreements and sales of loans 
to minimize vulnerability  the association has back up sources of funds available  including fhlb borrowing capacity and securities available for sale 
during fiscal  the fhlb of atlanta instituted a general policy of limiting borrowing capacity to a percent of assets  regardless of the level of advances that could be supported by available collateral for such advances 
this new policy serves to define an upper cap for fhlb advances for the association of approximately million at september   based on its current approved cap 
should it be desired  the association may request an increase in the cap level up to of assets  subject to standard lending policies in effect at the fhlb 
during  the company experienced a net cash outflow from investing activities of million  consisting principally of purchases of million in mortgage backed securities available for sale and million in net purchases of investment securities available for sale partially offset by the proceeds from sales and repayments on mortgage backed securities available for sale of million  proceeds from the maturity of investments available for sale of million and a decrease of million in net loans 
significant operating activities of the company for fiscal included million of residential loans originated for sale with sales of million 
based on a net increase in deposits of million  higher payments and prepayments of mortgage backed securities and slower growth in loans attributable to sales  the company reduced other borrowing sources by million during the year ended september  proceeds from the sale of loans of million in fiscal increased significantly from million in fiscal based on recent asset liability management objectives and low historical interest rates  management expects to continue its strategy of selling selected longer term  fixed rate loans in fiscal management  however  anticipates volume of loan sales will be materially lower during fiscal as refinancing activity declines 
the company will likely increase its holdings of investments and mortgage backed securities during fiscal until loan portfolio growth returns to historical levels 
parent company liquidity as a holding company  first financial conducts its business through its subsidiaries 
unlike the association  first financial is not subject to any regulatory liquidity requirements 
potential sources for first financial s payment of principal and interest on its borrowings and for its periodic repurchase programs include i dividends from first federal and other subsidiaries  ii payments from existing cash reserves and sales of marketable securities  and iii interest on its investment securities 
as of september   first financial had cash reserves and existing marketable securities of million compared with million at september  the association s ability to pay dividends and make other capital contributions to first financial is restricted by regulation and may require regulatory approval 
such distributions may also depend on the association s ability to meet minimum regulatory capital requirements in effect during the period 
current ots regulations permit institutions meeting certain capital requirements and subject to normal supervision to pay out of net income to date over the calendar year and of surplus capital existing at the beginning of the calendar year without supervisory approval 
the association is currently subject to normal supervision as to the payment of dividends 
results of operations net interest income the largest component of operating earnings for the company is net interest income 
one of the company s strategic initiatives has been to reduce the company s reliance on net interest income through expansion of other sources of revenues 
net interest income totaled million in fiscal compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal net interest income represented approximately of the gross income of first financial in fiscal compared with in fiscal and in fiscal the level of net interest income is determined by balances of earning assets and successfully managing the net interest margin 
changes in interest rates paid on assets and liabilities  the rate of growth of the asset and liability base  the ratio of interest earning assets to interest bearing liabilities and management of the balance sheet s interest rate sensitivity all factor into changes in net interest income 
the absolute l evel of market interest rates also significantly affects the company s ability to quickly react to balance sheet changes 
net interest income decreased by to million in fiscal this followed an increase of in fiscal and in fiscal the decrease in fiscal was principally a result of a continuing decline in average yields on interest earning assets relative to the reduction in the average cost of interest bearing liabilities 
as short term market interest rates declined  the company s interest sensitive liabilities repriced to an average cost of in fiscal from an average cost of in fiscal average yields declined to in fiscal from in fiscal the company s net interest margin decreased in fiscal to from in fiscal economic conditions  market interest rates and competitive pressures in fiscal were less challenging than in fiscal when the federal reserve was moving interest rates to higher levels to combat the threat of higher growth in inflation 
the company s average cost of interest bearing liabilities declined to in fiscal from in fiscal average yields on interest earning assets decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the net interest margin increased substantially to in from in fiscal while the net interest margin during fiscal declined only marginally  by basis points  more importantly  the net interest margin was during the quarter ended september   experiencing a decline from during the quarter ended june  management expects continued pressure on its net interest margin as a result of the amortization and maturities of loans and investment and mortgage backed securities and the need to reinvest those funds at current market interest rates

this computation includes interest earning deposits  which are classified as cash equivalents in the company s consolidated statements of financial condition contained in item herein 
the company s weighted average yield on earning assets and weighted average cost of interest bearing liabilities shown above are derived by dividing interest income and expense by the weighted average balances of interest earning assets or interest bearing liabilities 
during fiscal  the average yield on interest earning assets declined by basis points while the average rate paid on average interest bearing liabilities declined by basis points 
average interest earning assets decreased million in fiscal while interest bearing liabilities decreased million 
this in conjunction with the average yield on interest bearing assets and liabilities decreasing about the same number of basis points provided for a slight decrease in gross margin 
the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense attributable to changes in volume and the amount attributable to changes in rate 
the combined effect of changes in both volume and rate  which cannot be separately identified  has been allocated proportionately to the change as a result of volume and rate

in fiscal the company s provision expense was million compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the provision was higher in fiscal than in fiscal and again in fiscal than in fiscal principally as a result of higher consumer loan charge offs as a result of planned expansion of the consumer lending base  and other incremental changes in components of the loan portfolio offset by reductions in classified credits and an overall reduction in net loans 
as a result of these actions  the allowance for loan losses was million and million at september  and  respectively  and represented 
of net loans at the end of fiscal and net charge offs in fiscal totaled million  or 
of average net loans  compared with million in fiscal  or 
of average net loans 
net loan charge offs of million in resulted in charge offs to average loans of 
charge offs increased in all three fiscal periods as a result of increasing levels of consumer loan charge offs related to higher bankruptcies  higher levels of delinquencies and continued slower economic growth 
other income other income increased by million  or  in fiscal to million from million in fiscal principal increases in fiscal included higher commissions and other revenues from insurance agency operations  increasing million  and improved net gains on loan sales  increasing million 
insurance revenues grew from expansion of activities through the acquisition of additional agency operations 
insurance revenues are now the single largest source of other revenues and growth in insurance revenues in fiscal was principally attributable to the inclusion of johnson insurance for a full year versus one and one half months in fiscal as well as the acquisition of other insurance operations during fiscal contingent performance based insurance revenues totaled approximately million in fiscal and fiscal  comprising of insurance revenues in and of revenues in fiscal higher gains from loan sales were attributable to increased originations and sales of fixed rate single family loans as a result of historically low interest rates throughout the year 
the company anticipates that gains from loan sales will be materially lower during fiscal gains from sales of investment and mortgage backed securities of million during fiscal increased million over fiscal although revenues from non banking activities have expanded in recent years  another significant component of other income remains service charges and fees on deposit accounts 
comprising of other income in fiscal  of other income in fiscal and in fiscal  respectively  service charges and fees on deposit accounts improved to million in fiscal from million in fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in over as well as the increase during over were directly attributable to sales efforts to grow checking accounts and expansion of business checking relationships 
loan servicing fees were reported at million in fiscal   in fiscal and million during revenues declined during fiscal compared with fiscal principally due to an impairment reserve of  against the carrying value of originated mortgage servicing rights 
during fiscal  changes in the impairment reserve resulted in additional income of  loan servicing fees  however  remained at lower levels during fiscal partially as a result of higher loan prepayment speeds  resulting in increased amortizations of the company s originated mortgage servicing asset 
the amortization of servicing rights increased to million during fiscal from million during fiscal the company estimates the amortization of its originated servicing asset recorded at september   will likely approximate million during fiscal should market interest rates decline from current levels  it is lik ely the company could incur an additional impairment in its mortgage servicing asset and also incur increased amortizations of the servicing asset  both of which will result in lowering future servicing revenues 
the company incurred losses of  and  respectively  from real estate operations and other repossession costs during fiscal and operations from real estate operations decreased substantially in these years from a gain of  in fiscal the decrease from fiscal to fiscal was principally related to the decrease in sales of real estate and an increase in provisions charged as a write down to real estate 
non interest expense in the more competitive financial services market of recent years  management has recognized the importance of controlling non interest expense to maintain and improve profitability 
management also recognizes that there are operational costs which continue to increase as a result of the present operating climate for regulated financial institutions 
the technical and operating environment for financial institutions continues to require a well trained and motivated staff  superior operating systems and sophisticated marketing efforts

the largest component of non interest expense  salaries and employee benefits  increased million  or  to million in fiscal staffing for kinghorn for a full year versus only four months in fiscal  four additional retail sales offices and increases in incentive compensation payments resulted in higher costs 
in fiscal  occupancy costs increased to million 
in fiscal  occupancy costs increased to million principally as a result of additional leased facilities at the insurance agencies 
equipment costs increased  or  during fiscal  following a similar increase of  or in fiscal these increases are attributable to a higher number of banking and insurance offices in fiscal and fiscal in addition  first financial has invested heavily in new technology in recent fiscal years 
such investments include imaging systems  improved voice response technology  lending and deposit platform system enhancements  branch office automation systems and telecommunication upgrades 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company converted to jack henry s silverlake core banking application software 
this project resulted in some duplicative equipment expenses during fiscal as the project began in the fall of costs were also marginally higher in fiscal as the company worked to complete the systems consolidation of the operations of first federal and peoples federal into one operating unit

the amortization of intangibles associated with insurance agency acquisitions totaled  in fiscal compared with  in fiscal and  in fiscal the amortization of goodwill totaled  in fiscal with no corresponding amortization in fiscal or higher professional fees and other expenses were incurred in fiscal and fiscal and increased levels of business activity  including additional insurance operations  resulted in higher operating expense  particularly as a full year of operations of kinghorn was included in fiscal and a full year of johnson s operations were included in fiscal other expenses during fiscal included a  write off of assets related to the company s previous core processing system 
during fiscal  the company incurred expenses of approximately  related to the settlement of litigation 
the company s efficiency ratio was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal management continues to target lower expense ratios as an important strategic goal of the company 
during the last two years  the company has increased its acquisitions of companies that generate higher levels of non interest revenues 
insurance agencies typically have higher efficiency ratios than traditional banking operations 
the company believes that the relatively flat trend in the efficiency ratio is an indicator of lower efficiency ratios in its traditional banking activities  which has benefited significantly from higher mortgage banking activity

interest rates do not necessarily move in the same direction or in the same magnitude as the price of goods and services since such prices are affected by inflation 
the company is committed to continuing to actively manage the gap between its interest sensitive assets and interest sensitive liabilities
