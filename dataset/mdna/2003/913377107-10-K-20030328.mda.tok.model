introduction the following analysis of our consolidated results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and related consolidated footnotes included elsewhere 
we own nine insurance companies collectively  the insurance subsidiaries american progressive life health insurance company of new york american progressive  american pioneer life insurance company american pioneer  american exchange life insurance company american exchange  constitution life insurance company constitution  marquette national life insurance company marquette  peninsular life insurance company peninsular  pennsylvania life insurance company pennsylvania life  penncorp life insurance company penncorp life canada and union bankers insurance company union bankers 
the insurance company subsidiaries are licensed to sell life and accident and health insurance in all fifty states  the district of columbia and all the provinces of canada 
in addition to the insurance subsidiaries  we own a third party administrator  chcs services  inc  that administers senior market business for more than unaffiliated insurance companies  as well as our own companies 
overview our principal business segments are career agency  senior market brokerage and administrative services 
we also report the corporate activities of our holding company in a separate segment 
during we modified the way we report segment information by combining our previously defined senior market brokerage and special markets segments into one segment  senior market brokerage 
our decision to combine the two segments was based on the significant reduction in the insurance in force in the special markets segment as a result of our exit from the major medical line of business 
reclassifications have been made to conform prior year amounts to the current year presentation 
a description of these segments follows career agency the career agency segment is comprised of the operations of pennsylvania life and penncorp life canada  both of which we acquired in penncorp life canada operates exclusively in canada  while pennsylvania life operates in the united states 
the career agency segment includes the operations of a career agency field force  which distributes fixed benefit accident and sickness disability insurance  life insurance  supplemental senior health insurance and annuities in the united states and canada 
the career agents are under exclusive contract with either pennsylvania life or penncorp life canada 
senior market brokerage this segment includes the operations of our other insurance subsidiaries  primarily american pioneer  american progressive and constitution  that distribute senior market products through general agency and brokerage distribution systems 
the products include medicare supplement select  long term care  senior life insurance and annuities 
in  we combined our special markets segment with our senior market brokerage segment 
administrative services chcs services  inc acts as a third party administrator and service provider for both affiliated and unaffiliated insurance companies  primarily with respect to senior market insurance products and non insurance products 
the services that we perform include policy underwriting and issuance  telephone and face to face verification  policyholder services  claims adjudication  case management  care assessment and referral to health care facilities 
corporate this segment reflects the activities of our holding company  including the payment of interest on our debt  certain senior executive compensation  and the expense of being a public company 
intersegment revenues and expenses are reported on a gross basis in each of the operating segments 
these intersegment revenue and expenses affect the amounts reported on the individual financial statement line items  but are eliminated in consolidation and do not change operating income before taxes 
the significant items eliminated include intersegment revenue and expense relating to services performed by the administrative services segment for the career agency and senior market brokerage segments and interest on notes issued by the corporate segment to the other operating segments 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with gaap requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of assets and liabilities reported by us at the date of the financial statements and the revenues and expenses reported during the reporting period 
as additional information becomes available or actual amounts become determinable  the recorded estimates may be revised and reflected in operating results 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
accounts that  in our judgment  are most critical to the preparation of our financial statements include policy liabilities and accruals  deferred policy acquisition costs  valuation of certain investments and deferred taxes 
policy liabilities and accruals we calculate and maintain reserves for the estimated future payment of claims to our policyholders using the same actuarial assumptions that we use in the pricing of our products 
for our accident and health insurance business  we establish an active life reserve plus a liability for due and unpaid claims  claims in the course of settlement and incurred but not reported claims  as well as a reserve for the present value of amounts not yet due on claims 
many factors can affect these reserves and liabilities  such as economic and social conditions  inflation  hospital and pharmaceutical costs  changes in doctrines of legal liability and extracontractual damage awards 
therefore  the reserves and liabilities we establish are based on extensive estimates  assumptions and prior years statistics 
when we acquire other insurance companies or blocks of insurance  our assessment of the adequacy of transferred policy liabilities is subject to similar estimates and assumptions 
establishing reserves is an uncertain process  and it is possible that actual claims will materially exceed our reserves and have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our net income depends significantly upon the extent to which our actual claims experience is consistent with the assumptions we used in setting our reserves and pricing our policies 
if our assumptions with respect to future claims are incorrect  and our reserves are insufficient to cover our actual losses and expenses  we would be required to increase our liabilities resulting in reduced net income and shareholders equity 
deferred policy acquisition costs the cost of acquiring new business  principally commissions and certain expenses of the agency  policy issuance  underwriting and related departments  all of which vary with  and are primarily related to the production of new and renewal business  have been deferred 
these costs are being amortized in relation to the present value of expected gross profits on the policies arising principally from investment  mortality and expense margins in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises for certain long duration contracts and for realized gains and losses from the sale of investments  for interest sensitive life and annuity products and in proportion to premium revenue using the same assumptions used in estimating the liabilities for future policy benefits in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting and reporting by insurance enterprises  for non interest sensitive life and all accident health products 
the determination of gross profits is an inherently uncertain process  and relies on assumptions including the persistency of the policies issued as well as anticipated benefits  commissions and expenses 
it is possible that the actual profits from the business will vary materially from the assumptions used in the determination and amortization of deferred acquisition costs 
deferred policy acquisition costs are written off to the extent that it is determined that future policy premiums and investment income or gross profits would not be adequate to cover related losses and expenses 
investment valuation fair value of investments is based upon quoted market prices  where available  or on values obtained from independent pricing services 
for certain mortgage and asset backed securities  the determination of fair value is based primarily upon the amount and timing of expected future cash flows of the security 
estimates of these cash flows are based upon current economic conditions  past credit loss experience and other circumstances 
we regularly evaluate the amortized cost of our investments compared to the fair value of those investments 
impairments of securities generally are recognized when a decline in fair value below the amortized cost basis is considered to be other than temporary 
generally  we consider a decline in fair value to be other than temporary when the fair value of an individual security is below amortized cost for an extended period and we do not believe that recovery in fair value is probable 
impairment losses for certain mortgage and asset backed securities are recognized when an adverse change in the amount or timing of estimated cash flows occurs  unless the adverse change is solely a result of changes in estimated market interest rates 
the cost basis for securities determined to be impaired are reduced to their fair value  with the excess of the cost basis over the fair value recognized as a realized investment loss 
deferred taxes we use the asset and liability method to account for deferred income taxes 
under the asset and liability method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date of a change in tax rates 
we establish valuation allowances on our deferred tax assets for amounts that we determine will not be recoverable based upon our analysis of projected taxable income and our ability to implement prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
increases in these valuation allowances are recognized as deferred tax expense 
subsequent determinations that portions of the valuation allowances are no longer necessary are reflected as deferred tax benefits 
to the extent that valuation allowances were established in conjunction with acquisitions  changes in those allowances are first applied to increasing or decreasing the goodwill but not below zero or other intangibles related to the acquisition and then applied as an increase or decrease in income tax expense 
acquisitions  divestitures and financing activity pending acquisition in december  pennsylvania life entered into a definitive contract to acquire pyramid life insurance company pyramid life from ceres group  inc for million in cash 
this transaction is subject to regulatory approvals and other customary conditions and is scheduled to close by the end of the first quarter of pyramid life specializes in providing health and life insurance products to the senior market 
these products include medicare supplement  long term care  life insurance  and annuities

as of the end of  pyramid life had approximately million of premium in force and in excess of million of assets 
during  pyramid life agents produced more than million of annualized new sales 
we believe this acquisition will add further scale and efficiencies to our operations in the rapidly expanding senior market 
following a transition period  we plan to take advantage of our cost effective and efficient service center to administer the business  however  we will preserve the marketing identity and quality service that has defined pyramid life

this acquisition strengthened our expertise and capacity to administer senior market products 
acquisition in july  we acquired six insurance companies  including the subsidiaries that comprise our career agency segment  and other assets from penncorp financial group 
this acquisition enhanced our prospects for future growth by expanding our geographic reach and through the addition of a career agency marketing channel to supplement our senior market brokerage agency marketing channel 
cancellation of major medical insurance in the fourth quarter of  we decided to exit our under performing individual major medical business to the extent possible 
of the million of individual major medical premium that was in force on december   approximately million remained in force on december   which we are not able to cancel 
health maintenance organization hmo s dis enrollment beginning in  many hmo s realized that their medicare programs were unprofitable and  therefore  decided to terminate these programs 
as a result  millions of seniors were involuntarily dis enrolled from these programs 
this development contributed to our increased new sales of medicare supplement products in and under applicable legislation  such dis enrollees had the right to acquire medicare supplement insurance without medical underwriting or pre existing condition limitations 
as we expected  during new sales of our medicare products have slowed since the hmo s are not dis enrolling members as much as they were in prior years 
to offset this impact  we have continued to expand geographically  and we have stepped up recruiting effort to augment our production 
additionally  we have increased our retention on new medicare supplement business 
as a result  we believe that we will continue to grow our net premiums

liquidity and capital resources our capital is used primarily to support the retained risks and growth of our insurance company and administrative service subsidiaries and to support our parent company as an insurance holding company 
in addition  we use capital to fund our anticipated growth through acquisitions of other companies or blocks of insurance or administrative service business 
we require cash at our parent company to meet our obligations under our credit facility and our outstanding debentures held by our subsidiaries  american progressive and pennsylvania life 
in january  our parent company issued a debenture to pennsylvania life in conjunction with the transfer of the business of pennsylvania life s canadian branch to penncorp life canada 
repayment of the debenture is anticipated to be funded from dividends from penncorp life canada 
we also require cash to pay the operating expenses necessary to function as a holding company applicable insurance department regulations require us to bear our own expenses  and to meet the costs of being a public company 
we believe that our current cash position  the availability of the revolving credit facility  the expected cash flows of our administrative service company and the surplus note interest payments from american exchange as explained below can support our parent company obligations for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurance as to our actual future cash flows or to the continued availability of dividends from our insurance company subsidiaries 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments our current credit facility consists of a term loan and a million revolving loan facility 
the loans call for interest at libor for one  two  three or six months plus basis points beginning january  
principal payments are due on a quarterly basis over a seven year period that commenced on july  the final maturity date of the facility is july  we pay a commitment fee of basis points on the unutilized portion of the revolving facility  which is currently million 
the term loan is secured by a first priority security interest in of the outstanding common stock of american exchange  american progressive  and worldnet services and of the outstanding common stock of uafc canada inc the parent of penncorp life canada and a subordinate interest in of the outstanding common stock of american pioneer 
as of december   million was outstanding under the term loan and million was outstanding under the revolving loan facility 
we incurred the revolving indebtedness in connection with our acquisition of chcs in august during january  we made a regularly scheduled principal repayment that further reduced the outstanding balance of the term loan to million 
during  we paid million in interest and repaid million in principal on the term loan 
for  we paid million in interest and repaid million in principal on the term loan

the following table shows the schedule of remaining principal payments in thousands on the company s outstanding term loan  with the final payment in july total  in connection with the pending acquisition of pyramid life  we intend to refinance the above term loan 
we anticipate that our new credit facility will total million  consisting of a million five year term loan with a million revolver 
we intend to use the proceeds from the term loan along with existing cash to repay the existing term loan and finance the acquisition of pyramid life 
the refinancing  if consummated  would trigger the immediate amortization of the capitalized loan origination fees from the existing term loan resulting in an pre tax expense of approximately million

equity offering on july   the company entered into an underwriting agreement with banc of america securities llc and raymond james associates  inc  as representatives of the underwriters named therein  and certain shareholders of the company  with respect to the sale of up to  shares of the company s common stock including  shares of common stock subject to an over allotment option granted to the underwriters by the company and some of the selling shareholders

a portion of the proceeds from our equity offering in july was used to pay down million of the debentures 
a scheduled redemption of million was made in december  leaving a balance at december  of million  which is due in may our holding company pays interest on the outstanding debentures quarterly at a rate of 
during our parent holding company paid million in interest on these debentures to american progressive  million in and million in the interest on these debentures is eliminated in consolidation 
in january  our parent company issued a debenture in the amount of million to pennsylvania life in connection with the transfer of the business of pennsylvania life s canadian branch to penncorp life canada 
our parent company paid million in principal during  reducing the outstanding balance to million at december  principal and interest payments are made quarterly 
the debenture is scheduled to be repaid in full by the third quarter of during  our parent holding company paid million in interest on these debentures 
the interest on these debentures is eliminated in consolidation 
dividends from penncorp life canada funded the interest and principal paid on the debenture in and it is anticipated that they will fund all future payments made on this debenture 
administrative service company liquidity for our administrative service company is measured by its ability to pay operating expenses 
the primary source of liquidity is fees collected from clients 
we believe that the sources of cash for our administrative service company exceed scheduled uses of cash and results in amounts available to dividend to our parent holding company 
we measure the ability of the administrative service company to pay dividends based on its earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization ebitda 
ebitda for our administrative services segment was million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  insurance subsidiary surplus note cash generated by our insurance company subsidiaries will be made available to our holding company  principally through periodic payments of principal and interest on surplus notes 
as of december   the principal amount of surplus notes owed to our holding company from our american exchange subsidiary was million 
the notes pay interest to our parent holding company at libor plus basis points 
we anticipate that the surplus notes will be primarily serviced by dividends from pennsylvania life  a wholly owned subsidiary of american exchange  and by tax sharing payments among the insurance companies that are wholly owned by american exchange and file a consolidated federal income tax return 
during  the surplus note was reduced by million in the form of a capital contribution to american exchange by our holding company 
no principal payments were made during or during  american exchange paid million in interest on the surplus notes to our parent holding company  million in and million in during  pennsylvania life paid cash dividends amounting to million to american exchange 
universal american contributed the of the common stock of american pioneer and american progressive to american exchange during american exchange also received capital contributions from its parent totaling million during the year 
american exchange made capital contributions of million to american pioneer and million to american progressive during during  union bankers paid cash dividends amounting to million to american exchange 
in addition  the insurance companies included in the tax allocation agreement with american exchange paid million in tax sharing payments to american exchange 
in connection with the equity offering discussed above  american exchange received million in capital contributions from its parent 
during  american exchange made cash capital contributions of million to pennsylvania life 
during  pennsylvania life paid million and union bankers paid million in dividends to american exchange 
in addition  the insurance companies included in the tax allocation agreement with american exchange paid million in tax sharing payments to american exchange 
insurance subsidiaries our insurance subsidiaries are required to maintain minimum amounts of capital and surplus as determined by statutory accounting practices 
as of december   each insurance company subsidiary s statutory capital and surplus exceeded its respective minimum requirement 
however  substantially more than these minimum amounts are needed to meet statutory and administrative requirements of adequate capital and surplus to support the current level of our insurance subsidiaries operations 
as of december  the statutory capital and surplus  including asset valuation reserves  of our us domiciled insurance subsidiaries totaled million 
the national association of insurance commissioners has developed  and state insurance regulators have adopted  risk based capital requirements on life insurance enterprises 
as of december  all of our insurance company subsidiaries maintained ratios of total adjusted capital to risk based capital in excess of the minimum trigger point for regulatory action 
penncorp life canada is subject to canadian capital requirements and report results to canadian regulatory authorities based upon canadian statutory accounting principles that vary in some respects from us statutory accounting principles 
canadian net assets based upon canadian statutory accounting principles were million as of december  penncorp life canada maintained a minimum continuing capital and surplus requirement ratio in excess of the minimum requirement as of december  dividend payments by our insurance companies to our parent holding company or to intermediate subsidiaries are limited by  or subject to the approval of the insurance regulatory authorities of each insurance company s state of domicile 
such dividend requirements and approval processes vary significantly from state to state 
the maximum amount of dividends which can be paid to american exchange from pennsylvania life to assist in servicing the surplus note held by american exchange without the prior approval of the pennsylvania department of insurance is restricted to the greater of of the pennsylvania life s surplus as regards policyholders as of the preceding december or the net gain from operations during the preceding year  but such dividends can be paid only out of unassigned surplus 
thus  future earnings of pennsylvania life would be available for dividends without prior approval  subject to the restrictions noted above 
based upon the current dividend regulations of pennsylvania  pennsylvania life would be able to pay ordinary dividends of up to million to american exchange its direct parent without the prior approval from pennsylvania department of insurance in additionally  it is anticipated that penncorp life canada would be able to pay ordinary dividends of up to million to universal american in we do not expect that our remaining regulated insurance subsidiaries will be able to pay ordinary dividends in liquidity for our insurance company subsidiaries is measured by their ability to pay scheduled contractual benefits  pay operating expenses  and fund investment commitments 
sources of liquidity include scheduled and unscheduled principal and interest payments on investments  premium payments and deposits and the sale of liquid investments 
we believe that these sources of cash for our insurance company subsidiaries exceed scheduled uses of cash 
liquidity is also affected by unscheduled benefit payments including death benefits  benefits under accident and health insurance policies and interest sensitive policy surrenders and withdrawals 
the amount of surrenders and withdrawals is affected by a variety of factors such as credited interest rates for similar products  general economic conditions and events in the industry that affect policyholders confidence 
although the contractual terms of substantially all of our in force life insurance policies and annuities give the holders the right to surrender the policies and annuities  we impose penalties for early surrenders 
as of december  we held reserves that exceeded the underlying cash surrender values of our in force life insurance and annuities by million 
our insurance subsidiaries  in our view  have not experienced any material changes in surrender and withdrawal activity in recent years 
changes in interest rates may affect the incidence of policy surrenders and withdrawals 
in addition to the potential impact on liquidity  unanticipated surrenders and withdrawals in a changed interest rate environment could adversely affect earnings if we were required to sell investments at reduced values in order to meet liquidity demands 
we manage our asset and liability portfolios in order to minimize the adverse earnings impact of changing market rates 
we seek to invest in assets that have duration and interest rate characteristics similar to the liabilities that they support 
the net yields on our cash and invested assets decreased from in to in a significant portion of these securities are held to support the liabilities for policyholder account balances  which liabilities are subject to periodic adjustments to their credited interest rates 
the credited interest rates of the interest sensitive policyholder account balances are determined by us based upon factors such as portfolio rates of return and prevailing market rates and typically follow the pattern of yields on the assets supporting these liabilities 
as of december   our insurance company subsidiaries held cash and cash equivalents totaling million  as well as fixed maturity securities that could readily be converted to cash with carrying values and fair values of million 
the fair values of these holdings totaled more than million as of december  investments our investment policy is to balance the portfolio duration to achieve investment returns consistent with the preservation of capital and maintenance of liquidity adequate to meet payment of policy benefits and claims 
we invest in assets permitted under the insurance laws of the various states in which we operate 
such laws generally prescribe the nature  quality of and limitations on various types of investments that may be made 
however  we do not invest in partnerships  special purpose entities  real estate  commodity contracts  or other derivative securities 
we currently engage the services of independent professional insurance investment advisors under the direction of the management of our insurance company subsidiaries and in accordance with guidelines adopted by the investment committees of their respective boards of directors 
conning asset management company manages our fixed maturity portfolio in the united states and mfc global investment management manages our canadian fixed maturity portfolio 
our policy is not to invest in derivative programs or other hybrid securities  except for gnma s  fnma s and investment grade corporate collateralized mortgage obligations 
we invest primarily in fixed maturity securities of the us government and its agencies and in corporate fixed maturity securities with investment grade ratings of baa moody s investor service  bbb standard poor s corporation or higher 
as of december   of our fixed maturity investments had investment grade ratings from moody s investors service or standard poor s corporation 
however  we do own some investments that are rated bb or below by standard poor s together of total fixed maturities as of december  
there were no non income producing fixed maturities for the year ended december  during the year ended december   we recognized other than temporary declines in the value of certain fixed maturity securities of million  primarily as a result of the impairment of our worldcom bonds  which were disposed of in the third quarter of at a price approximating their carrying value after recognition of the other than temporary decline 
we recognized other than temporary declines in the value of fixed maturity securities of million and during and million during in each case these represent our estimate of the other than temporary declines in value and were included in net realized gains losses on investments in our consolidated statements of operations 
federal income taxation of the company we file a consolidated return for federal income tax purposes  in which american exchange and the companies acquired in are not currently permitted to be included 
as of december  we exclusive of american exchange and the companies acquired in had net operating tax loss carryforwards of approximately million that expire in the years to as of december   we also had an alternative minimum tax amt credit carryforward for federal income tax purposes of approximately million that can be carried forward indefinitely 
as a result of the change in our ownership in july  use of most of our loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitations 
american exchange and the other u 
s 
companies acquired in file a separate consolidated federal income tax return 
as of december   these companies had net operating loss carryforwards  most of which were incurred prior to their acquisition by us  of approximately million that expire in the years to as a result of the change in the ownership of the companies acquired in  use of most of these loss carryforwards is subject to annual limitations 
as of december  and  we carried valuation allowances of million and million  respectively  with respect to our tax loss carryforwards deferred tax assets 
we determine a valuation allowance based upon an analysis of projected taxable income and our ability to implement prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
the tax planning strategies include the expense reductions anticipated from our recent reorganization and from the income generated by our administrative services companies 
as a result of the increased profitability of the insurance subsidiaries acquired in  valuation allowances on certain of the life tax loss carryforwards were considered not necessary at december  the amount of the valuation allowance released during was million and was recorded as a benefit in the deferred income tax expense 
as a result of the increased profitability of the administrative services segment  valuation allowances on certain of the non life tax loss carryforwards were considered not necessary as of december  the amount of the valuation allowance released during was million and was recorded as a benefit in the deferred income tax expense 
these decreases were partially offset by the establishment of a valuation allowance of million for certain capital losses incurred in by the company that are subject to limitation on their use 
we believe it is more likely than not that we will realize the recorded net deferred tax assets 
our us insurance company subsidiaries  other than peninsular life insurance company  are taxed as life insurance companies as provided in the internal revenue code 
the omnibus budget reconciliation act of amended the internal revenue code to require a portion of the expenses incurred in selling insurance products to be capitalized and amortized over a period of years  as opposed to an immediate deduction in the year incurred 
instead of measuring actual selling expenses  the amount capitalized for tax purposes is based on a percentage of premiums 
in general  the capitalized amounts are subject to amortization over a ten year period 
since this change only affects the timing of the deductions  it does not  assuming stability of rates  affect the provisions for taxes reflected in our financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap 
however  by deferring deductions  the change does have the effect of increasing the current tax expense  thereby reducing statutory surplus 
because of our insurance company subsidiaries net operating loss carryforwards  there was no material increase in our current income tax provision for any of the three years in the period ended december  due to this provision 
effects of recently issued accounting pronouncements in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas establishes an accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale that applies to all long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
sfas requires that those long lived assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell  whether reported in continuing operations or in discontinued operations 
the provisions of sfas are effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december  adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations sfas 
sfas eliminates the pooling of interests method of accounting for business combinations  requiring all business combinations to be accounted for under the purchase method 
accordingly  net assets acquired are recorded at fair value with any excess of cost over net assets assigned to goodwill 
sfas also requires that certain intangible assets acquired in a business combination be recognized apart from goodwill 
the provisions of sfas apply to all business combinations initiated after june  adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
under sfas  effective january  amortization of goodwill is precluded  however  its recoverability must be periodically at least annually reviewed and tested for impairment 
goodwill must be tested at the reporting unit level for impairment in the year of adoption  including an initial test performed within six months of adoption 
if the initial test indicates a potential impairment  then a more detailed analysis to determine the extent of impairment must be completed within twelve months of adoption 
during the first quarter of  the company completed the review and analysis of its goodwill asset in accordance with the provisions of sfas the result of these analyses indicated that each reporting unit s fair value exceeded its carrying amount  including goodwill 
as a result  goodwill for each reporting unit was not considered impaired 
sfas also requires that useful lives for intangibles other than goodwill be reassessed and remaining amortization periods be adjusted accordingly 
adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
the company updated its review of its good will assets during the fourth quarter of and determined that the goodwill asset remained unimpaired 
effective april   the company adopted emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained beneficial interests in securitized financial assets eitf 
under the consensus  investors in certain securities with contractual cash flows  primarily asset backed securities  are required to periodically update their best estimate of cash flows over the life of the security 
if the fair value of the securitized financial asset is less than its carrying amount and there has been a decrease in the present value of the estimated cash flows since the last revised estimate  considering both timing and amount  an other than temporary impairment charge is recognized 
the estimated cash flows are also used to evaluate whether there have been any changes in the securitized asset s estimated yield 
all yield adjustments are accounted for on a prospective basis 
adoption of eitf did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas  as amended by sfas nos 
and the standard requires  among other things  that all derivatives be carried on the balance sheet at fair value 
the standard also specifies hedge accounting criteria under which a derivative can qualify for special accounting 
in order to receive special accounting  the derivative instrument must qualify as a hedge of either the fair value or the variability of the cash flow of a qualified asset or liability  or forecasted transaction 
special accounting for qualifying hedges provides for matching the timing of gain or loss recognition on the hedging instrument with the recognition of the corresponding changes in value of the hedged item 
the company does not currently have any derivative instruments and therefore adoption of sfas did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial condition or results of operations 
pending accounting pronouncements in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas 
sfas requires any gain or loss on extinguishments of debt to be presented as a component of continuing operations unless specific criteria are met whereas sfas no 
required that such gains and losses be classified as an extraordinary item in determining net income 
the company will adopt these provisions on january   as required 
the other provisions of sfas no 
were not relevant to the company 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities including restructurings to be recognized when the costs are incurred  rather than at a date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this standard nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under sfas  a liability related to an exit or disposal activity is not recognized until such liability has actually been incurred whereas under eitf issue no 
a liability was recognized at the time of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of this standard are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the company will adopt this standard on january   as required 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas 
this standard amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
this standard also requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
as permitted by sfas  the company measured its stock based compensation using the intrinsic value approach under accounting principles board apb opinion no 
accordingly  the company did not recognize compensation expense upon the issuance of its stock options because the option terms were fixed and the exercise price equaled the market price of the underlying common stock on the grant date 
the company complied with the disclosure provisions of sfas by providing pro forma disclosures of net income and related per share data giving consideration to the fair value method provisions of sfas item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in general  market risk relates to changes in the value of financial instruments that arise from adverse movements in interest rates  equity prices and foreign exchange rates 
we are exposed principally to changes in interest rates that affect the market prices of our fixed income securities 
interest rate sensitivity our profitability could be affected if we were required to liquidate fixed income securities during periods of rising and or volatile interest rates 
however  we attempt to mitigate our exposure to adverse interest rate movements through a combination of active portfolio management and by staggering the maturities of our fixed income investments to assure sufficient liquidity to meet our obligations and to address reinvestment risk considerations 
our insurance liabilities generally arise over relatively long periods of time  which typically permits ample time to prepare for their settlement 
to date  we have not used various financial risk management tools on our investment securities  such as interest rate swaps  forwards  futures and options to modify our exposure to changes in interest rates 
however  we may consider using risk management tools in the future 
certain classes of mortgage backed securities are subject to significant prepayment risk due to the fact that in periods of declining interest rates  individuals may refinance higher rate mortgages to take advantage of the lower rates then available 
we monitor and adjust our investment portfolio mix to mitigate this risk 
we regularly conduct various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in interest rate on our financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect our assessment as being reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
the magnitude of changes modeled in the accompanying analyses should not be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather  be treated as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on our financial results 
the sensitivity analysis of interest rate risk assumes an instantaneous shift in a parallel fashion across the yield curve  with scenarios of interest rates increasing and decreasing and basis points from their levels as of december   and with all other variables held constant 
a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in a pre tax decrease in the market value of our fixed income investments of million and a basis point increase in market interest rates would result in million decrease 
similarly  a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in a pre tax increase in the market value of our fixed income investments of million and a basis point decrease in market interest rates would result in a million increase 
currency exchange rate sensitivity portions of our operations are transacted using the canadian dollar as the functional currency 
as of and for the year ended december   approximately of our assets  of our revenues  excluding realized gains  and of our operating income before taxes were derived from our canadian operations 
as of and for the year ended december   approximately of our assets  of our revenues  excluding realized gains  and of our operating income before taxes were derived from our canadian operations 
accordingly  our earnings and shareholder s equity are affected by fluctuations in the value of the us dollar as compared to the canadian dollar 
although this risk is somewhat mitigated by the fact that both the assets and liabilities for our foreign operations are denominated in canadian dollars  we are still subject to translation losses 
we periodically conduct various analyses to gauge the financial impact of changes in the foreign currency exchange rate on our financial condition 
the ranges selected in these analyses reflect our assessment of what is reasonably possible over the succeeding twelve month period 
as of december   a strengthening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in a decrease in our operating income before taxes of approximately million and a decrease in shareholders equity of approximately million 
a weakening of the us dollar relative to the canadian dollar would result in an increase in our operating income before taxes of approximately million and an increase in shareholders equity of approximately million 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in any potential change in sales levels  local prices or any other variables 
the magnitude of changes reflected in the above analysis regarding interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates should  in no manner  be construed as a prediction of future economic events  but rather as a simple illustration of the potential impact of such events on our financial results
