under fas  deferred tax assets must be reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax asset will not be realized 
in assessing whether a valuation allowance is required  the company considers the ability to realize the asset through carryback to taxable income in prior years  the future reversal of existing taxable temporary differences  and future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
based on this assessment  a valuation allowance of  is required on the net operating loss carryforward as disclosed in note to item of this form k 
financial condition liquidity effective management of balance sheet liquidity is necessary to fund growth in earning assets and to pay liability maturities  depositors withdrawal requirements  shareholders dividends and to purchase treasury stock under stock repurchase programs 
the company has numerous sources of liquidity including a portfolio of shorter term loans  readily marketable investment securities  the ability to attract consumer time deposits  access to various borrowing arrangements and capital resources 
available borrowing arrangements are summarized as follows the bank federal funds lines aggregating million with seven correspondent banks  subject to continued good financial standing 
as of december   all million was available for use under these lines 
reverse repurchase agreement lines aggregating million with five brokerage firms are available based on the pledge of specific collateral and continued good financial standing of the bank

the bank has a borrowing line of approximately million at the discount window of the federal reserve bank  subject to the availability of collateral 
the line was unused at december  
table of contents parent company the company has a revolving credit arrangement for million 
the line was unused at december  the maturity date of the line is april  and is anticipated to continue to be renewed annually 
the company also has cash  short term investments and other marketable securities totaling million at december  interest rate sensitivity interest rate risk arises when the maturity or repricing of assets differs significantly from the maturity or repricing of liabilities 
the company s financial results could be affected by changes in market interest rates such as the prime rate  libor and treasury yields and rate competition for deposits 
the objective of interest rate risk management is to provide the maximum levels of net interest income while maintaining acceptable levels of interest rate risk and liquidity risk 
a number of measures are used to monitor and manage interest rate risk  including income simulation  rate shock analysis and interest sensitivity gap analysis 
an income simulation model is the primary tool used to assess the direction and magnitude of changes in net interest income resulting from changes in market interest rates 
the model incorporates management assumptions regarding the level of interest rate changes on indeterminate maturity deposit products savings  money market  now and demand deposits for a given level of market rate changes  as well as the effect of changing interest rates on certain callable assets and liabilities 
other assumptions in the model include prepayment speeds on mortgage related assets and cash flows and maturities of other financial instruments 
these assumptions are inherently uncertain and  as a result  the model cannot precisely estimate net interest income or precisely predict the impact of higher or lower interest rates on net interest income 
actual results will differ from simulated results due to timing  magnitude and frequency of interest rate changes and changes in market conditions and management strategies  among other factors 
the company uses rate shock analysis to evaluate the effects of various parallel shifts in market interest rates  upward or downward  on net interest income relative to a base rate scenario where market interest rates remain flat at december year end levels 
the interest rate sensitivity presented includes assumptions that i the composition of the company s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at year end will remain constant over the measurement period and ii that changes in market interest rates are parallel and instantaneous across the yield curve 
this analysis is limited by the fact that it does not include any balance sheet repositioning actions the company may take such as lengthening or shortening the duration of the securities portfolio should severe movements in interest rates occur 
these actions would likely reduce the variability of net interest income in extreme interest rate shock forecasts 
in the past the rate shock analyses have shown that the company is liability sensitive  that is  interest sensitive liabilities exceed interest sensitive assets  and this generally results in the net interest margin increasing in a falling rate environment and decreasing in a rising rate environment 
however  an immediate increase or decrease in market interest rates may not result in an immediate identical increase or decrease in rates paid on deposit liabilities 
additionally  in the current very low interest rate environment  if market rates decrease  the rates paid on deposit liabilities could not reflect the full amount of the decrease since rates are already so low 
if rates increase  rates paid on deposits may not reflect the full extent of the rate increase until rates approach a more historical level 

table of contents the company s policy objective is to limit the change in annual net interest income to from an immediate and sustained parallel change in interest rates rate shock of basis points 
at december  and  the company was within its policy objectives 
as a result of absolute interest rates being so low at year end and  rates on fed funds  the three month treasury  libor and rates paid on certain core deposits are all below  the company assumed rates will probably not decline basis points 
the scale shown below reflects a more meaningful plus or minus and basis point rate shock 
as of december  and the company had the following estimated net interest income sensitivity profile 
bp bp bp bp dollars in thousands annual net interest income change from an immediate change in rates percent change bp bp bp bp dollars in thousands annual net interest income change from an immediate change in rates percent change the profile for indicates the company s net interest margin increasing in a falling rate environment and decreasing in a rising rate environment 
the following gap analysis is prepared based on the maturity and repricing characteristics of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities for selected time periods 
the mismatch between asset and liability repricings or maturities within a time period is commonly referred to as the gap for that period 
the gap report does not fully capture the true dynamics of interest rate changes including the timing and or degree of interest rate changes 
while most of the asset categories rates change when certain independent indices such as the prime rate change  most liability categories are repriced at the company s discretion subject  however  to competitive interest rate pressures 

table of contents the table below presents a static gap analysis as of december  which shows the company s rate sensitive liabilities may reprice more quickly than its rate sensitive assets 
in addition  the gap report does not reflect the call associated with certain investment assets  which if called  significantly reduces the negative cumulative gap for the time periods of one year or less

table of contents contractual obligations and commercial commitments contractual obligations the company has certain obligations and commitments to make future payments under contracts

the following tables represent the company s contractual obligations less than one year one to three years three to five years over years dollars in thousands long term debt operating lease obligations the company does not have any capital leases or long term purchase obligations 
commercial commitments in the normal course of business  there are various outstanding commitments and contingent liabilities  including commitments to extend credit  performance standby letters of credit and financial standby letters of credit collectively commitments that are not reflected in the consolidated financial statements 
the company s exposure to credit loss in the event of nonperformance by the other party to the commitments is limited to their contractual amount 
many commitments expire without being used 
therefore  the amounts stated below do not necessarily represent future cash commitments 
commitments to extend credit are agreements to lend funds to a customer as long as there is no violation of any condition established in the contract 
specifically  the home equity lines are reviewed annually and the bank has the ability to deny any future extensions of credit based upon the borrowers continued credit worthiness 
performance standby letters of credit are conditional commitments issued by the company to guarantee the performance of a customer to a third party 
financial standby letters of credit are conditional guarantees of payment to a third party on behalf of a customer of the company 
these commitments are subject to the same credit policies followed for loans recorded in the financial statements

allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses is maintained at a level believed adequate by management to absorb estimated probable loan losses 
management s periodic evaluation of the adequacy of the allowance is based on the company s past loan loss experience  known and inherent risks in the portfolio  composition of the loan portfolio  current economic conditions  historical losses experienced by the industry  value of the underlying collateral and other relevant factors 
loans which are determined to be uncollectible are charged off against the allowance for loan losses and recoveries of loans that were previously charged off are credited to the allowance

table of contents the company records specific valuation allowances on commercial  commercial real estate mortgage and construction loans when a loan is considered to be impaired 
a loan is impaired when  based on an evaluation of current information and events  it is probable that the company will not be able to collect all amounts due principal and interest pursuant to the original contractual terms 
the company measures impairment based upon the present value of expected future cash flows discounted at the loan s original effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
large groups of homogeneous loans  such as residential mortgage  home equity  indirect vehicle and consumer loans  are collectively evaluated for impairment and not subject to impaired loan disclosures 
interest income on impaired loans is recognized using the cash basis method

table of contents net charge offs for totaled  or of average loans  and net charge offs for were  or 
of average loans 
virtually all net charge offs for relate to  charged off on two commercial construction loans 
see asset quality for discussion regarding these construction loans 
the remaining charge offs relate primarily to the company s indirect vehicle portfolio 
although net charge offs as a percent of the average indirect vehicle portfolio increased to 
in from 
in largely due to the soft used car market  these ratios are significantly below industry averages 
the company s allowance for loan losses as a percent of loans outstanding was 
at december  as compared to 
in and 
in the allowance for loan losses is sufficient to provide for probable loan losses based upon management s evaluation of the risks inherent in the various loan categories 
management believes the allowance for loan losses is at an adequate level 
management of the bank prepares a detailed analysis  at least quarterly  reviewing the adequacy of its allowance and  when appropriate  recommends an increase or decrease in its provision for loan losses 
the quarterly analysis is broken down into two segments the allocated portion for specific loans and loan categories and the unallocated portion which is not specifically related to a specific segment of the portfolio 
the analysis to determine the allocated portion of the allowance is again divided into two parts 
the first part involves primarily an estimated calculation of losses on potential problem loans on the management watch list and nonperforming loans 
loans on the management watch list are classified as special mention  substandard  doubtful  or loss 
an asset is classified as substandard if it is inadequately protected by the current net worth and paying capacity of the obligor or of the collateral pledged  if any 
substandard assets include those characterized by the distinct possibility that the company will sustain some loss if the deficiencies are not corrected 
assets classified as doubtful have all the weaknesses inherent in those classified substandard with the added characteristic that the weaknesses present make collection or liquidation in full  on the basis of currently existing facts  conditions and values  highly questionable and improbable 
assets classified as loss are those considered uncollectible and worthy of charge off 
assets that do not currently expose the company to sufficient risk to warrant classification in one of the aforementioned categories  but possess weaknesses that may or may not be within the control of the customer are deemed to be special mention 
the second part involves primarily a calculation of the bank s actual net charge off history excluding fraud loss averaged with industry net charge off history by major loan categories 
in determining the unallocated portion of the reserve  the bank considers its portfolio composition  loan growth  management capabilities  economic trends  credit concentrations  industry risks  underlying collateral values and the opinions of bank management and involves a higher degree of subjectivity in its determination 
accordingly  because each of these criteria is subject to change  the allocation of the allowance is made for analytical purposes and is not necessarily indicative of the trend of future loan losses in any particular loan category 
the total allowance is available to absorb losses from any segment of the portfolio 
see asset quality for nonperforming assets and potential problem loans 
in order to identify potential risks in the loan portfolio and determine the necessary provision for loan losses  detailed information is obtained from the following sources monthly reports prepared by the bank s management and reviewed by the loan committee which contain information on the overall characteristics of the loan portfolio  including delinquencies and nonaccruals  and specific analysis of loans requiring special attention ie watch lists  examinations of the loan portfolio of the bank by federal and state regulatory agencies  including shared national credit reviews of syndicated loans  reviews by third party credit review consultants  and market valuations on nationally syndicated loans traded in the secondary market 

table of contents the following table considers both parts of the analysis discussed above to determine the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type for each of the last five years 
allocation of allowance for loan losses december  dollars in thousands allocation of allowance for loan losses real estate construction  land acquisition and development loans commercial mortgage loans residential mortgage loans home equity loans commercial loans indirect vehicle loans consumer loans credit card loans unallocated total allowance percentage of loans to gross loans real estate construction  land acquisition and development loans commercial mortgage loans residential mortgage loans home equity loans commercial loans indirect vehicle loans consumer loans the allocation for commercial and commercial real estate loans increased from due to an increase in the level of classification of management s watch list loans as a result of the economic downturn 
the allocation for construction  land acquisition and development loans decreased in spite of a significant charge off in this portfolio see asset quality 
this decrease is due to a reduction in the portfolio balance and the review of of the commercial construction portfolio performed by a third party in june  which review did not identify any additional losses 
in calculating the allocation of allowance for construction loans  the charge off of the apparently fraudulent loan was not considered in the bank s historical charge off data due to the isolated nature of the apparent fraud 
asset quality the accrual of interest is discontinued on commercial  real estate and consumer loans when the continuity of contractual principal or interest is deemed doubtful by management or when days or more past due and the loan is not well secured or in the process of collection 
interest income is recorded on these loans only as it is collected 
interest payments on nonaccrual loans may be applied directly to loan principal for accounting purposes

the project filed a chapter bankruptcy in september as of december   the loan had been charged down by  leaving a remaining balance of  the property which secured this loan was sold by order of the bankruptcy court in september for million  and the proceeds were deposited with the court 
claims to these proceeds were filed by the two lenders  the mechanics lien claimants  and lawyers 
in march  an order was entered by the court approving a signed agreement among all parties and proceeds of approximately million were distributed to the bank 
in may  the bank discovered an apparent fraud related to a construction loan to build a luxury high rise condominium in chicago 
the bank filed suit against the developers and certain of its principals and affiliates which included a foreclosure against the property  a collection action on guarantees  and a claim for a scheme to defraud the bank 
three individuals have also been criminally indicted for conduct relating to the loan 
the bank also filed a claim with the bonding company  which has been denied 
the bank plans to pursue litigation against the bonding company along with certain other potentially responsible parties 
no assurances can be given about the likelihood  amount or timing of any recoveries 
in november  by agreement in lieu of foreclosure  the bank obtained the title to the property and transferred the title to a newly formed bank subsidiary  west erie  llc 
west erie  llc has negotiated a new guaranteed maximum price contract with the general contractor and has engaged a prominent local developer as a consultant to help complete and market the unit luxury condominium project 
as of november   when title was taken  the property had been written down by  and transferred to other real estate owned oreo at its estimated net realizable value of million 
additional funding to complete the project is expected to approximate million  of which million was advanced prior to december  the balance in oreo from the project was  therefore  million at december  new advances will continue to be capitalized to the balance in oreo 
the company will periodically evaluate the property for potential impairment 
if a decline in value exists  an allowance will be established and valuation adjustments will be charged to earnings 
the bank expects construction will be substantially completed  except for finish selections on the top two floors  by late summer the repayment of the bank s investment in the project is dependent on the strength of the chicago luxury condominium market 
currently this market has been slowing 
marketing of the units began in january none of the units have been sold as of march  losses on repossessed vehicles are charged off to the allowance when title is taken and the vehicle is valued 
once the bank obtains title  repossessed vehicles are not included in loans  but rather are classified as other

the bank s portfolio of repossessed assets increased to  at december  from  at december  in addition to nonperforming assets  there are certain loans in the portfolio which management has identified  through its problem loan identification process  which exhibit a higher than normal credit risk 
however  these loans are still considered performing and  accordingly  are not included in nonperforming loans
