revenue recognition the company recognizes sales of plants and lawn and garden products upon shipment from its facilities to customers 
revenues from sales of landscaping services are recognized as plants are installed at the customers facilities 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowance for doubtful accounts is an amount that management believes will be adequate to absorb estimated losses on existing accounts receivable that are estimated to be uncollectible based on evaluations of collectibility of specific customers and their prior credit experience 
because of uncertainties inherent in the estimation process  management s estimate of credit losses inherent in the existing accounts receivable and related allowance may change in the near term 
capitalization of inventory costs direct and indirect costs that are capitalized as part of inventory of plant material which management estimates cannot be recovered from future sales of plant inventory are charged to cost of sales 
management s determination of the amount of capitalized costs that should be charged to cost of sales is based on historical sales experience and its judgement with respect to the future marketability of the inventory
