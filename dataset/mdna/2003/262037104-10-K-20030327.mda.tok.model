item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following is management s discussion and analysis of certain significant factors that have affected certain aspects of the company s financial position and results of operations during the periods included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto presented elsewhere in this report 
overview dril quip manufactures highly engineered offshore drilling and production equipment which is well suited for use in deepwater  harsh environment and severe service applications 
the company designs and manufactures subsea equipment  surface equipment and offshore rig equipment for use by major integrated  large independent and foreign national oil and gas companies in offshore areas throughout the world 
the company s principal products consist of subsea and surface wellheads  subsea and surface production trees  mudline hanger systems  specialty connectors and associated pipe  drilling and production riser systems  wellhead connectors and diverters 
dril quip also provides installation and reconditioning services and rents running tools for use in connection with the installation and retrieval of its products 
both the market for offshore drilling and production equipment and services and the company s business are substantially dependent on the condition of the oil and gas industry and  in particular  the willingness of oil and gas companies to make capital expenditures on exploration  drilling and production operations offshore 
oil and gas prices and the level of offshore drilling and production activity have historically been characterized by significant volatility 
during  the continuing worldwide economic recession  combined with uncertainties related to the situation in the middle east  contributed to ongoing weakness in the oil service sector 
the company expects this weakness to continue at least through the first half of in any event  any future decline in hydrocarbon prices significantly below historical levels would likely have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations 
there can be no assurance that the current oil price levels will lead to increased oil and gas exploration and production activity or that demand for the company s products and services will reflect such improvement  if any 
the company operates its business and markets its products and services in all of the significant oil and gas producing areas in the world and is  therefore  subject to the risks customarily attendant to international operations and investments in foreign countries 
these risks include nationalization  expropriation  war  acts of terrorism and civil disturbance  restrictive action by local governments  limitation on repatriation of earnings  change in foreign tax laws and change in currency exchange rates  any of which could have an adverse effect on either the company s ability to manufacture its products in its facilities abroad or the demand in certain regions for the company s products or both 
to date  the company has not experienced any significant problems in foreign countries arising from local government actions or political instability  but there is no assurance that such problems will not arise in the future 
interruption of the company s international operations could have a material adverse effect on its overall operations 
dril quip s revenues are generated by its two operating groups the product group and the service group 
the product group manufactures offshore drilling and production equipment  and the service group provides installation and reconditioning services as well as rental running tools for installation and retrieval of its products 
in  the company derived of its revenues from the sale of its products and of its revenues from services 
revenues from the service group generally correlate to revenues from product sales  because increased product sales generate increased revenues from installation services and rental running tools 
the company has substantial international operations  with approximately  and of its revenues derived from foreign sales in  and  respectively 
during the same years  approximately of all products sold were manufactured in the united states 
the company accounts for larger and more complex projects that have relatively longer manufacturing time frames on a percentage of completion basis 
during  projects representing approximately of the company s revenues were accounted for using percentage of completion accounting 
this percentage may fluctuate in the future 
revenues accounted for in this manner are generally recognized on the ratio of costs incurred to the total estimated costs 
accordingly  price and cost estimates are reviewed periodically as the work progresses  and adjustments proportionate to the percentage of completion are reflected in the period when such estimates are revised 
amounts received from customers in excess of revenues recognized are classified as a current liability 
the principal elements of cost of sales are labor  raw materials and manufacturing overhead 
variable costs  such as labor  raw materials  supplies and energy  generally account for approximately two thirds of the company s cost of sales 
the company has experienced increased labor costs over the past few years due to the limited supply of skilled workers 
fixed costs  such as the fixed portion of manufacturing overhead  constitute the remainder of the company s cost of sales 
the company continually seeks to improve its efficiency and cost position 
cost of sales as a percentage of revenues is also influenced by the product mix sold in any particular quarter and market conditions 
the company s costs related to its foreign operations do not significantly differ from its domestic costs

net income 
net income increased by approximately  from million in to million in for the reasons set forth above 
liquidity and capital resources the primary liquidity needs of the company are i to fund capital expenditures to increase manufacturing capacity  improve and expand facilities and manufacture additional rental running tools and ii to fund working capital 
the company s principal sources of funds are cash flows from operations and bank indebtedness 
net cash provided by operating activities was million in net cash used in operating activities was  in and million in cash provided by net income  depreciation  and reductions in trade receivables were offset by decreases in accounts payables and accrued expenses 
capital expenditures by the company were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
principal payments on long term debt were  and  and million in  and  respectively 
the following table presents long term contractual obligations of the company and the related payments due in total and by year as of december  in thousands payments due by year after contractual obligations total in thousands long term debt maturities 
       capital lease obligations 
operating lease obligations   purchase obligations    total        the company has a credit facility with guaranty bank  fsb providing an unsecured revolving line of credit of up to million 
at the option of the company  borrowing under this facility bears interest at either a rate equal to libor london interbank offered rate plus or the guaranty bank base rate 
the facility calls for quarterly interest payments and terminates on may  as of december   the company had drawn down million under this facility for operating activities and capital expenditures 
dril quip europe limited has a credit agreement with the bank of scotland dated march  in the amount of uk pounds sterling million approximately us million 
borrowing under this facility bears interest at the bank of scotland base rate  which was at december   plus  and is repayable in equal monthly installments  plus interest 
substantially all of this facility was used to finance capital expenditures in norway 
dril quip asia pacific pte ltd 
has a secured term loan with the overseas union bank dated august  in the amount of singapore dollars million approximately us million 
borrowing under this facility bears interest at the swap rate  approximately  plus and is repayable in equal quarterly installments  plus interest 
this facility was used to finance capital expenditures in singapore 
the company believes that cash generated from operations plus cash on hand and its existing line of credit will be sufficient to fund operations  working capital needs and anticipated capital expenditure requirements in however  any significant future declines in hydrocarbon prices below historical levels could have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity 
should market conditions result in unexpected cash requirements  the company believes that additional borrowing from commercial lending institutions would be readily available and more than adequate to meet such requirements 
backlog backlog consists of firm customer orders for which a purchase order has been received  satisfactory credit or financing arrangements exist and delivery is scheduled 
the company s backlog was approximately million at december   a decrease of million or over the backlog of million at december  the company expects to fill approximately of the december  backlog by december  the remaining backlog at december  consists of longer term projects which are being designed and manufactured to customer specifications rather than sold out of inventory 
the company can give no assurance that backlog will remain at current levels 
sales of the company s products are affected by prices for oil and natural gas  which fluctuated significantly during and significant future declines in oil and natural gas prices could reduce new customer orders  which would cause the company s backlog to decline 
all of the company s projects currently included in its backlog are subject to change and or termination at the option of the customer 
in the case of a change or termination  the customer is required to pay the company for work performed and other costs necessarily incurred as a result of the change or termination 
geographic areas the company s operations are divided into three geographic areas based upon the locations of its manufacturing facilities the united states houston  texas  europe  middle east and africa aberdeen  scotland and asia pacific singapore 
the united states area includes sales to both north and south america 
the area of europe  middle east and africa includes primarily sales to the north sea  the middle east and africa 
the asia pacific area includes sales primarily to australia  thailand  malaysia and indonesia 
revenues for each of these areas are dependent upon the ultimate sale of products and services to the company s customers 
for information on revenues by geographic area  see note to the consolidated financial statements on page revenues of the united states area are also influenced by its sale of products to the european and asia pacific subsidiaries 
accordingly  the operating incomes of each area are closely tied to third party sales  and the operating income of the united states area is also dependent upon its level of intercompany sales 
currency risk through its subsidiaries  the company conducts a portion of business in currencies other than the united states dollar  principally the british pound sterling and the norwegian kroner 
the company generally attempts to minimize its currency exchange risk by seeking international contracts payable in local currency in amounts equal to the company s estimated operating costs payable in local currency and in us dollars for the balance of the contract 
because of this strategy  the company has not experienced significant transaction gains or losses associated with changes in currency exchange rates and does not anticipate such exposure to be material in the future 
in  and  the company had a loss of approximately  a gain of  and a loss of  respectively 
the losses in and and the gain in were the result of currency fluctuations related to payables and trade receivables 
there is no assurance that the company will be able to protect itself against such fluctuations in the future 
historically  the company has not conducted business in countries that limit repatriation of earnings 
however  as the company expands its international operations  it may begin operating in countries that have such limitations 
further  there can be no assurance that the countries in which the company currently operates will not adopt policies limiting repatriation of earnings in the future 
the company also has significant investments in countries other than the united states  principally its manufacturing operations in aberdeen  scotland and  to a lesser extent  singapore and norway 
the functional currency of these foreign operations is the local currency and  accordingly  financial statement assets and liabilities are translated at current exchange rates 
resulting translation adjustments are reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity and have no current effect on earnings or cash flow 
critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with united states generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition 
for the majority of the company s sales  revenue is recorded at the time the manufacturing process is complete and the products have been shipped to the consumer 
certain revenues are derived from long term contracts  which generally require more than one year to fulfill 
revenues and cost of sales and related profits from long term contracts are recognized under the percentage of completion method based on a cost incurred basis 
losses on long term contracts are recognized when they become known 
contracts for long term projects usually contain provisions for customer progress payments 
payments and billings in excess of revenues recognized are deferred and are included as a customer prepayment liability 
allowances on accounts receivable are provided primarily on the specific identification method 
inventories 
inventory costs are determined principally by the use of the first in  first out fifo method  and are stated at the lower of cost or market 
inventory is valued principally using standard costs that are calculated based upon direct costs incurred and overhead allocations 
periodically  obsolescence reviews are performed on slow moving inventories and reserves are established based on current assessments about future demands and market conditions 
if market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory reserves may be required 
contingent liabilities 
we establish reserves for estimated loss contingencies when we believe a loss is probable and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
revisions to contingent liabilities are reflected in income in the period in which different facts or information become known or circumstances change that affect our previous assumptions with respect to the likelihood or amount of loss 
reserves for contingent liabilities are based upon our assumptions and estimates regarding the probable outcome of the matter 
should the outcome differ from our assumptions and estimates  revisions to the estimated reserves for contingent liabilities would be required 
the company has no significant derivative instruments and no off balance sheet hedging or financing arrangements or contracts or operations that rely upon credit or similar ratings
