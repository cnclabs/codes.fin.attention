results of operations sonic derives its revenues primarily from company owned restaurant sales and royalty payments from franchisees 
we also receive revenues from initial franchise fees  area development fees  and the selling and leasing of signs and  in limited circumstances  real estate 
in addition  sonic owns and receives income from a minority interest in a few franchised restaurants 
costs of company owned restaurant sales and minority interest in earnings of restaurants relate directly to company owned restaurant sales 
other expenses  such as depreciation  amortization  and general and administrative expenses  relate to both company owned restaurant operations  as well as our franchising operations 
our revenues and expenses are directly affected by the number and sales volumes of company owned restaurants 
our revenues and  to a lesser extent  expenses are also affected by the number and sales volumes of franchised restaurants 
initial franchise fees and franchise royalties are directly affected by the number of franchised restaurant openings 
the following table sets forth the percentage relationship to total revenues  unless otherwise indicated  of certain items included in sonic s statements of income 
the table also sets forth certain restaurant data for the periods indicated

number of restaurants open at end of year 
system wide restaurant count and sales include both company owned and franchise information 
management believes that system wide information is useful in analyzing the growth of the brand as well as the company s revenues since franchisees pay royalties based on a percentage of sales 
represents percentage increase from the comparable period in the prior year 
represents percentage change for stores open since the beginning of fiscal year for company owned restaurants and stores open for a minimum of one year for franchise restaurants and system wide restaurants 
comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year total revenues increased to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year company owned restaurant sales increased to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year of the million net increase  million was due to the net addition of company owned restaurants since the beginning of fiscal year  million from the addition of newly constructed restaurants and acquired restaurants since the beginning of fiscal year less million from stores sold or closed during the same period 
the increase in company owned restaurant sales from the net addition of restaurants was partially offset by slight sales decreases in the amount of million by stores open the full reporting periods of fiscal years and franchise royalties increased to million during fiscal year  compared to million during fiscal year of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to an increase in the number of franchise restaurants operating in fiscal year compared to fiscal year the balance of the increase resulted from an increase in the effective royalty rate from in fiscal year to in fiscal year as substantially all of the new stores opened under the newest license agreement  which has a higher average royalty rate 
in addition  each of our license agreements contains an ascending royalty rate feature that allows the royalty rate to increase as sales volumes increase 
franchise fees increased to million as franchise drive ins opened during fiscal year as compared to during fiscal year we expect total revenues to grow during fiscal year by approximately to based on targeted same store sales growth of to as well as the addition of approximately to new drive ins to company owned and to franchised locations 
we anticipate that the continued benefit of the ascending royalty rate and new franchise store openings will result in to million in incremental franchise income royalties and fees in fiscal year in addition  substantially all new drive ins will open under our newest form of license agreement which contains a higher average royalty rate and initial opening fee 
restaurant cost of operations  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  was during fiscal year compared to during fiscal year food and packaging costs  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales remained flat at of company owned restaurant sales as a result of a generally favorable commodity environment including lower unit level costs for several items including beef and dairy costs 
the decrease in unit level costs was offset by a slight increase in discounting from standard menu prices during the year 
payroll and employee benefits  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  increased basis points to of sales as a result of an increased investment in store level labor and higher worker s compensation and health insurance costs 
we continued to invest in management infrastructure at the store level as we rolled out breakfast to the remaining of our stores in fiscal year we believe that this investment will not only help breakfast be successful but will also lay an important foundation for growing our average unit volumes over time 
other operating expenses  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  increased basis points primarily as a result of the lack of growth in average store volumes  an increase in the rate of advertising contributions in preparation for the breakfast rollout and rent expense related to the acquisition of franchise drive ins where the franchisee retained the real estate 
minority interest in earnings of restaurants decreased  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  to during fiscal year  compared to during fiscal year as a result of the decline in our restaurant level margins 
most of the managers and supervisors of company owned restaurants own a minority interest in the restaurants  and a substantial portion of their compensation flows through the minority interest in earnings of restaurants 
looking forward  we expect restaurant cost of operations  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  to increase in the range of basis points as a result of the increased investment in store level operations for the first half of fiscal year and upward pressure on food costs notably dairy and beef costs 
we continue to look for ways to strengthen our partnership program which may include greater ownership for store level partners 
however  since we expect store level margins to decrease in fiscal year  minority interest in earnings of restaurants is expected to remain flat or decline as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  as a percentage of total revenues  to during fiscal year  compared with during fiscal year as a result of the leverage of operating at higher sales volumes 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to grow in the range of to in fiscal year while continuing to decline as a percentage of total revenues 
we anticipate that a significant portion of our future revenue growth will be attributable to company owned restaurants 
company owned restaurants require a lower level of selling  general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of revenues  than our franchising operations since most expenses of company owned restaurant operations are reflected in restaurant cost of operations and minority interest in restaurant operations 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million during fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year  while remaining flat as a percentage of total revenue 
the increase in depreciation resulted primarily from new drive in development and store acquisitions in the third fiscal quarter of looking forward  we expect depreciation to grow by approximately for fiscal year  including a higher rate of growth in the first half of the year as a result of restaurants acquired in the san antonio market 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the san antonio acquisition 
during fiscal year  two drive ins in developing markets became impaired under the guidelines of fas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and estimates were revised on two stores which were previously impaired under fas as a result  a provision for impairment of long lived assets of million was recorded for the drive ins carrying cost in excess of its estimated fair value 
we adopted fas accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which superceded fas  effective at the beginning of fiscal year during fiscal year  two drive ins became impaired under the guidelines of fas  which resulted in a provision for impairment of million to reduce the drive ins carrying cost to estimated fair value 
we continue to perform quarterly analyses of certain underperforming restaurants 
it is reasonably possible that the estimate of future cash flows associated with these restaurants may change in the near future resulting in the need to write down assets associated with one or more of these restaurants to fair value 
income from operations increased to million during fiscal year from million during fiscal year  due primarily to the growth in revenues and other matters discussed above 
net interest expense in fiscal year declined to million from million in fiscal year the year over year decline in short term interest rates combined with the refinancing of million in senior notes more than offset the effect of the increase in amounts outstanding under the line of credit resulting from additional borrowings to fund share repurchases of million and capital expenditures of million  including million for acquisitions 
going forward  we expect interest expense to continue to decline  particularly in the latter part of fiscal year  depending on the level of share repurchases and acquisition activity provision for income taxes reflects an effective federal and state tax rate of for fiscal year and net income increased to million during fiscal year from million in fiscal year diluted earnings per share increased to per share during fiscal year  compared to per share during fiscal year  for an increase of 
comparison of fiscal year to fiscal year total revenues increased to million during fiscal year from million in fiscal year company owned restaurant sales increased to million during fiscal year from million in fiscal year of the million increase  million was due to the net addition of company owned restaurants since the beginning of fiscal year million from the addition of newly constructed restaurants and acquired restaurants since the beginning of fiscal year  less million from nine stores sold or closed during the same period 
average sales increases of approximately by stores open the full reporting periods of fiscal year and accounted for million of the increase 
franchise royalties increased to million during fiscal year  compared to million in fiscal year of the million increase  approximately million was attributable to franchise same store sales growth of combined with an increase in the effective royalty rate from in fiscal year to in fiscal year each of our license agreements contains an ascending royalty rate feature whereby the royalty rate increases as sales volumes increase 
the balance of the increase resulted from an increase in the number of franchise restaurants operating in fiscal year compared to fiscal year franchise fees decreased as franchise drive ins opened during fiscal year as compared to in fiscal year however  the average franchise fee increased as a greater percentage of stores opened under the newest form of license agreement  which has a higher franchise fee and royalty rate 
restaurant cost of operations  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  was during fiscal year compared to in fiscal year food and packaging costs  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  remained flat as lower than expected beef costs and a moderation in dairy costs were offset by slightly increased discounting from standard menu prices 
payroll and employee benefits  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  increased basis points as a result of an increase in average wage rates  increased investment in store level labor as a part of the our commitment to outstanding customer service  and an increase in training and store level management for the rollout of the breakfast program to a significant number of restaurants 
other operating expenses  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  decreased basis points primarily as a result of the leverage of higher sales volumes and improvements in utility costs 
minority interest in earnings of restaurants decreased  as a percentage of company owned restaurant sales  to during fiscal year  compared to in fiscal year as a result of the decline in overall restaurant level margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased  as a percentage of total revenues  to during fiscal year  compared with in fiscal year as a result of the leverage of operating at higher sales volumes 
depreciation and amortization expense increased to million during fiscal year compared to in fiscal year while declining as a percentage of revenue to as compared to the prior year 
the increase in depreciation resulted primarily from new drive in development and store acquisitions in the third fiscal quarter of the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective september  which resulted in a reduction in amortization expense of million during fiscal year as compared to fiscal year  excluding any related tax effects 
during fiscal year  two drive ins in developing markets became impaired under the guidelines of fas accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  and estimates were revised on three stores which were previously impaired under fas as a result  a provision for impairment of long lived assets of million was recorded for the drive ins carrying cost in excess of their estimated fair value 
during fiscal year  two drive ins became impaired under fas resulting in an impairment of million 
income from operations increased to million during fiscal year from million in fiscal year due primarily to the growth in revenues and other matters discussed above 
net interest expense during fiscal year increased to million from million in fiscal year this increase was the result of additional borrowings to fund share repurchases of million and capital expenditures of million  including million for acquisitions 
provision for income taxes reflects an effective federal and state tax rate of for fiscal year and net income increased to million in fiscal year compared to million in fiscal year diluted earnings per share increased to per share during fiscal year  compared to per share in fiscal year  for an increase of 
liquidity and sources of capital net cash provided by operating activities increased million or in fiscal year as compared to the same period in fiscal year  primarily as the result of the increase in operating profit before depreciation and amortization  partially offset by the gain on disposition of assets and the provision for deferred income taxes 
we opened newly constructed restaurants and acquired a net of existing restaurants from franchisees in fiscal year we funded total capital additions for fiscal year of million  which included the cost of newly opened restaurants  new equipment for existing restaurants  retrofits of existing restaurants  restaurants under construction  acquired restaurants  and other capital expenditures  from cash generated by operating activities and through borrowings under our line of credit 
during fiscal year  we purchased the real estate for of the newly constructed and acquired restaurants 
we expect to own the land and building for most of our future newly constructed restaurants 
we repurchased approximately million shares of common stock under our stock repurchase program during fiscal year at an aggregate cost of million 
our board of directors expanded the stock repurchase program in august  increasing the funds authorized for the repurchase of the company s common stock to million and extended the term of the program to december  as of august   our total cash balance of million reflected the impact of the cash generated from operating activities  borrowing activity  and capital expenditures mentioned above 
we had an agreement with a group of banks which provided the company with an million line of credit expiring in july of on april   we amended the bank line of credit agreement to increase the maximum borrowing commitment from to million and extend the maturity of the agreement by two years to july the company refinanced million of long term debt  which matured on april   under its senior unsecured notes with amounts available under its line of credit 
we plan to use the line of credit to finance the opening of newly constructed restaurants  acquisitions of existing restaurants  purchases of the company s common stock and for other general corporate purposes 
as of august   our outstanding borrowings under the line of credit were million  at an effective borrowing rate of  as well as million in outstanding letters of credit 
the amount available under the line of credit as of august   was million 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the company s long term debt 
we plan capital expenditures of million in fiscal year  excluding potential acquisitions and share repurchases 
these capital expenditures primarily relate to the development of additional company owned restaurants  stall additions  relocations of older restaurants  store equipment upgrades  and enhancements to existing financial and operating information systems 
we expect to fund these capital expenditures through borrowings under our existing line of credit and cash flow from operations 
we expect to generate free cash flow which we define as net income plus depreciation and amortization less capital expenditures  other than franchise acquisitions and share repurchases of million to million during fiscal the company has long term debt maturing in fiscal years  and of million  million and million  respectively 
we expect to refinance amounts maturing in under the senior secured notes with our line of credit and plan to extend the line of credit maturing in under existing renewal options and to increase the amount available as needed 
we believe that existing cash and funds generated from operations  as well as borrowings under the line of credit  will meet the company s needs for the foreseeable future 
we entered into an agreement with certain franchisees during fiscal year  which provides them with the option to sell restaurants to us anytime during the period commencing january  and ending june  we estimate that the cost of the acquisition  if it were to occur  would be in the range of to million and anticipate that the acquisition would be funded through operating cash flows and borrowings under the company s existing line of credit 
contractual obligations and commitments in the normal course of business  sonic enters into purchase contracts  lease agreements and borrowing arrangements 
our commitments and obligations as of august   are summarized in the following table payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt     capital leases      operating leases      vendor purchase agreements   total      impact of inflation though increases in labor  food or other operating costs could adversely affect our operations  we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on income during the past several years 
seasonality we do not expect seasonality to affect operations in a materially adverse manner 
our results during our second fiscal quarter the months of december  january and february generally are lower than other quarters because of the climate of the locations of a number of company owned and franchised restaurants 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to use its judgment to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
these assumptions and estimates could have a material effect on the company s financial statements 
we evaluate our assumptions and estimates on an ongoing basis based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be relevant under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we annually review our financial reporting and disclosure practices and accounting policies to ensure that our financial reporting and disclosures provide accurate and transparent information relative to the current economic and business environment 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of risk  judgment and or complexity 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review each restaurant for impairment when events or circumstances indicate it might be impaired 
we test for impairment using historical cash flows and other relevant facts and circumstances as the primary basis for our estimates of future cash flows 
this process requires the use of estimates and assumptions  which are subject to a high degree of judgment 
in addition  at least annually we assess the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets related to our brand and restaurants 
these impairment tests require us to estimate fair values of our brand and our restaurants by making assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors 
if these assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
ownership program allowance for uncollectible notes and accounts receivable 
our restaurant philosophy stresses an ownership relationship with supervisors and drive in managers 
most supervisors and managers of company owned restaurants own an equity interest in the restaurant  which is financed by the company 
these notes are typically financed for a term of five years  bear interest at market rates  and are secured by the partner s equity interest 
we evaluate whether the partner notes are collectible and make estimates of bad debts based on the restaurant s financial performance and collection history with individual partners 
if an individual restaurant s performance declines  the probability of default by the partners is increased 
supervisors and managers are not employees of sonic or of the restaurant in which they have an ownership interest 
the investments made by managers and supervisors in each partnership or limited liability company are accounted for as minority interests in the financial statements 
the ownership agreements contain provisions  which give sonic the right  but not the obligation  to purchase the minority interest of the supervisor or manager in a restaurant 
the amount of the investment made by a partner and the amount of the buy out are based on a number of factors  primarily upon the restaurant s financial performance for the preceding months  and are intended to approximate the fair value of a minority interest in the restaurant 
such payments are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
we collect royalties from franchisees and provide for estimated losses for receivables that are not likely to be collected 
general allowances for uncollectible receivables are estimated based on historical trends 
although we have a good relationship with our franchisees and collection rates are currently high  if average sales or the financial health of franchisees were to deteriorate  we may have to increase reserves against collection of franchise revenues 
contingency reserves 
from time to time  we are involved in various legal proceedings and have certain unresolved claims pending involving taxing authorities  franchisees  suppliers  employees and competitors 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as estimate potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each issue 
in addition  our estimate of probable losses may change in the future due to new developments or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we believe that all claims currently pending are either adequately covered by insurance or would not have a material adverse effect on the company s business or financial condition 
advertising 
under our license agreements  each drive in  either company owned or franchise  must contribute a minimum percentage of revenues to a national media production fund sonic advertising fund and spend an additional minimum percentage of gross revenues on local advertising  either directly or through company required participation in advertising cooperatives 
a portion of the local advertising contributions is redistributed to a system marketing fund  which purchases advertising on national cable and broadcast networks and other national media and sponsorship opportunities 
see further description under item  marketing 
as stated in the terms of existing license agreements  these funds do not constitute assets of the company and the company acts with limited agency in the administration of these funds 
accordingly  neither the revenues and expenses nor the assets and liabilities of the advertising cooperatives  the sonic advertising fund  or the system marketing fund are included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
however  all advertising contributions by company owned restaurants are recorded as an expense in the company s financial statements 
revenue recognition related to franchise fees and royalties 
initial franchise fees are nonrefundable and are recognized in income when all material services or conditions relating to the sale of the franchise have been substantially performed or satisfied by the company 
area development fees are nonrefundable and are recognized in income on a pro rata basis when the conditions for revenue recognition under the individual development agreements are met 
both initial franchise fees and area development fees are generally recognized upon the opening of a franchise drive in or upon termination of the agreement between the company and the franchisee 
our franchisees are required under the provisions of the license agreements to pay the company royalties each month based on a percentage of actual net royalty sales 
however  the royalty payments and supporting financial statements are not due until the th of the following month 
as a result  we accrue royalty revenue in the month earned based on estimates of franchise store sales 
these estimates are based on actual sales at company owned stores and projections of average unit volume growth at franchise stores 
income taxes 
we provide for income taxes based on our estimate of federal and state tax liability 
in making this estimate  we consider the impact of legislative and judicial developments 
as these developments evolve  we will update our estimate which could result in an adjustment to the tax rate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates on debt and notes receivable  as well as changes in commodity prices 
our exposure to interest rate risk currently consists of our senior notes  outstanding line of credit  and notes receivable 
the senior notes bear interest at fixed rates which average 
the aggregate balance outstanding under the senior notes as of august  was million 
should interest rates increase or decrease  the estimated fair value of these notes would decrease or increase  respectively 
as of august   the estimated fair value of the senior notes exceeded the carrying amount by approximately million 
the line of credit bears interest at a rate benchmarked to us and european short term interest rates 
the balance outstanding under the line of credit was million as of august  we have made certain loans to the supervisors and managers who own a minority interest in our company owned restaurants and franchisees totaling million as of august  the interest rates on these notes are generally between and 
we believe the fair market value of these notes approximates their carrying amount 
the impact on our results of operations of a one percent interest rate change on the outstanding balances under the line of credit as of the end of fiscal year would be approximately million 
the company and its franchisees purchase certain commodities such as beef  potatoes  chicken and dairy products 
these commodities are generally purchased based upon market prices established with vendors 
these purchase arrangements may contain contractual features that limit the price paid by establishing price floors or caps  however  we have not made any long term commitments to purchase any minimum quantities under these arrangements 
we do not use financial instruments to hedge commodity prices because these purchase agreements help control the ultimate cost and any commodity price fluctuations are generally short term in nature 
this market risk discussion contains forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from this discussion based upon general market conditions and changes in financial markets
