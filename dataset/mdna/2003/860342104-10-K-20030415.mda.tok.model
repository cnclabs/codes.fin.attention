business segment highlights in thousands except percentages sales fiscal fiscal fiscal tactical vehicle systems power products distributed energy solutions petroleum equipment airline products other business activities total segment sales operating profit loss fiscal fiscal fiscal tactical vehicle systems power products distributed energy solutions petroleum equipment airline products other business activities total operating profit corporate expenses  net interest expense earnings from continuing operations before taxes operating profit loss as a percentage of sales fiscal fiscal fiscal tactical vehicle systems power products distributed energy solutions petroleum equipment airline products other business activities consolidated results of operations overview during fiscal  the company achieved a number of significant milestones 
corporate on october   we moved our stock listing to the new york stock exchange using the symbol svc 
we believe this change has provided our shareholders with greater market efficiency and our company greater visibility 
tactical vehicle systems the united states congress funded another one year extension to our existing contract to produce the family of medium tactical vehicles fmtv  extending production through september late in the year  we submitted our proposal to continue manufacture of the fmtv beyond the current contract 
the new contract  if awarded  would extend production for an additional four to five years beyond september we also submitted a proposal to the united kingdom s ministry of defence to supply over  cargo and support vehicles and provide products support for the next years 
power products we expanded our market reach in the power products segment by acquiring the right to distribute hyster equipment into additional areas of texas and new mexico 
formation of engineered products division we announced the consolidation of three manufacturing facilities into one location  creating the engineered products division 
in the first half of fiscal  we will consolidate the fabrication facilities associated with the petroleum equipment segment  distributed energy solutions segment  and the railcar mover and snowblower activities that are currently included in the airline products segment 
this consolidation effort is being taken in an effort to reduce operating costs  increase responsiveness to market opportunities and improve customer service 
the company anticipates that it will incur restructuring costs of approximately million and capital expenditures of million to achieve this consolidation 
once the consolidation is complete  the company anticipates annual cost savings of approximately million  of which the company expects to realize approximately million in fiscal petroleum equipment discontinued operations we completed the sale of the petroleum equipment segment s blowout preventer  valve and drilling riser business that we discontinued at the end of fiscal fiscal vs 
fiscal fiscal sales totaled  million  representing a decrease compared to fiscal sales of  million 
net earnings from continuing operations for fiscal were million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share for fiscal  excluding a one time gain of million after tax associated with settlements with the us army related to our tactical vehicle systems segment 
including this one time gain  fiscal earnings were million  or per diluted share 
after the effect of discontinued operations and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting  the net loss for fiscal was million  or per diluted share  compared to net earnings for fiscal of million  or diluted share 
tactical vehicle systems the tactical vehicle systems segment assembles the family of medium tactical vehicles under contracts with the us army  and provides sustaining design engineering  service and support 
the tactical vehicle systems segment sales in fiscal increased to million  compared to million in fiscal total operating profit for fiscal was million compared to fiscal operating profit of million  which included million pre tax settlement of claims  net of expenses  with the us army  as further described below 
the increase in sales in fiscal was primarily due to an increase in the volume of trucks delivered during the year 
in fiscal   trucks were shipped compared to  trucks during fiscal operating profit for fiscal was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal  excluding the impact of the one time settlements of claims with the us army 
this increase in sales  operating profit and operating profit percentage was largely due to the increased volume of truck shipments and improved operating efficiency 
the us army exercised an option to award a sixth program year to the current contract  which added million to the backlog for this segment during the fourth quarter of fiscal deliveries under this additional year are expected to begin in october and to be completed by september shipments for fiscal are anticipated to be approximately  trucks and trailers 
in fiscal  we filed a claim with the us government seeking recovery of costs incurred resulting from a delay of over eight months from the original production plan in the first multi year fmtv contract 
the parties reached resolution in april through the alternative dispute resolution process managed by the armed services board of contract appeals and we received payment of million  net of related expenses  in july in addition  in fiscal  we filed a claim with the us government seeking recovery of costs incurred from retrofitting all vehicles produced under the first fmtv contract for changes in drive train components 
all costs associated with the retrofitting had been expensed in prior years 
the parties reached resolution through an alternate dispute resolution proceeding and the us army paid million to us  net of expenses  in december the us government is the primary customer of the tactical vehicle systems segment  accounting for practically all of the sales of the segment 
the fmtv contracts are subject to termination at the election of the customer and provide for termination charges that would reimburse us for allowable costs  but not necessarily all costs 
the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our future financial condition and results of operations 
the fmtv incorporates engines  transmissions  axles and a number of other components specified by the us army and available only from the source or sources selected by the us army 
interruption of the supply of any of these components could have a material adverse effect on the results of operations of the tactical vehicles systems segment 
we believe that any delays arising from the unavailability of source specified components would be compensated under the fmtv contracts 
in november  we submitted our bid to the us army as part of the competitive bid process for the next multi year fmtv contract 
the us army is expected to make its decision as to the final award of the new production contract by the end of april this contract award is valued at approximately billion  depending upon options  with production of over  trucks and trailers over a four or five year period 
production by the successful bidder is expected to begin in october if we do receive the award  we believe that our profit margins will likely be lower than historical levels for the existing fmtv contract 
further  as the next multi year contract award is for fewer trucks to be produced per fiscal year  revenue is projected to be lower relating to this contract  unless the us army exercises options for additional production 
we believe that if we are awarded the next multi year fmtv contract  the award would increase our likelihood of being awarded additional us government contracts in the future 
in january  we submitted an amended bid to the united kingdom s ministry of defence uk mod  for their multi year production contract for over  trucks 
we cannot reliably predict when the uk mod will make its decision as to the final award of the production contract or whether we will receive the award 
this segment is highly dependent on securing additional contracts  after completion of the current contract for production of the fmtv  at acceptable operating margins 
power products the power products segment sells and rents various industrial equipment  sells components  replacement parts  accessories and other materials supplied by independent manufacturers  and provides in shop and on site repair services for industrial  transportation  marine  construction  power generation and material handling equipment 
sales for the power products segment in fiscal decreased to million  compared to million in fiscal throughout fiscal  we continued to operate in a challenging marketplace characterized by a relatively weak economy 
both equipment and parts sales were lower in the current year versus the prior year  partially offset by an increase in service sales 
the lower equipment and parts sales are largely attributable to the overall weakness in the markets we serve 
specifically  our oil and gas customers have delayed spending  consequently reducing the overall demand for our products in this market 
our over the highway customers are faced with increased costs associated with insurance  fuel and environmental regulation compliance  resulting in downward pricing pressure for our parts and equipment 
finally  the power generation market we serve is also characterized by low demand  resulting from a build up of capacity in recent years 
as a result of these lower sales levels and an unfavorable mix between equipment sales  rentals  parts and service  we did not cover our fixed costs in the current year  resulting in the fiscal operating loss of million  compared to the fiscal operating profit of million 
fiscal results included a credit of million to cost of sales due to a lower lifo inventory reserve  compared to a million credit in fiscal at current activity levels  our plan to improve our performance in the power products segment includes reducing costs compared to fiscal this plan includes the impact of workforce reductions and management information systems implementation and training costs incurred in fiscal  and the creation of a shared administrative service center 
in addition  we expect continued productivity improvements from our backroom consolidation effort  increased service department productivity and efficiencies resulting from the management information system to yield further margin improvement 
however  until the sales volume returns to a higher level than currently being realized  operating margin rates will continue to be lower than those achieved historically 
we maintain operating locations in colombia and venezuela and are monitoring the emerging political and economic developments in those countries 
as of january   our total investment in inventory and fixed assets in these countries was less than million 
distributed energy solutions the distributed energy solutions segment packages reciprocating diesel and natural gas engine generator sets  installs and services power plant operations on a turnkey basis  and markets power generation solutions in domestic and certain international markets 
sales for the distributed energy solutions segment decreased to million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal during fiscal  we experienced higher than normal demand for our large scale power generation products as a result of power shortages in california 
despite the lower sales volume  this segment s operating loss in fiscal was reduced to million compared to a million loss in fiscal fiscal results included a credit of million to cost of sales due to a lower lifo inventory reserve  compared to a charge of million in fiscal fiscal results also included the substantial completion of a large  profitable project to provide the us navy with standby power units for its next new nuclear powered aircraft carrier 
we had in our backlog over million of orders as of the end of fiscal this segment s ability to operate above a breakeven point during fiscal is largely dependent upon converting the orders in backlog to sales and securing additional large dollar projects that are currently in the sales pipeline 
because the contracts in this segment tend to be large in volume and unpredictable as to timing  large quarterly swings in the financial results for this segment could occur 
as previously announced  in the first half of fiscal  we will be consolidating the houston  texas operations of the distributed energy solutions business with those of the petroleum equipment segment  also in houston 
demand for the products and services offered by this segment is lower than it has been in recent years 
in addition  inventory levels in the market are relatively high 
the combination of these two factors has led to intense price competition in the industry  which we expect to continue in the near future 
as of the end of fiscal  inventory levels in this segment remain at higher than optimal levels  leaving opportunities for cash generation through the reduction of working capital in fiscal petroleum equipment the petroleum equipment segment manufactures equipment primarily for the well stimulation segment of the oil service industry 
its products include coil tubing systems and acidizing and fracturing systems 
at the end of fiscal  we announced our intention to sell this segment s blowout preventer and controls  valve  and drilling riser business  and as a result  these activities were reclassified for reporting purposes as discontinued operations and are not included in the results of this segment 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we completed this sale and continue to classify any activities associated with completing retained contracts as discontinued operations 
see discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle for further discussion 
sales for the petroleum equipment segment totaled million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the segment reported a million operating loss in fiscal compared to a million operating profit for fiscal during the first half of fiscal  the continuing operations of this segment were disrupted by the sale of the blowout preventer and controls  valve and drilling riser business discussed above 
during the second half of fiscal  however  a comparatively large number of profitable international orders were filled 
as mentioned above  during the first half of fiscal  we expect to consolidate certain operating locations of both the distributed energy solutions and the petroleum equipment segments at one location in houston  texas 
the worldwide rig count at the end of february  as reported by baker hughes incorporated  increased approximately compared to february  and the drilling rig count and workover rig count in north america increased approximately and  respectively  for the same period 
these indicators of increased activity in the petroleum industry were also reflected in the increase in the backlog in the petroleum equipment segment to million at january   up from million at january  at the current level of activity and order rate  this segment is expected to continue to generate positive operating profit and profit margins more in line with historical rates for fiscal airline products the airline products segment manufactures internal combustion and electric propulsion airline ground support equipment that includes aircraft tow tractors  gate pushback tractors  baggage tow tractors  beltloaders  air start units and air conditioning units 
this segment also manufactures mobile railcar movers and snow blowers 
sales in the airline products segment for fiscal were million  compared to million in fiscal the operating loss for fiscal was million  which included an asset impairment charge of million  compared to an operating loss of million in fiscal excluding the asset impairment charge described below  the operating loss decreased to million in fiscal despite the lower sales volume  reflecting a reduction of fixed expenses  largely attributable to the consolidation of manufacturing facilities in georgia in the second half of fiscal the airline industry encountered multiple challenges during fiscal  including economic recession  terrorist activities  the threat of war with iraq  overall decreased consumer demand and high fuel prices 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the likelihood of war became more imminent  there was a heightened risk of terrorist activities and the airlines overall sentiment regarding their current and future operations continued to decline 
in light of these continuing challenges and the history of operating losses for this segment  we tested the segment s long lived assets and goodwill for impairment as of january  in accordance with sfas no 
and sfas no 
we calculated the fair value of these long lived assets based on the present value of estimated future cash flows from the airline products segment 
as a result of this analysis  we fully impaired the net carrying value of property  plant and equipment million and goodwill and other intangibles million related to the airline products segment as of january  since september  we have taken aggressive measures to reduce costs  including personnel reductions  optimizing facility locations and increasing downtime 
in addition  we have taken action to expand and diversify our product line and to increase our sales in the military and industrial sectors 
in december  we acquired the assets of davco industries  a manufacturer of aircraft ground support equipment specifically designed for the regional airline markets  for cash of million 
we do not expect a return to breakeven performance in fiscal  but we do expect a reduced level of operating losses than we incurred in fiscal other business activities other business activities not identified in a specific segment do not represent a significant portion of our business operations going forward 
this segment primarily included sales of gas compression equipment  a business we exited in fiscal  and corporate interest income of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
fiscal vs 
fiscal fiscal sales totaled  million compared to  million in fiscal net earnings from continuing operations for the year grew to million  or per diluted share  compared with million  or per diluted share  in the prior year 
including discontinued operations  total year net earnings for fiscal and were million  or per diluted share  and million  or per diluted share  respectively 
tactical vehicle systems the tactical vehicle systems segment recorded sales for fiscal of million versus million in fiscal total operating profit for fiscal was million  which compared favorably with million in fiscal included in the fiscal operating profit is million in settlement of claims  net of expenses of million  with the us army  as discussed previously 
the increase in sales in fiscal was due to an increase in the volume of products shipped during the year 
in fiscal   trucks and trailers were shipped compared to  trucks and no trailers for the comparable period of fiscal power products sales for the power products segment in fiscal were million  higher than fiscal sales of million  largely due to higher service sales 
we increased the number of service technicians in this segment and focused on the service aspect of this business 
while equipment sales increased modestly year over year  the trend was downward during the fourth quarter  reflecting weakness in selected markets such as oil and gas  material handling  and small power generation equipment 
this market softness was reflected in the equipment order backlog  which decreased million during the year 
parts sales remained steady but were impacted by the retirement of the two cycle engine in the marine market 
operating profit for fiscal was million compared with million for fiscal a million improvement from higher volume was more than offset by million higher expense related to information systems improvements  million of expense related to collectibility of certain accounts receivable  million in inventory valuation adjustments net of a lower lifo reserve which decreased cost of sales by million  and million higher costs due to inflation and other factors 
overall  margin rates on equipment were down while margin rates on parts and service sales remained consistent with prior periods 
distributed energy solutions sales for the distributed energy solutions segment in fiscal were million compared to million in the prior year 
the increase in sales was primarily due to two large turnkey power generation projects in california that were completed in the first half of fiscal an operating loss of million was recorded in fiscal compared to a million operating loss in fiscal the million impact of higher gross margins due to increased volume was more than offset by cost structure increases in houston million and sacramento million  million lifo provisions associated with an inventory increase  million in warranty expenses  and million for restructuring and other costs 
petroleum equipment at the end of fiscal  we announced our intention to sell the petroleum equipment segment s blowout preventer and controls  valve  and drilling riser business  and as a result  these activities were reclassified for reporting purposes as discontinued operations and not included in the results of this segment 
see discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle below for further discussion 
the currently reported petroleum equipment segment manufactures equipment primarily for the well stimulation sector of the oil service industry 
sales for the petroleum equipment segment totaled million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the segment reported a million operating profit in fiscal compared to a million operating profit for fiscal the million benefit from increased volume was more than offset by million increased operating expense to support the increased volume  million in higher information systems expense  a million increase in product warranty costs and million restructuring costs 
airline products sales for the airline products segment for fiscal were million versus million in fiscal the operating loss for fiscal was million compared to an operating loss of million for fiscal the increase in operating loss was attributable to lower volume million  restructuring costs million associated with facility and organization consolidations  higher operating costs million associated with facility costs  ramp up of the snow blower business transferred to houston  texas  higher insurance and bad debt expense  and other costs 
these costs were partially offset by lower lifo reserves  which decreased cost of sales by million 
other business activities other business activities not identified in a specific segment primarily included sales of gas compression equipment  a business we exited in fiscal fiscal sales were million versus million in fiscal operating profit for fiscal totaled million versus million in fiscal  which included a million gain on the sale of the gas compression equipment leasing business 
period expenses in thousands  except percentages fiscal fiscal fiscal selling and administrative expenses interest expense other income  net net period expenses net period expenses as a percentage of sales net period expenses period expenses for fiscal totaled million  or of sales compared with million  or of sales in fiscal and million  or of sales in fiscal selling and administrative expenses for fiscal  and totaled million  million and million  respectively 
the million decrease during fiscal resulted from lower spending at the business unit level of million  primarily reflecting costs related to restructurings in fiscal that did not recur in fiscal  and a reduction in corporate spending  primarily related to management information systems 
the million increase during fiscal included an million increase in management information systems expenses  million in restructuring expenses and higher costs due to increased business activity 
interest expense declined during fiscal by million  as million of long term debt was repaid in the second quarter of fiscal  resulting in lower average debt balances outstanding year over year 
interest expense declined million in fiscal compared to fiscal due to debt reductions and capitalization of million of interest on major capital projects 
other income  net for fiscal included million of interest income  which is million lower than fiscal  as the average investment balance and the average rate earned on such investments were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal in fiscal  other income  net also included a million insurance recovery of damages from insurance carriers related to prior year claims 
other income  net  for fiscal included a million gain on sale of the gas compression leasing business 
discontinued operations and cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal loss from discontinued operations  net of tax gain loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  net of tax net earnings loss during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the petroleum equipment segment s blowout preventer and controls  valve and drilling riser business was not strategically aligned with our core competencies 
at the end of fiscal  we announced our intention to sell this business and  consequently  these activities were reclassified for reporting purposes for all periods shown as discontinued operations 
included in the net loss from discontinued operations for fiscal were higher costs associated with certain contracts  including operational inefficiencies due to the closure of the business 
also included in the loss from discontinued operations in fiscal is a million reserve million net of tax related to a million obligation to a financial institution in connection with a guarantee of a customer s base obligation for certain gas turbine equipment in argentina 
we are pursuing our rights under an export insurance credit policy procured in connection with the underlying transaction and our rights with the argentine end user of the equipment 
in the third quarter of fiscal  we completed the sale of the blowout preventer and controls  valve and drilling riser business mentioned above 
at that time  we recognized an after tax loss of million on the sale 
we anticipate that losses from these discontinued operations will continue until all unresolved matters are finalized 
we recorded an after tax gain of million in fiscal related to the prior year disposal of an investment and certain obligations relating to a power generation facility in argentina associated with the previously discontinued gas turbine operations 
accordingly  the gain was reflected as a gain on disposal of discontinued operations 
effective february   we adopted the financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for business combinations and sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other things  sfas no 
requires that the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives no longer be amortized to expense  but instead be tested at least annually for impairment 
upon adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recognized  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  a pre tax impairment charge of million to goodwill million after tax primarily related to the airline products segment and ceased amortization of the remaining unamortized goodwill 
our goodwill amortization for fiscal was million 
financial condition working capital in thousands  except for ratios january  january  current assets cash and cash equivalents accounts and notes receivable  net recoverable costs and accrued profits not yet billed inventories income tax receivable deferred income tax asset other current assets total assets of discontinued operations total current assets current liabilities notes payable current portion of long term debt accounts payable accrued payrolls and incentives income taxes payable billings in excess of incurred costs other current liabilities total liabilities of discontinued operations total current liabilities working capital current ratio during fiscal  current assets decreased by million 
cash and cash equivalents increased million due to million in cash from operations generated during fiscal offset by million used in investing activities and million used in financing activities 
see liquidity and capital resources below for further discussion 
accounts and notes receivable decreased million due to the timing of receipts from the us government  retention on certain turnkey projects and other timing of collections 
recoverable costs and accrued profits not yet billed increased as large contracts in the petroleum equipment segment and the distributed energy solutions segment  which are accounted for on the percentage of completion method  were in process and not yet invoiced 
inventories increased million  principally in the airline products segment  as sales order activity slowed in the second half of fiscal income taxes receivable decreased by million  as we received a refund from the internal revenue service early in fiscal assets of discontinued operations decreased substantially as such businesses were sold in fiscal current liabilities increased by million during fiscal principally due to a million increase in the current portion of long term debt 
this traunch of our private placement is due to be repaid in may in addition  accounts payable  accruals and other current liabilities decreased by million primarily due to the timing of payments 
billings in excess of costs  which almost entirely related to our tactical vehicle systems segment  increased by million due to timing of receipts from the u 
s government versus the timing of expenditures associated with the fmtv contract 
non current assets in thousands january  january  property  plant and equipment  net excluding rental equipment rental equipment  net deferred income tax asset intangibles and other assets  net non current assets increased by million during fiscal  primarily as a result of increased deferred tax assets  reflecting the impact of losses recorded for book purposes that are not yet deductible for tax 
with respect to property  plant and equipment  the impact of the final completion of both a new facility in dallas  texas in the power products segment and a new fabrication facility in the tactical vehicle systems segment was largely offset by the impairment of long lived assets and goodwill in the airline products segment 
long term liabilities and equity january  january  in thousands amount percentage amount percentage long term debt excluding current portion other long term liabilities  excluding long term debt shareholders equity total long term liabilities and shareholders equity decreased by million during fiscal  principally due to the reclassification of million of debt due may to current liabilities 
other long term liabilities increased by million  almost all of which related to an increase in our accrued pension benefit obligation 
of this amount  million was due to an increase in additional minimum pension liability 
shareholders equity decreased by million as a result of million of other comprehensive loss  principally related to an increase in the tax affected additional minimum pension liability  million of dividend payments  and million of net loss 
liquidity and capital resources our sources of cash liquidity include cash and cash equivalents  cash from operations  amounts available under credit facilities and other external sources of funds 
we believe that these sources are sufficient to fund the current requirements of working capital  capital expenditures  dividends and other financial commitments 
we have a million unsecured revolving credit facility  which matures on january  no borrowings were outstanding under the facility at any time during fiscal or fiscal the revolving credit facility has a million sub facility  which may be used for letters of credit 
approximately million in letters of credit under the revolving credit facility were outstanding at january  pursuant to covenant limitations of the revolving credit facility  approximately million was available for borrowing at january  a commitment fee ranging from to basis points is paid on the daily average unused balance based on our leverage ratio 
borrowings outstanding would bear interest at several options  including libor plus to basis points based on our leverage ratio  the prime rate  or a competitive bid among the banks 
based on the first option libor plus to basis points based on our leverage ratio  the borrowing rate would have been approximately as of january  we intend to negotiate an extension of the revolving credit facility on similar terms and conditions prior to its expiration in january there can be no assurance that we will be able to successfully negotiate such an extension or  if we do  that such extension will include similar terms and conditions  rates of interest and covenants 
although no borrowings are currently outstanding under the revolving credit facility  failure to negotiate a new facility on terms acceptable to us could restrict our future ability to make acquisitions and fund working capital  capital expenditures  common stock dividends or other financial obligations 
in addition  we have million in senior notes outstanding 
the senior notes are unsecured and were issued pursuant to an agreement containing a covenant  which imposes a debt to total capitalization requirement 
of this million amount  million is due and payable in may and is classified on our consolidated statement of financial position as current portion of long term debt 
we currently intend to repay this obligation with available cash on hand 
other available sources of cash  including capacity under the revolving credit facility  are available to fund this obligation 
the remaining million is due and payable in may for additional information  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
in fiscal  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement  which expires in fiscal  with a notional amount of million related to million of the senior notes due in this transaction  which is designated as a fair value hedge  effectively converts million of fixed rate debt with an interest rate of into floating rate debt with an interest rate of libor plus basis points 
the applicable floating interest rate as of january  was approximately 
the net interest received or paid as a result of the interest rate swap is included in interest expense on the consolidated statements of earnings 
the recorded value of the swap and the related debt are carried on the consolidated statements of financial position at fair value 
the revolving credit facility and the senior notes mentioned above were issued pursuant to agreements containing covenants that restrict indebtedness  guarantees  sales of assets  rentals and other items 
additional covenants in the revolving credit facility require us to maintain a minimum tangible net worth and interest coverage 
since these requirements are calculated from earnings and cash flow  our ability to declare and pay dividends could be restricted indirectly 
based on our financial condition as of january   the restrictions imposed by our debt instruments do not currently restrict our ability to declare and pay dividends at historical levels 
in addition  our international subsidiaries had foreign currency bank notes payable totaling million and million at january  and  respectively 
such notes payable consist of renewable  secured loans for the purpose of financing our south american operations 
these loans are denominated in local currency colombian pesos and venezuelan bolivars and are secured by letters of credit issued by us and principally bear market based variable rates of interest  which were approximately and as of january  and  respectively 
we use foreign denominated debt to offset the impact of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations on our south american operations 
we have additional banking relationships  which provide uncommitted borrowing arrangements 
in the event that any acquisition of additional operations  growth in existing operations  settlements of lawsuits or disputes  changes in inventory levels  accounts receivable  tax payments or other working capital items create a permanent need for working capital or capital expenditures in excess of the existing cash and cash equivalents and committed lines of credit  we may seek to borrow under other long term financing instruments or seek additional equity capital

the company currently anticipates the capital spending in fiscal will be to million  including to million related to consolidation of the engineered products division fabrication facilities 
included in the million of acquisition of businesses in fiscal are two acquisitions completed in the fourth quarter 
we acquired the assets of davco industries  inc  a supplier of regional and governmental airline ground support equipment  for million 
these products have been integrated into the airline products segment operations in georgia 
anticipated annual sales volume from this product line is approximately million 
we also acquired the franchise for the hyster forklift truck territory that includes five texas counties in the el paso  texas area as well as the entire state of new mexico for million 
we currently hold the hyster franchise for most of the state of texas and now new mexico 
this acquisition is expected to add approximately million of annual revenue to the power products segment 
net investing activities of discontinued operations in fiscal primarily included proceeds of million from the sale of our blowout preventer and controls  valve and drilling riser business  partially offset by an expenditure of million to satisfy a gas turbine guarantee obligation in argentina 
during fiscal and  we invested significant amounts of cash in property  plant and equipment to expand our existing business 
included in fiscal are expenditures for a new fabrication facility in the tactical vehicle systems segment  equipment and leasehold improvements related to a new facility in georgia for the airline products segment  and expenditures related to a new facility in dallas for the power products segment 
also included in fiscal and were million and million  respectively  of expenditures related to our new enterprise resource planning software and capitalizable implementation costs 
during fiscal  we received million in cash associated with the sale of our john deere franchise and the final payment related to the sale of our gas compression business sold in the prior year  both in the power products segment 
during fiscal  we received million in cash associated with the divestiture of our gas compression equipment leasing business 
in fiscal  our tactical vehicle systems segment acquired extended reach logistics  inc  an e commerce business for million in cash plus additional potential performance payments 
net cash provided by used in financing activities in thousands fiscal fiscal fiscal additions to long term borrowings payments on long term borrowings net short term borrowings payments dividends paid proceeds from exercise of stock options net cash used in financing activities during fiscal  we paid common stock dividends of million  or per share 
there have been no changes in the dividend rate per share during the years presented 
we generally use funds from operations to pay such dividends 
declaration and payment of dividends in the future is dependent upon our earnings and liquidity position  among other factors 
proceeds from exercise of stock options during fiscal decreased compared to due to generally as a result of lower stock prices which resulted in a lower level of stock option exercises 
during fiscal  we paid down million of long term borrowings of which million related to senior notes from a private placement in prior fiscal periods 
in fiscal  million of short term debt was also paid  substantially all of which was related to a financing arrangement for equipment inventory 
proceeds from exercise of stock options at fiscal increased due to generally higher stock prices  which resulted in a greater level of stock option exercises 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we occasionally enter into certain financing arrangements in the ordinary course of business  including non cancelable operating leases  letters of credit and debt guarantees 
we enter into operating leases for some of our facility and equipment needs 
such lease arrangements enable us to conserve cash by paying monthly lease rental fees for the applicable assets rather than purchasing them 
at the end of the lease period  we have no further obligation to the lessor 
if we decide to cancel or terminate a lease prior to the end of its term  we are typically obligated to pay the remaining lease payments over the term of the lease  and in certain cases may be allowed to sublet the asset to another party 
we are occasionally required to issue performance indemnities or to post letters of credit  generally issued by a bank  to collateralize certain insurance programs  to secure credit facilities or to ensure performance under contracts 
a letter of credit commits the issuer to remit specified amounts to the holder  if the holder demonstrates that we have failed to meet our obligations under the letter of credit 
if this were to occur  we would be obligated to reimburse the issuer for any payments the issuer was required to remit to the holder of the letter of credit 
generally  a letter of credit is released when we have satisfied the obligations that the letter of credit is securing 
we occasionally provide certain guarantees in support of our customers financing of purchases from us in the form of debt guarantees 
pursuant to such guarantees  once the customer has satisfied its debt obligation to the lender  our guarantee is released 
should a customer fail to meet its obligation to the lender  the lender could require us to satisfy such obligation  in which case we would have some legal recourse against the customer 
our contractual obligations at january  are summarized as follows in thousands less than one year fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total long term debt obligations notes payable operating leases total contractual cash obligations in addition  our other commercial commitments expire as follows in thousands less than one year fiscal fiscal fiscal fiscal thereafter total letters of credit contingent performance indemnities debt guarantees employee defined benefit plans we have a noncontributory defined benefit pension plan covering substantially all of our full time employees 
the pension benefits are based on years of service  limited to years  and the employee s highest consecutive five year average compensation out of the last years of employment 
we fund pension costs in conformity with the funding requirements of applicable government regulations 
the assets of our pension plan  like numerous other companies plans  are  to a substantial degree  invested in the capital markets and managed by a third party under the review of our pension plan committee 
given the performance of the stock market during recent history  we were required to reflect an additional minimum pension liability of million in our fiscal financial statements as a result of a decline in the value of the assets held by our pension plan 
minimum pension liability adjustments are non cash adjustments that are reflected as an increase in pension liability with an offsetting charge to shareholders equity net of income tax through comprehensive income rather than net income 
we also anticipate that the decline in the value of the pension plan assets will result in higher future pension costs 
however  absent a decision by us to increase our contributions to the pension plan as a result of the fiscal asset performance  such asset performance is not expected to have a material impact on our near term liquidity as pension funding requirements generally allow for such impacts to be spread over multiple years 
increases in post fiscal pension funding requirements could occur  however  if capital market performance in future periods does not more closely approximate the long term rate of return assumed by us  and the amount of such increases could be material 
the calculation of expense associated with our pension plan is dependent on key assumptions  including the long term discount rate  the expected rate of return on plan assets  and the assumed rate of compensation increases 
during fiscal  we changed the assumed discount rate used for this calculation from in fiscal to 
this decision was based on the trending in the monthly average moody s mergent s corporate aa yields and the monthly average year treasury rates 
in addition  we reduced the assumed rate of compensation increase for our employee population by point  from to based on more recent actual data and the expectation that long term rates of compensation increase should approximate growth in overall gross domestic product 
consistent with prior years  we used in fiscal as our expected long term rate of return on plan assets 
this is based on an actuarial estimate of returns over a year time horizon based on our pension plan s long term asset allocation strategy using geometric averaging 
while we believe that these assumptions are reasonable for fiscal  we will continue to evaluate the reasonableness of our actuarial assumptions for their applicability in the fiscal actuarial analysis 
if we decrease the expected long term rate of return on plan assets assumption by basis points  the pension expense we would recognize would increase by million 
if we were to decrease the discount rate by basis points  the pension expense we would recognize would increase by approximately million 
during fiscal  and we recognized million  million and million  respectively  of expense associated with our defined benefit pension plan 
during those same three years  we contributed million  million and million of funding  respectively 
based on the best available information we have at this time  we expect that in fiscal we will contribute approximately million to our defined benefit pension plan and recognize million of pension expense 
these pro forma estimates include a discount rate of  an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and a rate of compensation increase 
in addition to our defined benefit pension plan  we have a defined benefit postretirement medical plan  which covers most of our employees and provides for the payment of medical costs of eligible employees and dependents upon retirement 
the plan is currently not funded 
we expect to continue paying postretirement medical costs as covered claims are incurred 
like the pension plans discussed above  the defined benefit postretirement medical plan is dependent on key assumptions 
for this actuarial calculation  we have also used a discount rate of 
another key assumption in this actuarial calculation is the assumed future health care cost trend rates 
we have assumed an annual rate of increase of approximately in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits for fiscal the rate is assumed to moderate to through and remain at that level thereafter 
this estimate of future medical cost growth was based on the assumption that the rate of medical cost increases would eventually level off and that growth in these costs would eventually approximate the overall growth in gross domestic product 
given more recent data  however  we are re evaluating this assumption 
when we initiate our actuarial calculation of the fiscal expense  we expect to assume a fiscal growth rate of over  eventually and gradually decreasing to by and remaining at that level thereafter 
if we had increased our medical growth assumptions by basis points in fiscal  the effect on total service and interest cost components would have been approximately million 
while we currently believe the existing discount rate of is appropriate for the fiscal estimate  if we were to decrease the discount rate by basis points  the effect on total service and interest cost components we would recognize would increase by million 
critical accounting policies preparation of financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts and related disclosures during the period 
we evaluate our estimates on an on going basis  based on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by us  additional adjustments to reserve items might be required 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical and pervasive accounting policies we use  and the areas most sensitive to material change from external factors 
revenue recognition generally  revenue is recognized when contract terms are met  collectibility is reasonably assured and a product is shipped or risk of ownership has been transferred to and accepted by the customer 
with respect to long term construction contracts  revenue is recognized using the percentage of completion method in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts 
measurement of progress toward completion is based on units of production for the fmtv contracts in the tactical vehicle systems segment  and typically based on direct labor hours for other percentage of completion contracts 
changes in estimates for revenues  costs to complete and profit margins are recognized in the period in which they are reasonably determinable 
any anticipated losses on uncompleted contracts are recognized whenever evidence indicates that the estimated total cost of a contract exceeds its estimated total revenue 
warranty based on historical experience and contract terms  we provide for the estimated cost of product and service warranties at the time of sale or  in some cases  when specific warranty problems are identified 
accrued warranty costs are adjusted periodically to reflect actual experience 
certain warranty and other related claims involve matters of dispute that ultimately are resolved by negotiation  arbitration or litigation 
occasionally  a material warranty issue can arise that is beyond our historical experience 
we provide for any such warranty issues as they become known and estimable 
should actual product failure rates or repair costs differ from our current estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts we extend credit and credit enhancements to customers and other parties in the normal course of business and maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
we base such estimates on our historical experience and any specific customer collection issues we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we might not continue to experience the same credit loss rates we have in the past 
circumstances in some of the industries in which our customers operate may affect their operating performance and cash flows  which in turn might affect our ability to collect our accounts receivable 
as circumstances develop  the financial condition of specific customers changes or additional information becomes available  adjustments to the allowance for doubtful accounts may be required 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost generally determined on a last in  first out lifo basis  and market determined on the basis of estimated realizable values  less related customer deposits 
work in process costs include material  labor and overhead 
when circumstances dictate  we write inventory down to its estimated realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand  technological innovations  market conditions and the physical condition of products 
if circumstances change  causing us to reduce our estimate of realizable value for specific inventory items or categories  additional provisions to cost of sales may be required 
asset impairment we assess the valuation of components of our property  plant and equipment and other long lived assets whenever events or circumstances dictate that the carrying value might not be recoverable 
we base our evaluation on indicators such as the nature of the assets  the future economic benefit of the assets  any historical or future profitability measurements and other external market conditions or factors that may be present 
if such factors indicate that the carrying amount of an asset or asset group may not be recoverable  we determine whether impairment has occurred by analyzing an estimate of undiscounted future cash flows at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows exist 
if our estimate of undiscounted future cash flows during the estimated useful life of the asset is less than the carrying value of the asset  we recognize a loss for the difference between the carrying value of the asset and its estimated fair value  generally measured by the present value of estimated future cash flows 
deferred income tax assets we record deferred tax assets and liabilities for differences between the book basis and tax basis of our net assets 
we record a valuation allowance  when appropriate  to adjust deferred tax asset balances to the amount we expect to realize 
we consider the amount of taxable income available in carryback years  future taxable income and potential tax planning strategies in assessing the potential need for a valuation allowance 
should we determine that we will not likely realize all or part of our net deferred income tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset balance would be charged to the income tax provision in the period such determination is made 
insurance we maintain a variety of insurance for our operations that we believe to be customary and reasonable 
although we believe we currently maintain insurance coverage that is adequate for the risks involved  there is always a risk that our insurance may not be sufficient to cover any particular loss or that our insurance may not cover all losses 
for example  it is possible that an adverse product liability claim could arise in excess of our coverage 
in addition  insurance rates and availability are subject to wide fluctuation  and changes in our coverage and the insurance industry could result in increases in our insurance cost and higher deductibles and retentions 
we are self insured up to certain levels in the form of deductibles and retentions for general liability  vehicle liability  group medical and workers compensation claims 
in addition  we do not maintain insurance for some business risks and potential exposures for which insurance is not available or not financially cost effective 
we accrue for estimated self insurance costs and uninsured exposures based on estimated development of claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
we regularly review estimates of reported and unreported claims and provide for losses accordingly 
although we believe that adequate reserves have been provided for expected liabilities arising from our self insured obligations  uninsured claims and exposures  our estimates of these liabilities may change as claims develop  and adjustments to reserves may be required 
pensions and other postretirement benefits we account for our defined benefit pension plan and our defined benefit postretirement medical plan in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions  respectively 
these standards require that amounts recognized in the financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
significant elements in determining our pension and other postretirement benefit expense include the expected return on plan assets  expected medical cost and compensation increases  and the discount rate for calculating future liability 
see employee defined benefit plans for further discussion 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for acquired goodwill and other intangible assets 
among other things  sfas no 
requires that the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite lives no longer be amortized to expense  but instead be tested at least annually for impairment 
upon adoption of sfas no 
in the first quarter of fiscal  we recognized  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  a pre tax impairment charge of million to goodwill million after tax  primarily related to the airline products segment and ceased amortization on the remaining unamortized goodwill 
see note in the consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein for further discussion 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
sfas no 
requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred and can be reasonably estimated 
such asset retirement costs are to be capitalized as part of the carrying value of the related long lived asset and depreciated over the asset s estimated useful life 
we have adopted sfas no 
as of february  we do not believe adoption of the new standard will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which supersedes both sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 for the disposal of a business 
sfas no 
provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be sold and addresses significant implementation issues of sfas no 
the new rules also broaden the criteria regarding classification of a discontinued operation 
we adopted sfas no 
in fiscal and as a result classified certain operations to be sold as discontinued operations 
in fiscal  in accordance with sfas no 
 we recorded a charge of million to impair the long lived assets of the airline products segment 
see notes and in the consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein for further discussion 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which requires companies to recognize costs associated with plant closings or other exit or disposal activities when incurred 
previous guidance required recognition of such costs as a liability as of the date an entity commits to an exit plan 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  adoption of the new standard will impact the timing of liability recognition related to future exit or disposal activities  but will not have a material effect on our ultimate costs associated with such activities 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligations undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
fin no 
also expands the disclosures required to be made by a guarantor about its obligation under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the recognition provisions of fin no 
do not apply to product warranties 
initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin no 
are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued after december  the disclosure requirements are effective immediately 
see note in the consolidated financial statements elsewhere herein 
we do not expect the recognition provisions of fin no 
will have a material effect on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  by providing alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock options and other stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting used for stock based compensation and its effect on reported results 
sfas no 
is effective in fiscal  and has no impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fin no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which requires that a company that controls another entity through interests other than voting interests should consolidate such controlled entity 
fin no 
applies to variable interest entities created after january   and is effective for interim periods beginning after june  for existing variable interest entities 
as we have no material exposures to special purpose entities or other off balance sheet arrangements  we anticipate that the effects of adopting fin no 
will not be material to our consolidated financial statements 
factors that may affect future results cautionary statements certain of the statements contained in this document  including those made under the captions business  legal proceedings  and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  are forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of other than statements of historical fact included herein  all statements herein  including in particular  but not limited to  statements regarding potential future products and markets  our future financial position or results of operations  business strategy  other plans  and objectives for future operations  relating to trends  expressing our belief  referring to expectations  referring to backlogs as to future product deliveries  relating to long term contracts in progress or using the words should  could  may  and words of similar import and prospective focus  are forward looking statements 
we can give no assurance that any forward looking statement of ours will prove to have been correct and such statements are not guarantees of future performance 
they involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that are difficult to predict  and actual outcomes and results may differ materially from what is expressed or forecasted or implied in such forward looking statements 
the company undertakes no obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
specific important factors that could cause actual results  performance  or achievements to differ materially from our forward looking statements  and that otherwise may affect our operations  are identified below 
all written and oral forward looking statements attributable to us or to persons acting on our behalf are expressly qualified in their entirety by such factors 
risk of competition 
our foreign and domestic competitors may use their resources and product and service offerings to increase competition  both in prices and products and services offered  and thereby reduce our market shares and or sales and profitability 
some of our existing and potential competitors have substantially greater marketing  financial  and technical resources than we have  and these resources may be used in effective competition with us 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will continue to be a reasonably effective competitor in our markets 
risks relating to technology 
our business will suffer if we are unable to keep up with rapid technological change and product development 
our success will depend on our ability to anticipate changes in technology and industry requirements and to respond to technological developments on a timely basis  either internally or through strategic alliances 
we will likely be constantly threatened by current competitors or new market entrants who may develop new technologies or products or establish new standards that could render our products less marketable or obsolete 
thus  we can offer no assurances that we will be successful in developing and marketing  on a timely and cost effective basis  products or product enhancements that respond to our competition  to technological developments  to changing industry standards  and to market place acceptability 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we can reasonably keep pace with our competitors in technology changes and product development 
risks of general economic conditions 
our commercial operations are cyclical and dependent for success on the general economic well being of the united states and certain other world markets 
a general economic downturn could adversely affect demand for our products and services 
in and  there was a marked period of economic slowdown  and there are still some signs that we are in a period of a world economic slowdown and world wide economic uncertainty exists  particularly in light of the war in iraq and related factors 
if the united states or world economies decline or fail to recover  the demand for  and price of  our products and services could be adversely affected  thus adversely affecting our revenues  results of operations and cash flow 
further  other general market conditions such as increased inflation and higher interest rates could also adversely impact our revenues and results of operations 
in our forward looking statements we have assumed that a worldwide recession or material downturn in the united states economy  to the extent they may exist at present  will not continue or worsen and that we are not entering a new and significant down cycle in our markets or a period of significantly increasing inflation and interest rates 
risks of oil and gas industry economic conditions 
our petroleum equipment segment  as well as certain aspects of our power products and distributed energy solutions segments  are closely tied to the oil and gas industry in general and  in particular  to capital expenditures by oil and gas companies and companies providing services and manufactured products to the oil and gas industry 
capital expenditures by oil and gas companies have tended in the past to follow trends in the price of oil and natural gas  which have fluctuated widely in recent years and which were somewhat depressed particularly for natural gas in fiscal a sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by oil and gas companies and oil and gas service and manufacturing companies  as we have experienced in the most recent year and also in some other recent years  will likely lead to a drop in demand for products and services in our petroleum equipment segment as well as in our distributed energy solutions and power products segments  which also provide products and services used in connection with the exploration for and production of oil and gas 
any such drop will have an adverse effect on our revenues  results of operations and cash flow during the affected period  as it did during fiscal there are some recent modest signs of recovery in the oil and gas industry  and we have assumed in our forward looking statements that economic conditions in such industry will stabilize at least at present levels or improve and that capital expenditures in the industry will not continue to be unduly restrained in future periods 
risks of airline industry economic conditions 
our airline products segment is highly dependent upon the economic well being of the airline industry and was adversely affected in fiscal by serious difficulties in that industry  including difficulties arising following the terrorist attacks on the us in september capital and other general expenditures by airline companies are the principal source for demand for the products of our airline products segment 
should there be a sustained period of substantially reduced capital expenditures by airline companies and other companies that cater to the airline industry  the demand for our products in our airline products segment will drop and there will likely be an adverse effect on our results of operations and cash flow during the affected period  as there was in fiscal and fiscal in our forward looking statements we continue to be cautious as to the recovery of economic conditions in the airline and related industries and do not anticipate quick and or complete recovery 
further  we are unable to predict the effect of a current viral epidemic sars on air travel and the resultant effect on the airline business  although it appears to be adversely affecting air travel at present 
risks as to terrorist attacks on the us and their impact on the us economy 
while we are not yet able to evaluate fully the ongoing impacts of the terrorist attacks on the us which appear to have coincided with or contributed to a general downturn in the us economy  or the threat of further such incidents  such circumstances may continue to adversely affect our business in ways that we cannot yet identify 
however  both the past attacks and threats of future ones may adversely affect the demand for our products and services generally in addition to their specific impact on our segments that serve the oil and gas and airline industries 
our forward looking statements at present assume no further material impacts of such circumstances on the us or further deterioration on our affected business 
risks relating to personnel 
labor shortages and our inability to recruit and retain key employees and workers could limit our operations and increase our labor costs and  in turn  adversely affect our results of operations 
our manufacturing and service operations are substantially dependent upon our ability to recruit and retain key managers and qualified machinists  mechanics  factory workers  and other laborers 
a strong labor market can adversely impact us by limiting our manufacturing capacity or resulting in significantly increased wages and other benefits to attract additional key employees and workers 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will continue to be able to recruit and retain necessary personnel at overall costs that are comparable with our ability to produce revenues 
risks of dependence on government and failure to obtain new government contracts 
because the us government is one of our key customers  decreased government spending or termination of significant government programs could adversely affect our business 
our tactical vehicle systems segment depends largely on us government expenditures 
in recent years  government contracts in such segment have accounted for substantial percentages of our annual revenues and operating income 
we are currently in production year five of our second multi year contract with the us army for production of the fmtv that provides for continued production of the fmtv through september including currently exercised option years 
the funding of the new fmtv contract is subject to the inherent uncertainties of congressional appropriations 
as is typical of multi year defense contracts that may be canceled or adjusted by the government  the fmtv contract must be funded annually by the us army and may be terminated at any time for the convenience of the government 
as of january   funding in the amount of approximately billion for the fmtv contract had been authorized and appropriated by the us congress  million of which is allocated to future production under the existing contract 
if the fmtv contract is terminated  other than for our default in which event there could be serious adverse consequences and claims against us  including repayment of amounts classified as current liabilities on our balance sheet billed and received from the us army in excess of costs incurred and profits accrued and other monetary exposures  the contract includes a provision under which we will be reimbursed for certain allowable costs but not necessarily for all costs 
as our current contract with the us army for production of the fmtv is nearing completion  it will be necessary for us to secure additional contracts for us to have continued success in this segment 
we have been awarded a contract under the first phase of the competitive bid process for the next multi year contract for production of the fmtv and are currently competing for the final award 
the us army is scheduled to make its decision as to the final award of the next multi year contract by the end of april the us army will determine the award by a competitive bid process  and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in such regard or that the other competitor for the award will not be more successful than we will be in this or coming bids and awards for tactical vehicles 
if we do receive the award  we believe that margins will likely be lower than historical levels on the existing fmtv contract 
further  as the next multi year contract award is for fewer trucks to be produced per fiscal year  revenue is forecasted to be lower relating to this contract unless the us army exercises options for additional production 
moreover  there can be no assurance as to whether future governmental spending will adequately support our business in this area  and substantial decreases in government spending  the loss of the us government as a customer or the cancellation of key significant government programs could materially and adversely affect our operations 
even if government spending in general continues at current levels  we are not assured that we can compete effectively as to the receipt of specific government orders and contract awards or as to the timing thereof 
the us army is the predominant customer of our tactical vehicle systems segment  accounting for practically all of the sales of this segment 
the loss of this customer would have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial condition and results of operations 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed that we will continue to have satisfactory benefits from our government contracting business 
inherent risks of government contracts 
government contracts present us with numerous special risks that are inherent in their nature and that could adversely affect our operations 
government contracts are often relatively large in our business 
major contracts for military systems are performed over extended periods of time and are subject to changes in scope of work and delivery schedules 
pricing negotiations on changes and settlement of claims often extend over prolonged periods of time 
whether we are able to obtain ultimate profitability on military contracts that we may receive often depends on the eventual outcome of an equitable settlement of contractual issues with the us government  and  due to uncertainties inherent in the estimation and claim negotiation process  no assurances can be given that any estimates as to satisfactory profitability will be accurate 
moreover  estimates as to percentage of completion accounting on large government contracts can prove to have been incorrect 
variances between actual results and such estimates could be material 
furthermore  there are inherent risks in projecting actual costs on multi year government contracts because of unforeseen factors  including price and wage inflation and supply shortages 
our government contracting operations are subject to us government investigations of business practices and cost classifications and legal and administrative proceedings can flow from our practices 
under certain circumstances a contractor can be fined as well as suspended or debarred from government contracting 
suspension or debarment could prevent us from selling equipment or services to customers that depend on loans or financial commitments from other us government agencies such as the export import bank and the overseas private investment corporation 
in such events we might otherwise not be able to receive the benefits of federal assistance payments during a suspension or debarment 
in our forward looking statements  we have assumed our reasonable management of risks inherent in our government contracting business 
risks of claims and litigation 
unexpected outcomes of pending litigation and governmental proceedings and future unexpected litigation and legal disputes could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
if we experience materially adverse and unexpected outcomes or other unexpected results in our existing litigation and government proceedings  which in turn have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  the accuracy of our forward looking statements would be affected 
similarly  if we experience in the future new  unexpected litigation or adverse results from new  unexpected litigation  there could also be a material adverse effect on our results  again affecting the accuracy of our forward looking statements 
our forward looking statements assume that there will be no materially adverse unexpected outcomes or results that we have not already adequately provided for 
risks of product defects 
our customers often require demanding specifications for product performance and reliability 
because many of our products are complex and often use state of the art components  processes  and techniques  undetected errors and design flaws may occur 
product defects result in higher product service and warranty and replacement costs and may cause damage to our customer relationships and industry reputation  all of which may negatively impact our results of operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will not in the future incur material difficulties with respect to product defects and warranty claims 
risks as to foreign sales and global trade matters 
foreign sales are subject to special risks inherent in doing business outside of the us  including the risk of war  terrorist activities  civil disturbances  embargoes  and government activities  all of which may disrupt markets 
foreign sales are also generally subject to the risk of compliance with additional laws  including tariff regulations and import and export restrictions 
sales in certain foreign countries require prior us government approval in the form of an export license 
we cannot assure you that we will not experience difficulties in connection with future foreign sales 
moreover  changes in global trade policies in our markets could impact our operations in these markets 
recent events concerning the adoption by the us of certain tariffs on foreign imported steel and other products could cause other countries to retaliate and other disruptions in global trade policies 
we have assumed in connection with our forward looking statements that there will be no material changes in global trading policies  such as embargoes  new and large tariffs  or other tax assessments and the like or other new and material restrictions on trade  that apply in particular to our businesses 
risks as to cost controls 
as a manufacturing and service company operating within tight margins and with substantial facilities and inventories and a large workforce  our operations have been  and can be  adversely affected by our inability to control costs and to accurately estimate and plan our costs on an exacting basis 
as a manufacturing and service company it is particularly important for us to estimate and control our costs and expenses  and we continuously endeavor to implement cost identification  estimation  and savings measures in our operations 
our forward looking statements assume that we will be able to contain our costs and expense increases at reasonable levels consistent with expected revenues 
risks as to information technology 
we have recently added  at substantial costs  new information processing systems designed to assist us in cost controls  reporting  and other operations areas 
we anticipate the need to make additional expenditures to increase the efficiency and usefulness of such systems and have not yet enjoyed the full benefits of implementation of such systems 
accordingly  we are at risk as to further costs and implementation problems on our relatively new information technology systems that could adversely affect our results of operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that we will control the costs of such systems in line with our expectations for such systems and that we will implement them satisfactorily 
risks as to acquisitions 
our success is dependent upon the integration of newly acquired businesses with our existing businesses 
our forward looking statements assume the successful integration of acquired businesses and their future contribution to our operations even though integration of acquisitions requires constant effort  including attention to personnel and cost issues  and there can be no assurance as to the ultimate success of our integration efforts 
risks as to currency fluctuations 
a material change in currency exchange rates in our markets could affect our future results as well as affect the carrying values of certain of our assets 
world currencies have been subject to much volatility in recent years 
the us dollar has weakened somewhat against other key currencies the euro and  in recent periods  the japanese yen 
our forward looking statements assume no material impact from future changes in currency exchange rates 
risks as to environmental and safety matters 
our operations and products  and the use thereof  are regulated under a number of federal  state  local  and foreign environmental laws and regulations  which govern  among other things  the discharge of hazardous materials into the air and water as well as the handling  storage  and disposal of hazardous materials 
compliance with these environmental laws is a major consideration in the manufacturing of our products and in their servicing and distribution  as we use and generate hazardous substances and wastes in our manufacturing operations and as we may be subject to material financial liability for any investigation and clean up of such hazardous materials 
in addition  many of our current and former properties are or have been used for industrial purposes 
accordingly  we also may be subject to financial liabilities relating to the investigation and remediation of hazardous materials resulting from the action of previous owners or operators of industrial facilities on those sites 
liability in many instances may be imposed on us regardless of the legality of the original actions relating to hazardous or toxic substances or whether or not we knew of  or were responsible for  the presence of those substances 
we are also subject to various federal  state  local  and foreign laws and regulations relating to safety and health conditions in our manufacturing facilities and with respect to our products and the use thereof and our service operations 
those laws and regulations may also subject us to material financial penalties or liabilities for any noncompliance  as well as potential business disruption if any of our facilities or a portion of any facility is required to be temporarily closed as a result of any violation of those laws and regulations 
any financial liability or business disruption from environmental or health and safety issues could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition and results of operations 
our forward looking statements assume no material adverse impact from environmental and safety issues 
risks as to distributorships 
our power products and distributed energy solutions segments are  in particular  dependent upon a number of distribution agreements with third party manufacturers 
all of our distribution agreements either have expiration dates or are terminable upon certain notifications 
even those with expiration dates are also terminable based on other factors  including changes in our control or in our principal management 
while our principal distribution agreements have been renewed on a regular basis in the past  there can be no assurance that any particular distribution agreement will be renewed in the future or that  on the whole  our principal distribution agreements will continue to be renewed 
the termination of  or a failure to renew  key distribution agreements could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that our principal distribution agreements will not be terminated and or will be renewed as they come up for renewal 
risk as to licenses 
our power products and petroleum equipment segments are dependent upon and subject to certain state motor vehicle licensing requirements 
generally  such licenses are renewed annually 
while these licenses have been renewed on a regular basis in the past  there can be no assurance that any particular license will be renewed in the future 
we are currently in discussions with the motor vehicle division of the texas department of transportation as to issues that have been raised concerning licenses necessary for the sale  distribution  installation and warranty repair of certain large engines and transmissions 
no enforcement action is pending against us in such situation  but our licenses have not been renewed at present pending the resolution of issues that have been raised 
the termination of  or failure to renew  key licenses could have a material adverse impact on our operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that our principal licenses will not be terminated and or will be renewed as they come up for renewal and that we will resolve satisfactorily the texas licensing matters 
credit risks 
we believe that our allowance for bad debts at january   is adequate in light of known circumstances 
however  we cannot give assurance that additional amounts of uncollectible receivables and bad debt write offs will not have a material adverse effect on our future results of operations 
many of our customers have suffered from lower revenues and experienced liquidity challenges resulting from the economic difficulties throughout our industry and the industries we have served in recent periods 
we have in the past incurred write offs in our accounts receivable due to customer credit problems 
we have also found it necessary to extend trade credit and credit enhancements to long term customers and others from time to time where some risks of nonpayment or late payment exist 
substantial unanticipated credit issues can adversely affect our results of operations 
we have assumed in our forward looking statements that our current reserves and allowances will be sufficient to avoid future material impacts on our results of operations
