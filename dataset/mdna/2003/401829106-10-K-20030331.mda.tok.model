item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis  explains the general financial condition and the results of operations for us and our subsidiaries  including where our revenues came from  what our revenues and expenses were in  and  why revenues and expenses changed from the year before  what significant factors affect our business  how all of the foregoing affect our overall financial condition  and what our expenditures for capital projects were in  and and a description of our capital requirements 
as you read this management s discussion and analysis  you may find it helpful to refer to our consolidated financial statements beginning on page f of this annual report 
these consolidated financial statements present the results of our operations for  and as well as our financial position at december  and we analyze and explain the annual changes in the specific line items set forth in our consolidated statements of operations 
this analysis may be important to you in making decisions about your investment in guilford 
results of operations revenue revenues during   and  we recognized revenues of million  million  and million  respectively 
these revenues consisted of the following in millions revenues related to gliadel wafer net product sales license fees and royalties non recurring milestone payments non recurring rights and milestone payments pursuant to implementation of sab revenues from amgen non recurring rights and milestone payments pursuant to implementation of sab research funding under collaborative agreements other total gliadel wafer in june  we entered into a marketing  sales and distribution agreement  together with related agreements with rhone poulenc rorer  predecessor in interest to aventis pharmaceuticals products inc  or aventis 
under these agreements the aventis agreements we granted aventis the worldwide other than scandinavian  and later japanese marketing rights to gliadel wafer  a biodegradable polymer used for the treatment of brain cancer 
at the time that we entered into the aventis agreements  we received million from aventis million as an equity investment and million as a one time non refundable rights payment 
in september  the fda approved gliadel wafer to be marketed for use in connection with surgery for recurrent glioblastoma multiforme  a certain type of primary brain cancer 
from the commercial launch of gliadel wafer in february  until december   we manufactured the product for marketing  sale and distribution by aventis and orion corporation pharma our scandinavian marketing partner for the product 
in exchange we received milestone payments from aventis upon the occurrence of certain events  such as the receipt of marketing approval both in the united states and internationally  and royalties and manufacturing fees in respect of aventis sales 
in october  we reacquired aventis rights in gliadel wafer for  shares of our common stock at an approximate value of million and the assumption of obligations for product returns occurring after december  after a transition period  which ended on december   we began marketing  selling and distributing gliadel wafer ourselves on january  revenues from gliadel wafer net product sales for the years ended december  and  we recognized gliadel wafer net sales of approximately million and million respectively 
during this time  we sold gliadel wafer i directly to hospitals  ii by drop shipment to hospitals pursuant to purchase orders from wholesalers  and iii to specialty distributors 
sales in were higher than sales in  due to sales to our distributors in  as a result of the anticipation that we would receive approval from the fda to expand the label for gliadel wafer to include use at the time of first surgery for malignant glioma 
in march  the fda informed us that the expanded label was not approvable 
consequently  physician demand for the product did not increase  resulting in an imbalance between units in the distribution channel and pull through demand 
because the supply of the product in the distribution channel had increased in excess of demand  we chose  during the second half of to reduce the sale of product to our specialty distributor in order to more closely align the number of units in the distribution channel with demand under the more limited product label for recurrent surgery 
as a result  we made no further shipments to our specialty distributor in the fourth quarter of in response to the fda s decision and concerns  we submitted an amendment to our snda application  which included an additional two years of survival data from the phase iii clinical trial of gliadel wafer 
we agreed with the fda on the protocol and methods for collecting and analyzing this additional long term follow up data 
on september   we presented the results of this analysis to the fda 
after completing an informal review of these data  the fda advised us that the submission of an amendment to the company s snda containing the long term follow up data would receive a formal fda review and reconsideration of the requested new labeling for the product 
on february   the fda notified us that our amended snda was approved  and therefore  we could commence marketing gliadel wafer for use at the time of initial surgery for malignant glioma as an adjunct to surgery and radiation 
for the year ended december   we recognized revenue of million on our sale of gliadel wafer to aventis in accordance with our contractual arrangements  at approximately of the net product sales price established by aventis 
gliadel wafer net sales to customers within the united states were approximately million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the remaining units were sold outside the united states  including europe  canada  south america  israel and australia  either through distributors or direct to hospitals 
approximately million units or and million units or of gliadel wafer treatments sold during the years ended december  and  respectively  were sold to specialty distributors 
during the third quarter of we decided to sell gliadel wafer through specialty distributors in preparation for the expected increase in demand that would have been associated with an expanded label 
at the time of the specialty distributors initial orders in  we provided extended payment terms of up to days 
for the years ended and  one specialty distributor accounted for approximately million and million respectively  of net product sales 
this distributor has nationwide marketing and distribution capabilities that complement our sales and marketing efforts 
additionally  when we make sales to this distributor  they are responsible for shipping the product that they purchase to hospital pharmacies  thereby reducing our overall distribution costs 
without this distributor  we would incur separate shipping costs from our logistical distributor for each shipment of the product to hospital pharmacies and other end users 
this specialty distributor charges discounts on its purchases of gliadel wafer based on its expected sales to end users and the amount of capital it has committed to the product as of the date of its purchases 
we have the ability to accept or reject purchase orders from the specialty distributor at our sole discretion 
for the years ended december  and  our specialty distributors sold  and units  respectively  to hospitals and wholesalers 
it is our general practice to have our sales representatives direct hospital pharmacies to this distributor for purchases of the product  except for purchases under our gliadel advantage program formerly known as the ensured availability program  a special sales and marketing program described below 
we are currently engaged in a dispute with an affiliate of this specialty distributor  which is described in the section below  entitled liquidity and capital resources 
the outcome of this dispute may affect our business relationship with this specialty distributor  which may in turn negatively affect our sales of gliadel wafer 
for additional risks associated with our sale of gliadel wafer to this specialty distributor  see the risk factors discussed above in item a  under the headings a significant portion of our sales are to a specialty pharmaceutical distributor  and our sales to a specialty pharmaceutical distributor depend on its sales to hospital pharmacies and desired level of inventory 
additionally  for the first six months of  we engaged in an enhanced marketing initiative with the specialty distributor that ended on june  of the treatments sold to this specialty distributor during the six month period ended june   units were sold in connection with this marketing initiative 
this marketing initiative included mailing information about gliadel wafer to prospective customers  telemarketing activity and working with our sales representatives to set up customer accounts 
this marketing initiative cost approximately  for the six month period ended june  we did not operate a similar marketing initiative in during the years ended december  and  we sold treatments of gliadel wafer pursuant to our gliadel advantage program  which is designed to increase neurosurgeons awareness of gliadel wafer and to ensure its availability when the neurosurgeon requires it 
under this program  customers are provided day payment terms 
during the years ended december  and  we recognized net revenue of approximately million and million  respectively  under this program 
effective january   we are no longer offering this program 
for the years ended december  and  approximately million  or and million  or of gliadel wafer net sales  respectively  resulted from sales directly to hospitals or drop shipments to hospitals pursuant to purchase orders from wholesalers 
substantially all of these sales to hospitals and wholesalers included our normal payment terms including discounts for early payment 
royalties from gliadel wafer royalties on sales by aventis prior to our reacquisition of the rights to market  sell and distribute gliadel wafer effective january   in addition to recognizing net product sales revenue on our sale of gliadel wafer to aventis  we also recognized royalty revenue based on aventis sales of the product to third parties  such as hospitals 
for the year ended december   royalty revenue on aventis sales of gliadel wafer to third parties was million 
contract revenues as a result of the reacquisition of gliadel wafer from aventis and the termination of our collaboration with amgen  no contract revenues were recognized from these or any other partners during the years ended december  and prior to the reacquisition of gliadel wafer  we received certain non refundable upfront fees and milestone payments from aventis 
we earned non refundable milestone payments from aventis of million during the year ended december  upon receipt of approval to market and sell gliadel wafer in certain countries 
the remaining contract revenue in is the result of our adoption of sab  in the fourth quarter of  effective january  our previous accounting policy was to recognize as revenue certain non refundable upfront fees at the inception of the arrangement 
under sab  collaborative arrangements that include a non refundable upfront fee and contain an element of continuing involvement must be deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of continuing involvement 
for the year ended december   we recognized million of contract revenues upon adoption of sab revenues under collaborative agreements as part of our collaboration with amgen  amgen agreed to fund up to a total of million to support our research relating to the fkbp neuroimmunophilin ligand technology 
the research funding began october  and was payable quarterly over three years 
the last quarterly payment was made on july  cost of sales and gross margin our cost of sales for the years ended december   and  were million  million and million  respectively 
cost of sales includes the cost of materials  labor and overhead 
gross profit percentage net product sales less cost of sales as a percent of net product sales for the years ended december  and was and  respectively 
gross profit percentage for the year ended december  was reduced due to decreased production volumes in compared to  when volumes were increased to support expected higher demand driven by an anticipated first surgery approval for gliadel wafer 
gross profit percentage comparisons to are not meaningful as the company recognized revenue on our sale of gliadel wafer to aventis in accordance with our contractual arrangements  at approximately of the net product sales price established by aventis 
the cost to manufacture gliadel wafer at current market levels can vary materially with production volume 
to the extent that production levels increase or decrease in the future  we anticipate that the unit cost to manufacture gliadel wafer may decrease or increase  respectively 
as a result  we would expect the cost of product sales of gliadel wafer  and accordingly  gross profit percentage  to fluctuate from year to year 
research and development expenses our research and development projects are currently focused on pharmaceutical research and development 
for our biopolymer technologies and our parp inhibitors  we have chosen to pursue potential corporate partnerships or other strategic alternatives in order to further their research and development  rather than develop these projects ourselves 
the following chart sets forth our projects in each of these areas and the stage to which each has been developed development stage status pharmaceutical technologies gpi neuroimmunophilin ligand phase ii active aquavan injection phase ii active naaladase inhibitors pre clinical active other neuroimmunophilin ligands research active other cns projects research active parp inhibitors research inactive biopolymer technologies paclimer microspheres ovarian cancer phase i ii inactive paclimer microspheres lung cancer phase i ii inactive lidocaine pe formerly lidomer microspheres phase i inactive other biopolymer projects research inactive for each of our research and development projects  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials and supplies 
we may also incur third party costs related to these projects  such as contract research  consulting and clinical development costs 
indirect expenses  such as facility and equipment costs  utilities  general research and development management and other administrative overhead are allocated to research and development generally based on  among other things  the extent to which our general research and development efforts make use of facilities  non project personnel and other resources 
our research and development expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
these expenses were divided between our research and development platforms in the following manner years ended december pharmaceutical technologies biopolymer technologies indirect expenses pharmaceutical technologies our pharmaceutical technology research and development expenses decreased in  compared to  primarily due to a decrease in expenses in our naaladase inhibitor program resulting from the completion of our phase i clinical trials of gpi a lead naaladase inhibitor compound 
the decrease in spending on our naaladase inhibitors was partially offset by an increase in spending on our fkbp neuroimmunophilin ligand technology and our aquavan injection program 
for  we expect research and development expenses for our pharmaceutical technologies to be incurred primarily in connection with further clinical development of aquavan injection  the preparation for  and initiation of  one or more phase ii clinical trials of gpi  our lead neuroimmunophilin ligand compound and additional naaladase inhibitor program research 
research and development expenses related to our pharmaceutical and related technologies increased in compared to this increase is the result of advancing aquavan injection and gpi into clinical trials and was offset by a reduction in expenses associated with our neuroimmunophilin program 
biopolymer technologies our biopolymer technology research and development expenses decreased in  compared to  due to a decrease in expenses incurred in connection with the clinical development of both paclimer microspheres and lidocaine pe formerly lidomer microspheres 
the decrease in clinical development expenses resulted from the completion of our clinical trials for paclimer microspheres ovarian cancer and lidocaine pe post surgical pain during the first quarter of in connection with our corporate restructuring in the third quarter of  we terminated the clinical trial for paclimer microspheres lung cancer 
we  therefore  expect research and development expenses related to our biopolymer technology to further decrease during the remainder of  compared to currently  we do not plan to conduct additional research or clinical testing of our biopolymer technologies 
instead  we plan to pursue a corporate partnership  divestiture or similar strategic transaction to further develop these technologies 
with respect to our biopolymer technologies  the modest decrease in compared to reflects less development expenses incurred related to paclimer microspheres offset by an increase in expenses related to lidocaine pe as it advanced into clinic 
indirect expenses our indirect research and development expenses decreased for the year ended compared to  in part due to decreased overhead and a reduction in force in the second half of the increase from the year ended to was caused by increased costs to operate our facilities  as well as increased general research and development management activity 
selling  general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
for the year ended december   the costs incurred to market  sell and distribute gliadel wafer were million compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease in expense is largely attributable to gliadel wafer sales and marketing start up costs incurred in that did not recur in we incurred million in costs associated with the reacquisition and re launch of gliadel wafer during the fourth quarter of prior to the fourth quarter of  we did not have a marketing  sales and distribution function 
during october  the company entered into a three year agreement the cardinal agreement with cardinal health sales and marketing services cardinal to provide guilford with sales representatives for its gliadel wafer product 
included in our costs to market  sell and distribute gliadel wafer is million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  for services provided by cardinal under the cardinal agreement 
on july   we notified cardinal that under the terms of the cardinal agreement  we were exercising our option to transition the contract sales force to us 
as a result  on october  the sales representatives became guilford employees  and pursuant to the terms of the cardinal agreement  we paid cardinal a million transition fee 
costs and expenses associated with our general and administrative functions were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase for the year ended december  to is largely attributable to a restructuring charge of million  which consisted of employee severance costs  including severance pay  related payroll taxes and insurance and outplacement services 
the increase from to was attributable to the expansion of our overall corporate development activities as well as overall general and administrative spend 
our general and administrative functions include the areas of executive management  finance and administration  investor and public relations  corporate development  human resources and legal 
additionally  we include the costs to prepare  file and prosecute domestic and international patent applications and for other activities to establish and preserve our intellectual property rights in our general and administrative expenses 
for each function  we may incur direct expenses such as salaries  supplies and third party consulting and other external costs 
indirect costs such as facilities  utilities and other administrative overhead are also allocated to selling  general and administrative expenses 
merger costs on august   we terminated the agreement and plan of merger previously entered into on may  with gliatech  inc we incurred costs related to this proposed merger transaction of million for the year ended december  other income and expense other income and expense consists primarily of income on our investments and interest expense on our debt and other financial obligations 
our investment income was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in investment income in compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates and investment balances maintained during those periods 
the decrease in investment income in compared to was primarily due to lower interest rates in on modestly larger average investment balances maintained during that year 
we incurred interest expense of million for each of the years ended december   and these expenses resulted primarily from i loans from a commercial bank that helped fund the construction of our manufacturing  administrative  and research and development facilities and the purchase of certain furniture and equipment  ii capital leases entered into for the purchase of computer equipment  and iii a note payable to a commercial bank primarily used to repay a million note payable to cardinal pursuant to the cardinal agreement 
cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle we recorded a non cash charge to earnings of million as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the implementation of sab our previous accounting policy was to recognize as revenue certain non refundable upfront fees at the inception of a collaborative arrangement 
under sab  non refundable upfront fee arrangements that contain an element of continuing involvement must be deferred and recognized as revenue over the period of involvement 
as of december   the company has recognized as revenue the full amount of non refundable upfront fee payments subject to deferral under sab liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through the issuance of equity securities  revenues from the sales of gliadel wafer  funding pursuant to collaborative agreements and proceeds from loans or other borrowings 
for the year ended  cash  cash equivalents and investments were reduced by million to primarily fund net operating activities 
our cash  cash equivalents and investments were million at december  of this amount  we pledged million as collateral for certain of our loans and other financial lease obligations 
in addition to these restricted investments  we are required to maintain  in the aggregate  unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  and investments of million at all times under the terms of certain of our financial obligations 
in total  our banking covenants require us to maintain approximately million in restricted and unrestricted investments pursuant to these financial obligations 
we believe we will be able to stay in compliance with our covenants and restrictions for the year ended december   by either maintaining the necessary cash requirements or restructuring the covenants and restrictions 
we are currently examining opportunities to reduce these collateral and liquidity requirements  however  there can be no assurances that we will be successful in our attempts to modify these obligations 
our total long term debt decreased a net million to million at december   compared to million at december  this decrease is primarily due to repayments of million offset by borrowings of million from a commercial bank combined with additional financings in the amount of million for insurance and capital leases 
on may   the company borrowed million from a commercial bank  in order to repay the note payable to cardinal 
this new indebtedness bears interest at the rate of one month libor plus and is payable in four equal annual installments of principal beginning april   with the final payment due on april  interest payments are due quarterly 
in connection with this indebtedness  we are required to maintain with the commercial bank  restricted cash  cash equivalents and investments in the amount of the unpaid principal balance of this indebtedness 
the company funds capital additions through either lease arrangements or direct purchases utilizing our existing cash 
to the extent possible  we finance property and equipment requirements by obtaining capital and operating leases 
we funded capital expenditures of million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
of the capital expenditures funded during the year ended december   million were funded pursuant to capital equipment lease arrangements  million through operating leases  and million were acquired through the use of our cash 
in connection with this indebtedness  we are required to maintain restricted cash  cash equivalents and investments in the amount of million 
in october  the company entered into a new master lease agreement to provide up to million for computer and equipment financing 
the company s previous master lease agreement  entered into in august expired on june the term of each operating lease varies from to months based upon the type of equipment being leased 
as of december   the company had leased approximately million in equipment under this master lease agreement 
in february  we entered into a real estate development agreement and operating lease with a special purpose entity sponsored by a commercial bank  to design  construct and lease a research and development facility 
the entity is not consolidated in our consolidated financial statements and we have accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended 
none of our officers or directors are affiliated with this special purpose entity 
this facility  which was substantially completed in june for a total cost of approximately million  was constructed adjacent to our current headquarters in baltimore  maryland and provides approximately  square feet of research and development capacity 
the initial lease term is for a period of months including the construction period and expires in february we have the option to either purchase the facility on the remaining anniversary dates during the initial lease term  or sell the facility to a third party at the expiration of the initial lease term 
in the event the facility is sold to a third party  we will be obligated to pay the lessor any shortfall between the sales price and of the lessor s net investment in the facility 
the lessor s net investment in the facility was approximately million at december  and we anticipate that it will be further reduced to approximately million by the expiration of the initial lease term in february the company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of the spe is the residual guarantee million 
we are required to maintain collateral equal to approximately after certain guarantees of the remaining balance of the lessor s net investment in the facility 
we were required to maintain cash collateral of million as of december   which is included in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets as investments restricted 
in addition to this cash collateral requirement  we are subject to various other affirmative and negative covenants  the most restrictive of which requires us to maintain unrestricted cash  cash equivalents  and investments in the aggregate equal to million relative to this agreement 
pursuant to the terms of the operating lease agreement  we are obligated to make monthly lease payments equal to the interest  based on monthly libor plus  calculated on the lessor s net investment in the facility plus principal of  as a result of the interest rate swap agreements entered into during and with a commercial bank  we effectively fixed the interest rates on these variable interest rate based lease payments at approximately in the aggregate 
these interest rate swap agreements provide the commercial bank with a call provision exercisable during assuming the commercial bank exercises its call provision  we would be exposed to market risk related to the underlying interest rates of the operating lease 
in addition to the interest rate swap agreements covering the underlying debt for our research and development facility  we entered into a series of interest rate swap transactions in and  with a commercial bank covering at that time million of our bond and term loans 
as a result  we fixed the interest rates on our debt at approximately in the aggregate 
the notional amounts of these interest rate swap agreements amortize at the same rate as the underlying bond and term loans 
during  the company terminated its agreement with cardinal to provide a contract sales force 
the termination has led to a dispute regarding amounts owed to cardinal at the termination date 
the company does not believe it has any remaining obligations to cardinal at december  relative to the agreement  however  cardinal has asserted that it may be owed million 
on march   we received notice from the parent of cardinal that national speciality services inc nss  an affiliate of cardinal and a subsidiary of its parent  was going to offset the amount cardinal claims we owe it against an account payable in the amount of approximately million that nss owes us  in addition to taking certain unearned prompt payment discounts  also in payment of the amounts that cardinal claims we owe it 
nss is the specialty distributor to whom we sell gliadel wafer 
we do not believe that cardinal or nss has the right to make an offset under our agreement with nss for amounts that cardinal claims we owe it 
the company does not believe the resolution of this matter will have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial condition  result of operations or liquidity 
we have an agreement with the specialty distributor to whom we sell gliadel wafer that permits either us or the specialty distributor to terminate the agreement upon days prior written notice 
under the terms of our agreement with this distributor  if the agreement is terminated  we have an obligation to repurchase any remaining treatments of gliadel wafer that the distributor may have in its inventory 
as of december   we believe that our specialty distributor had approximately million of gliadel wafer in its inventory 
we expect to need significantly greater capital to continue our research and development programs and pre clinical and clinical testing and to manufacture and market  sell and distribute our products 
our future capital requirements will depend on many factors  including but not limited to  revenues from the sale of gliadel wafer  progress of our research and development programs  progress of pre clinical and clinical testing  time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approval  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  changes in our existing research relationships  competing technological and marketing developments  ability to establish collaborative arrangements  ability to enter into licensing agreements and contractual arrangements with others  and the cost of product in licensing 
as a result  we may need significant additional funding in the future 
the source  timing and availability of this funding will depend on market conditions  interest rates and other factors 
this funding may be sought through various sources  including debt and equity offerings  corporate collaborations  bank borrowings  lease arrangements relating to fixed assets or other financing methods 
there can be no assurances that additional funds will be available on favorable terms  if at all 
we believe that our existing resources will be sufficient to fund our activities through at least december  however  we may need significantly greater capital in the near future to increase pre clinical and clinical development activities for product candidates  such as gpi our lead neuroimmunophilin ligand  aquavan injection  naaladase inhibitors  other neuroimmunophilin ligands  and other research projects additionally  in order to leverage the capabilities of our commercial operations group  we are investigating the possibility of in licensing additional hospital based products in our targeted markets 
in order to acquire one or more of these products  we may require significant additional capital 
the following are contractual commitments at december   associated with debt obligations  lease obligations and our research and development projects in thousands payments due by period contractual commitments total years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases research and development facility lease research and development arrangements total contractual commitments this table does not include any milestone payments under agreements we have entered into in relation to our in licensed technology  as the timing and likelihood of such payments are not known 
also  minimum annual research expenditures pursuant to such license agreements have been excluded from this table as we expect to spend those amounts as we progress the development of the underlying technologies 
in the aggregate these minimum annual research expenditures are approximately million and typically apply to all years prior to regulatory approval of a product incorporating the licensed technology 
in february  we entered into a real estate development agreement and operating lease with a special purpose entity sponsored by a commercial bank which we will refer to as lessor in this note to acquire  construct and lease a research and development facility 
construction was completed in at a total cost of approximately million 
we account for this lease as an operating lease and  as a result  record neither an asset nor a liability on our balance sheet 
the amounts included in the table above include only our annual lease payments of approximately million for the remainder of the initial lease term ending february our lease payments represent variable rate interest payments indexed to the london interbank offered rate  also known as libor on the lessor s net investment in the facility plus principal of  per month 
as a result of certain interest rate swap agreements entered into by us  we have effectively fixed the interest rate on this variable interest rate based lease at approximately 
at the expiration of the initial lease term  we may either purchase the facility or sell the facility to a third party 
the lease provides a residual value guarantee from us to the lessor in the event the facility is sold to a third party for less than of the lessor s investment in the facility 
we do not believe that our facility has experienced a property value decline below the residual value guarantee 
however  we have no assurance that the property value will not decline between now and the termination of the initial lease on or before february research and development arrangements include commitments that we have entered into at december   to engage third parties to perform various aspects of our research and development efforts subsequent to december  critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ from our estimates and assumptions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect our more significant estimates and assumptions and require the use of complex judgment in their application 
revenue recognition 
revenue from sales of gliadel wafer  our only marketed product  is recognized when  pursuant to staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements  all four of the following criteria are met i we have persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii the price is fixed and determinable  iii title has passed and iv collection is reasonably assured 
our primary customer is national specialty services  inc or nss  a large specialty pharmaceutical distributor who sells directly into the retail channel 
product demand by this distributor during a given period may not correlate with prescription demand for the product in that period 
as a result  we periodically evaluate nss inventory position 
if we believe these levels are too high based on prescription demand  we will not accept purchase orders from or ship additional product to nss until these levels are reduced 
provisions for sales discounts  and estimates for chargebacks  rebates  damaged product returns  and exchanges for expired product are established as a reduction of product sales revenues at the time such revenues are recognized 
these revenue reductions are established by us as our best estimate at the time of sale based on historical experience  adjusted to reflect known changes in the factors that impact such reserves 
research and development expenses 
for each of our research and development projects  we incur both direct and indirect expenses 
direct expenses include salaries and other costs of personnel  raw materials and supplies 
we may also incur third party costs related to these projects  such as contract research  consulting and clinical development costs 
indirect expenses  such as facility and equipment costs  utilities  general research and development management and other administrative overhead are allocated to research and development generally based on  among other things  the extent to which our general research and development efforts make use of facilities  non project personnel and other resources 
we review and accrue clinical trials expenses based on estimates of work performed and completion of certain events 
we believe that this method best aligns the expenses we record with the efforts we expend 
accrued clinical costs are subject to revisions as trials progress to completion 
revisions are charged to expense in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
special purpose entity 
in february  we entered into a real estate development agreement and operating lease with a special purpose entity sponsored by a commercial bank  to design  construct and lease a research and development facility 
the entity is not consolidated in our consolidated financial statements and we have accounted for this arrangement as an operating lease in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for leases  as amended 
none of our officers or directors is affiliated with this special purpose entity 
this facility  which was substantially completed in june for a total cost of approximately million  was constructed adjacent to our current headquarters in baltimore  maryland and provides approximately  square feet of research and development capacity 
the initial lease term is for a period of months including the construction period and expires in february we have the option to either purchase the facility on the remaining anniversary dates during the initial lease term  or sell the facility to a third party at the expiration of the initial lease term 
in the event the facility is sold to a third party  we will be obligated to pay the lessor any shortfall between the sales price and of the lessor s net investment in the facility 
the lessor s net investment in the facility was approximately million at december  and we anticipate that it will be further reduced to approximately million by the expiration of the initial lease term in february we do not believe that our facility has experienced a property value decline below the residual value guarantee 
however  we have no assurance that the property value will not decline between now and the termination of the initial lease on or before february the company s maximum exposure to loss as a result of the spe is the residual guarantee million 
new accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others the interpretation 
the interpretation will significantly change current practice in the accounting for  and disclosure of  guarantees 
the interpretation requires certain guarantees to be recorded at fair value as those terms are defined in sfas  accounting for contingencies 
the company does not expect the adoption of the interpretation to have a significant financial impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas which amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and requires more prominent and more frequent disclosures in the financial statements of the effects of stock based compensation 
the provisions of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  and the interim disclosure provisions are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the company will provide the required interim disclosures beginning in the quarter ended march  the company has elected to continue accounting for stock options in accordance with apb as such  no compensation expense for stock options has been recognized under the fair value basis of accounting on the consolidated statements of operations 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities with the objective of improving financial reporting by companies involved with variable interest entities 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights  or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
historically  entities generally were not consolidated unless the entity was controlled through voting interests 
fin changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a company that consolidates a variable interest entity is called the primary beneficiary of that entity 
fin also requires disclosures about variable interest entities that a company is not required to consolidate but in which it has a significant variable interest 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements of fin apply to existing entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  also  certain disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the company is in the process of assessing the impact of fin on the company and specifically as it relates to the operating lease for its research and development facility with a special purpose entity spe sponsored by a commercial bank 
if it is determined to apply  the application of fin may result in the company consolidating the spe for the quarter ended september  in the company s consolidated financial statements  or alternatively  it may result in the company exploring alternatives such as selling or restructuring its interest in the facility 
see note of our consolidated financial statements for the pro forma impact of consolidating the spe on certain categories of our consolidated balance sheet at december   and on our net loss for the year ended december  outlook for the year ending december   we expect sales of gliadel wafer to be between million and million  with a point estimate of million 
additionally  we are actively looking to acquire another product to market and sell 
although this is a competitive market  we remain committed to finding an acceptable opportunity through in licensing  co promotion  or other potential avenues 
we anticipate that cost of goods sold  as a percentage of net sales  will decrease as our production volume increases 
for  we estimate cost of goods sold as a percentage of net sales will be between and 
we expect research and development expenditures in to be approximately million to million 
we anticipate that selling  general and administrative costs will remain constant in  reflecting normal adjustments for recurring salary  benefits and similar costs 
accordingly  we would expect selling  general and administrative expenditures to be in the range of to million 
our current budgets and plans include cash proceeds from potential corporate collaborations and or strategic financings of approximately million to million 
if we can achieve these objectives  we will expect to have cash at the end of of not less than approximately to million 
to increase cash flow  we also continue to focus on out licensing or selling product candidates or technologies we do not intend to pursue the development of ourselves 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk a substantial portion of our assets are investment grade debt instruments such as direct obligations of the us treasury  securities of federal agencies which carry the direct or implied guarantee of the us government  bank certificates of deposit and corporate securities  including commercial paper and corporate debt instruments 
the market value of such investments fluctuates with current market interest rates 
in general  as rates increase  the market value of a debt instrument would be expected to decrease 
the opposite is also true 
to minimize such market risk  we have in the past and  to the extent possible  will continue in the future to hold such debt instruments to maturity at which time the debt instrument will be redeemed at its stated or face value 
due to the short duration and nature of these instruments  we do not believe that we have a material exposure to interest rate risk related to our investment portfolio 
the investment portfolio at december  was million and yield to maturity was approximately 
the weighted average return on our investments during the year ended december  was approximately 
substantially all of our financial obligations were established with interest rates  which fluctuate with market conditions 
as a hedge against such fluctuations in interest rates  we have entered into certain interest rate swap agreements with a commercial bank counter party  to exchange substantially all of our variable rates of interest on certain financial obligations for fixed rates 
our borrowings under our bond and term loans and financial obligations under certain lease arrangements are approximately million 
pursuant to these borrowing arrangements  we are obligated to pay variable interest rates on substantially all of these obligations of libor plus between and 
the interest rate swap agreements have a total notional principal amount of approximately million as of december  pursuant to these interest rate swap agreements  we pay a fixed rate of interest to the counter party of approximately and receive from the counter party a variable rate of interest of libor plus 
the differential to be paid or received as interest rates change is charged or credited  as appropriate  to operations 
accordingly  we have effectively swapped or exchanged floating interest rates for fixed interest rates on our financial obligations at a blended annual rate of approximately in the aggregate 
these interest rate swap agreements have approximately the same maturity dates as the financial obligations and expire on various dates through february the commercial bank has the right to terminate certain of the agreements having a total notional principal amount of million during february we do not speculate on the future direction of interest rates nor do we use these derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
in the event of non performance by the counter party  we could be exposed to market risk related to interest rates 
the aggregate fair value of these interest rate swap agreements was a liability of approximately million at december  current market pricing models were used to estimate these fair values
