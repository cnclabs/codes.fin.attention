item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our financial statements and related notes 
this discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations also contains descriptions of our expectations regarding future trends affecting our business 
these forward looking statements and other forward looking statements made elsewhere in this report are made in reliance upon safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of several factors  including  but not limited to those factors set forth and discussed under factors that may affect future results and elsewhere in this report  which include without limitation the fact that our operating results fluctuate significantly  that our business is dependent on the storage area network market that is new and unpredictable  and that our financial condition will be adversely impacted if we do not maintain and gain market or industry acceptance of our products 
readers of this annual report on form k are urged to read those sections in their entirety 
in light of the significant uncertainties inherent in the forward looking information included in this document  the inclusion of this information should not be regarded as a representation by us or any other person that our objectives or plans will be achieved 
we undertake no obligation to update or revise these forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
results of operations the following table sets forth the results of operations and percentage of net revenues in our consolidated statements of income fiscal year ended march  march  april  dollars in millions net revenues cost of revenues gross profit operating expenses engineering and development selling and marketing general and administrative merger and related expenses total operating expenses operating income interest and other income income before income taxes income taxes net income net revenues our net revenues are derived primarily from the sale of scsi and fibre channel based products 
we also license certain designs and receive royalty revenues and non recurring engineering fees 
net revenues in fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase was the result of a million increase in sales of fibre channel products and a million increase in sales of scsi products  partially offset by a million decrease in ide based royalties which had ceased during fiscal 
table of contents net revenues in fiscal of million decreased million  or  from fiscal the decrease was the result of a million decrease in sales of scsi products and a million decrease in ide based royalties  partially offset by a million increase in sales of fibre channel products 
export revenues primarily to pacific rim countries in fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal  primarily due to increased sales to our peripheral chip customers in japan 
export revenues in fiscal of million decreased million  or  from fiscal  primarily due to a decline in sales to customers in japan 
as a percentage of net revenues  export revenues accounted for in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal export revenues are denominated in us dollars 
a small number of our customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
our three largest customers accounted for of net revenues in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal these significant customers included i fujitsu  which accounted for  and of net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  ii sun microsystems  which accounted for  and of net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively  and iii hitachi  which accounted for  and of net revenues in fiscal  and we believe that our major customers continually evaluate whether or not to purchase products from alternate or additional sources 
additionally  customers economic and market conditions frequently change 
accordingly  there can also be no assurance that a major customer will not reduce  delay or eliminate its purchases from us 
any such reduction  delay or loss of purchases could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
gross profit gross profit represents net revenues less cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of raw materials including silicon chips from third party manufacturers  assembly and test labor  overhead and warranty costs 
the gross profit percentage in fiscal was  an increase from in fiscal the increase in gross profit percentage was due primarily to increased sales of higher margin fibre channel based products  as well as manufacturing efficiencies realized from the increase in production 
the gross profit percentage in fiscal was  a decrease from in fiscal the decline in the gross profit percentage in fiscal was due to a reduction in the contribution of license fees and a decrease in margins on sales of earlier generation scsi products 
our ability to maintain our current gross profit percentage can be significantly affected by factors such as supply costs and  in particular  the cost of silicon chips  the worldwide semiconductor foundry capacity  the mix of products shipped  competitive price pressures  the timeliness of volume shipments of new products  the level of royalties received and our ability to achieve manufacturing cost reductions 
we anticipate that it will be increasingly more difficult to reduce manufacturing costs 
also  royalty revenues have been irregular or unpredictable 
as a result of these and other factors  it may be difficult to maintain our gross profit percentage consistent with historical trends and it may decline in the future 
operating expenses engineering and development 
engineering and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related costs  development related material  occupancy costs and related computer support costs 
engineering and development expenses in fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in engineering and development expenses for fiscal primarily reflects an increase in our headcount and personnel related costs associated with our expanded development efforts in support of existing and future technologies and the accelerated launch of new products 
we believe continued investments in engineering and development activities are critical to achieving our strategic objectives 
as a result  we expect that the dollar amount of engineering and development expenses will continue to increase in the future 

table of contents engineering and development expenses in fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in engineering and development expenses in fiscal was largely due to increased personnel and related costs in support of the design and engineering of fibre channel and scsi products 
selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses consist primarily of sales and marketing salaries  sales commissions and related expenses  promotional activities and travel for sales and marketing personnel 
selling and marketing expenses in fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in selling and marketing expenses for fiscal primarily reflects an increase in sales commissions earned by independent sales representatives as a result of the significant increase in our net revenues  an increase in the headcount and related personnel costs associated with the expansion of our sales and marketing groups  and an increase in the costs associated with promotional and marketing related programs 
we believe continued investments in our selling and marketing organizational infrastructure and related marketing programs are critical to the success of our strategy of expanding our customer base and enhancing relationships with our existing customers 
as a result  we expect sales and marketing expenses will continue to increase in the future 
selling and marketing expenses in fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in selling and marketing expenses in fiscal primarily reflects an increase in personnel related costs to more completely serve our customers 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and personnel related costs for executive  finance  accounting  human resources  legal and information technology personnel 
non personnel related costs consist of recruiting fees  professional services and corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal of million decreased million  or  from fiscal the decrease in general and administrative expenses for fiscal resulted principally from a reduction in amortization expense associated with certain intangible assets and a lower provision for uncollectible accounts receivable  partially offset by increases in headcount and personnel related expenses 
the reduction in the amortization expense in fiscal includes million associated with certain intangible assets that were fully amortized in fiscal  and the elimination of million of goodwill amortization in connection with our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets as of april  the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable of million for fiscal resulted from accounts receivable collections more favorable than previously estimated  in fiscal the provision for uncollectible accounts receivable was million 
excluding the effect of the reduction of the amortization expense and the provision for uncollectible accounts  our general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million 
in connection with the growth of our business  we would expect general and administrative expenses to increase in the future 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal of million increased million  or  from fiscal the increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily due to increased depreciation costs related to improved business systems and insurance costs 
merger and related expenses 
merger and related expenses in fiscal consisted primarily of direct and incremental transaction costs  such as fees for investment bankers  attorneys  accountants  and other related fees and expenses 
merger and related costs of approximately million were incurred in connection with the merger with ancor communications  incorporated 
non operating income interest and other income for fiscal of million is comprised principally of interest income and investment gains related to our portfolio of marketable securities  partially offset by write downs of non marketable investments 
the million decline in interest and other income in fiscal from the prior year was due to a million write down of non marketable investments and declining interest rates on our portfolio of marketable securities  partially offset by increased earnings on investments associated with larger investment balances and realized gains on sales of marketable securities 
during fiscal  the carrying values of certain non marketable investments were written down to their estimated fair value of zero 
these 
table of contents investments consisted of equity interests in early stage technology companies which we had accounted for under the cost method 
we estimated the fair value of these investments based on available financial and other information  including the then current and projected business prospects for the subject companies  and determined that the decline in the fair value of these investments was other than temporary 
interest and other income for fiscal of million increased from million primarily due to larger investment balances  partially offset by lower interest rates 
income taxes our effective tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the increase in the tax rate in fiscal from the prior year was due primarily to an increase in income before income taxes  without a corresponding increase in tax benefits associated with research activities and export sales 
the elevated tax rate in fiscal was due to nondeductible costs incurred in conjunction with the merger with ancor communications  incorporated 
we expect our effective income tax rate will continue to increase during fiscal liquidity and capital resources our combined balances of cash and cash equivalents and short term investments have increased to million at march  compared to million at march  the increase was attributable to positive cash flow from operations  primarily net income  during the fiscal our primary sources of liquidity are our existing cash and cash equivalent balances  available for sale marketable securities  and cash expected to be generated from operations 
during fiscal  our working capital increased million to million at march  the increase in working capital during fiscal was principally attributable to our cash flow from operations 
cash provided by operating activities was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal fiscal operating cash flows reflect our net income of million  million of non cash charges depreciation and amortization  deferred income taxes and other  and a net decrease in the non cash components of our working capital of million 
the fiscal changes in non cash components of working capital include a million increase in income taxes payable  an million increase in accrued compensation and other liabilities  and a million decrease in inventories due to an improvement in our inventory turnover during fiscal these working capital changes were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable resulting from the increase in sales and a million increase in prepaid expenses and other assets 
cash used in investing activities of million for fiscal includes net purchases of marketable securities of million and additions to property and equipment of million 
in fiscal  cash used in investing activities of million principally consisted of net purchases of marketable securities of million and additions to property and equipment of million 
cash provided by financing activities of million for fiscal consisted of million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock under our stock plans  partially offset by our purchase of million of treasury stock 
in fiscal  cash provided by financing activities of million resulted from the proceeds from the issuance of common stock under stock plans 
we have certain obligations and commitments to make future payments in the form of non cancelable purchase orders to our suppliers and commitments under operating lease arrangements 
at march   we had non cancelable purchase orders of approximately million  which are all due within one year 
future commitments under operating leases as of march  totaled million  which included million due in fiscal  million due in fiscal  and an aggregate of million due in fiscal years we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances  short term investments and cash flows from operating activities will provide sufficient funds to finance our operations for at least the next months 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on several other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  and which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting policies to be both those most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and those that require the most subjective judgment revenue recognition  and inventory valuation 
revenue recognition 
we sell our products domestically and internationally primarily through oem and distribution channel customers including distributors  system integrators and value added resellers 
our significant customers include leading storage solution providers  server oems and storage oems 
we recognize revenue from product sales when goods are shipped and title and risk of loss transfers to the customer 
for all sales  we use a binding purchase order or a signed agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
the customer s obligation to pay and the payment terms are set at the time of shipment and are not dependent on subsequent resale of the our products 
however  certain of our sales are made to distributors under agreements allowing for a limited right to return unsold product 
we recognize revenue from these distributors when the product is sold by the distributor to a third party 
royalty and service revenue is recognized when earned and receipt is assured 
inventory valuation 
inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
we use a standard cost system for purposes of determining cost 
the standards are adjusted periodically to ensure they approximate actual costs 
we write down the carrying value of our inventory to market value for estimated obsolete or excess inventory based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we compare current inventory levels on a product basis to our current sales forecasts in order to assess our inventory balance 
our sales forecasts are based on economic conditions and trends both current and projected  anticipated customer demand and acceptance of our current products  expected future products and other assumptions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional write downs may be required 
recent accounting standards in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the consensus mandates how goods or services  or both  that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for 
eitf is effective for transactions entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not believe the adoption of eitf will have a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
factors that may affect future results certain information in this report includes forward looking statements 
forward looking statements include statements regarding our expectations  beliefs  intentions  plans  objectives  goals  strategies  future events or performance and underlying assumptions and other statements that are other than statements of historical fact 
when used in this report the words shall  should  forecast  all of  projected  believes  anticipates  expects  and similar expressions are intended to identify these forward looking statements 
in addition  we may from time to time make oral forward looking statements 
we wish to caution readers that a number of important factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those in the forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed 
table of contents below  as well as those discussed above in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  elsewhere in this report or from time to time described in our other filings with the securities and exchange commission 
our stock price may be volatile which could affect the value of your investment 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially  and there can be no assurance that such volatility will not continue 
from january  through may   the market price has ranged from a low of per share to a high of per share 
several factors could impact our stock price including  but not limited to announcements concerning us  our competitors or our customers  quarterly fluctuations in our operating results  introduction of new products or changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  conditions in the semiconductor industry  changes in market projections by industry forecasters  changes in estimates of our earnings by industry analysts  overall market conditions for high technology equities  rumors or dissemination of false information  and general economic conditions  including terrorist activities or military actions 
in addition  stock markets have experienced extreme price and volume volatility in recent years and stock prices of technology companies have been especially volatile 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad market fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our operating results fluctuate significantly  which could cause our stock price to decline if our results fail to meet investors and analysts expectations 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  fluctuations in sales and operating results from quarter to quarter 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful  and that such comparisons cannot be relied upon as indicators of future performance 
in addition  there can be no assurance that we will maintain our current profitability or gross margins in the future 
a significant portion of our net revenues in each fiscal quarter result from orders booked in that quarter 
orders placed by major customers are typically based on their forecasted sales and inventory levels for our products 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may be the result of changes in purchasing patterns by one or more of our major customers  order changes or rescheduling  gain or loss of significant customers  customer policies pertaining to desired inventory levels of our products  negotiations of rebates and extended payment terms  changes in our ability to anticipate in advance the mix of customer orders  level of inventory our customers require us to maintain in our field warehouses  developing higher performance application specific integrated circuits  or asics  that create chip level solutions that replace selected board level solutions at significantly lower average selling prices  the time  availability and sale of new products  
table of contents changes in the mix and or average selling prices of our products  variations in manufacturing capacities  efficiencies and costs  the availability and cost of components  including silicon chips  warranty expenses  variations in product development and other operating expenses  adjustments related to product returns  adoption of new accounting pronouncements or changes in our policies  general economic and other conditions affecting the timing of customer orders and capital spending  or a downturn in the global economy that impacts information technology spending 
our quarterly results of operations are also influenced by competitive factors  including the pricing and availability of our products and our competitors products 
although we do not maintain our own silicon chip manufacturing facility  portions of our expenses are fixed and difficult to reduce in a short period of time 
if net revenues do not meet our expectations  our fixed expenses would magnify the effect on gross profit and net income of such shortfall in net revenues 
furthermore  announcements regarding new products and technologies could cause our customers to defer or cancel purchases of our products 
order deferrals by our customers  delays in our introduction of new products  and longer than anticipated design in cycles for our products have in the past adversely affected our quarterly results of operations 
due to these factors  as well as other unanticipated factors  it is likely that in some future quarter or quarters our operating results will be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  and as a result  the price of our common stock could significantly decrease 
our business is dependent on the storage area network san market that is relatively new and unpredictable  and if this market does not develop and expand as we anticipate  our business will suffer 
a significant number of our products are used in sans and  therefore  our business is dependent on the san market 
accordingly  the widespread adoption of sans for use in organizations computing systems is critical to our future success 
most of the organizations that potentially may purchase our products from our customers have invested substantial resources in their existing computing and data storage systems and  as a result  may be reluctant or slow to adopt a new approach like sans 
sans are often implemented in connection with the deployment of new storage systems and servers 
therefore  our future success is also substantially dependent on the market for new storage systems and servers 
furthermore  the ability of the different components used in a san to function effectively  or interoperate  with each other when placed in a computing system has not yet been achieved on a widespread basis 
until greater interoperability is achieved  customers may be reluctant to deploy sans 
our success in generating revenue in the emerging san market will depend on  among other things  our ability to educate potential oem customers  distributors  resellers  system integrators  storage service providers and end user organizations about the benefits of sans  maintain and enhance our relationships with oem customers  distributors  resellers  system integrators and storage system providers  predict and base our products on standards which ultimately become industry standards  and achieve interoperability between our products and other san components from diverse vendors 

table of contents our financial condition will be materially harmed if we do not maintain and gain market or industry acceptance of our products 
the markets in which we compete involve rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards and continuing improvements in products and services 
our future success depends  in part  on our ability to enhance our current products and develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that keep pace with technological developments and industry standards  compete effectively on the basis of price and performance  and adequately address oem customer and end user customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we believe that to remain competitive in the future  we will need to continue to develop new products  which will require a significant investment in new product development 
a significant portion of our revenues is generated from fibre channel technology 
our competitors are developing alternative technologies that may compete with the market acceptance of our fibre channel products  such as iscsi  infiniband  serial attached scsi sas and serial advanced technology attachment sata 
if alternative standards are adopted by the industry  we may not be able to develop products for new standards in a timely manner 
further  even if alternative technologies do augment fibre channel revenues  our products may not be fully developed in time to be accepted by our customers 
even if our new products are developed on time  we may not be able to manufacture them at competitive prices in sufficient volumes 
we depend on a limited number of customers  and any decrease in revenue or cash flows from any one of our customers could adversely affect our results of operations and cause our stock price to decline 
a small number of customers account for a substantial portion of our net revenues  and we expect that a limited number of customers will continue to represent a substantial portion of our net revenues in the foreseeable future 
during fiscal  we had three customers who each accounted for more than of our net revenues and aggregated of our total net revenues 
additionally  we are also subject to credit risk associated with the concentration of our accounts receivable 
the loss of any of our major customers would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
this risk is increased due to the potential for some of these customers to exit the markets served by us  or to merge with one of our competitors 
additionally  some of these customers are based in the pacific rim region  which is subject to economic and political uncertainties 
our customers generally order products through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts and  therefore  such customers are generally not obligated to purchase products from us for any extended period 
major customers also have significant leverage over us and may attempt to change the terms  including pricing  which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
this risk is increased due to the potential for some of these customers to merge with or acquire one or more of our other customers 
as our oem customers are pressured to reduce prices as a result of competitive factors  we may be required to contractually commit to price reductions for our products before we know how  or if  cost reductions can be obtained 
if we are unable to achieve such cost reductions  our gross margins could decline and such decline could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
competition within our product markets is intense and includes numerous established competitors 
the markets for our products are highly competitive and are characterized by short product life cycles  price erosion  rapidly changing technology  frequent product performance improvements and evolving industry standards 
we currently compete primarily with adaptec  inc and lsi logic corporation in the scsi sector of the input output  or i o  market 
in the fibre channel host bus adapter sector of the i o market  we compete primarily with emulex corporation  lsi logic corporation and jni corporation 
in the fibre channel host controller chip sector of the market  we compete primarily with agilent technologies  inc and lsi logic corporation 
in the switch products sector  we compete primarily with brocade communications 
table of contents systems  inc  cisco systems  inc 
and mcdata corporation 
in the enclosure management sector  we compete primarily with vitesse semiconductor corporation 
we may compete with some of our larger disk drive and computer systems customers  some of which have the capability to develop integrated circuits for use in their own products 
at least one large oem customer in the past has decided to vertically integrate and has therefore stopped purchasing from us 
we will need to continue to develop products appropriate to our markets to remain competitive as our competitors continue to introduce products with improved performance characteristics 
while we continue to devote significant resources to research and development  these efforts may not be successful  or may not be developed and introduced in a timely manner 
further  several of our competitors have greater resources devoted to securing semiconductor foundry capacity because of long term agreements regarding supply flow  equity or financing agreements or direct ownership of a foundry 
in addition  while relatively few competitors offer a full range of san products  additional domestic and foreign manufacturers may increase their presence in these markets 
we may not be able to compete successfully against these or other competitors 
if we are unable to design  develop and introduce competitive new products on a timely basis  our future operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
our distributors may not adequately distribute our products and their reseller customers may purchase products from our competitors  which could negatively affect our operations 
our distributors generally offer a diverse array of products from several different manufacturers and suppliers 
accordingly  we are at risk that these distributors may give higher priority to selling products from other suppliers  thus reducing their efforts to sell our products 
a reduction in sales efforts by our current distributors could materially adversely impact our business or operating results 
in addition  if we decrease our distributor incentive programs  our distributors may temporarily decrease the amounts of product purchased from us 
this could result in a change of business habits  and distributors may decide to decrease the amount of product held and reduce their inventory levels  which could impact availability to their customers 
as a result of the aforementioned factors regarding our distributors or other unrelated factors  the reseller customers of our distributors could decide to purchase products developed and manufactured by our competitors 
any loss of demand for our products by vars and system integrators could have a material adverse effect on our business or operating results 
we depend on our relationships with silicon chip suppliers and other subcontractors  and a loss of any of these relationships may lead to unpredictable consequences that may harm our results of operations if alternative supply sources are not available 
we currently rely on multiple foundries to manufacture our semiconductor products either in finished form or wafer form 
we generally conduct business with our foundries through written purchase orders as opposed to long term supply contracts 
therefore  these foundries are generally not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order 
if a foundry terminates its relationship with us or if our supply from a foundry is otherwise interrupted  we may not have a sufficient amount of time to replace the supply of products manufactured by that foundry 
as a result  we may not be able to meet customer demands  which could harm our business 
historically  there have been periods when there has been a worldwide shortage of advanced process technology foundry capacity 
the manufacture of semiconductor devices is subject to a wide variety of factors  including the availability of raw materials  the level of contaminants in the manufacturing environment  impurities in the materials used  and the performance of personnel and equipment 
we are continuously evaluating potential new sources of supply 
however  the qualification process and the production ramp up for additional foundries have in the past taken  and could in the future take  longer than anticipated 
new supply sources may not be able or willing to satisfy our silicon chip requirements on a timely basis or at acceptable quality or unit prices 

table of contents we have not developed alternate sources of supply for our products 
for example  our integrated single chip fibre channel controller is manufactured by lsi logic and integrates lsi logic s transceiver technology 
in the event that lsi logic is unable or unwilling to satisfy our requirements for this technology  our marketing efforts related to fibre channel products would be delayed and  as such  our results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
the requirement that a customer perform separate product qualifications  or a customer s inability to obtain a sufficient supply of products from us  may cause that customer to satisfy its product requirements from our competitors 
constraints or delays in the supply of our products  due to capacity constraints  unexpected disruptions at our foundries or with our subcontractors  delays in obtaining additional production at the existing foundries or in obtaining production from new foundries  shortages of raw materials or other reasons  could result in the loss of customers 
our products are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors that could lead to an increase in our costs  reduce our net revenues or damage our reputation 
our products are complex and may contain undetected software or hardware errors when first introduced or as newer versions are released 
we are also exposed to risks associated with latent defects in existing products 
we have from time to time found errors in existing  new or enhanced products 
the occurrence of hardware or software errors could adversely affect the sales of our products  cause us to incur significant warranty and repair costs  divert the attention of our engineering personnel from our product development efforts and cause significant customer relations problems 
the migration of our customers toward new products may result in fluctuations of our operating results 
as new or enhanced products are introduced  we must successfully manage the transition from older products in order to minimize the effects of product inventories that may become excess and obsolete  as well as ensure that sufficient supplies of new products can be delivered to meet customer demands 
our failure to manage the transition to newer products in the future or to develop and successfully introduce new products and product enhancements could adversely affect our business and financial results 
when we introduce new products and product enhancements  we face risks relating to product transitions  including risks relating to forecasting demand  as well as possible product and software defects 
if any of these factors were to occur  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
terrorist activities and resulting military actions could adversely affect our business 
terrorist attacks have disrupted commerce throughout the united states and europe 
the continued threat of terrorism within the united states  europe and the pacific rim  and the military action and heightened security measures in response to such threat  may cause significant disruption to commerce throughout the world 
to the extent that such disruptions result in delays or cancellations of customer orders  delays in collecting cash  a general decrease in corporate spending on information technology  or our inability to effectively market  manufacture or ship our products  our business and results of operations could be materially and adversely affected 
we are unable to predict whether the threat of terrorism or the responses thereto will result in any long term commercial disruptions or if such activities or responses will have any long term material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
because we depend on foreign customers and suppliers  we are subject to international economic  regulatory  political and other risks that could harm our financial condition and result of operations 
we expect that export revenues will continue to account for a significant percentage of our net revenues for the foreseeable future 
as a result  we are subject to several risks  which include a greater difficulty of administering our business globally  compliance with multiple and potentially conflicting regulatory requirements  such as export requirements  tariffs and other barriers  differences in intellectual property protections  
table of contents difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  potentially longer accounts receivable cycles  currency fluctuations  export control restrictions  overlapping or differing tax structures  political and economic instability  and general trade restrictions 
a significant number of our customers and suppliers are located in pacific rim countries 
historically  the asian markets have suffered from economic uncertainty 
this uncertainty has taken place especially in countries that have had a collapse in both their currency and stock markets 
these economic pressures have reduced liquidity in the banking systems of the affected countries and  when coupled with excess industrial production capacity  could lead to widespread financial difficulty among the companies in this region 
our export sales are invoiced in us dollars and  accordingly  if the relative value of the us dollar in comparison to the currency of our foreign customers should increase  the resulting effective price increase of our products to such foreign customers could result in decreased sales 
in addition  because we have customers and suppliers located in asia  the outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome sars could have an adverse impact on our business 
if there is a significant spread of sars beyond asia  other aspects of our business could be negatively impacted 
there can be no assurance that any of the foregoing factors will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may need to enter into agreements to guarantee we have production capacity  which may require us to seek additional financing and result in dilution to our stockholders 
the semiconductor industry has  in the past  experienced shortages of available foundry capacity 
accordingly  in order to secure an adequate supply of silicon chips  we may consider various possible supply agreements 
these agreements include the use of take or pay contracts  making equity investments in  or advances to  silicon chip manufacturing companies in exchange for guaranteed production capacity  or the formation of joint ventures to own and operate or construct foundries or to develop certain products 
any of these arrangements would involve financial risk to us and could require us to commit a substantial amount of our funds or provide technology licenses in return for guaranteed production capacity 
the need to commit our own funds may require us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
the sale or issuance of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
this kind of additional financing  if necessary  may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
we may engage in mergers  acquisitions and strategic investments and these activities may adversely affect our results of operations and stock price 
we anticipate that our future growth may depend in part on our ability to identify and acquire complementary businesses  technologies or product lines that are compatible with ours 
mergers and acquisitions involve numerous risks  including uncertainties in identifying and pursuing target companies  difficulties in the assimilation of the operations  technologies and products of the acquired companies  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks associated with entering markets or conducting operations with which we have no or limited direct prior experience  the potential loss of current customers or retention of the acquired company s customers  and the potential loss of key employees of the acquired company 

table of contents further  we may never realize the perceived benefits of a business combination 
future acquisitions by us could dilute stockholders investment and cause us to incur debt  contingent liabilities and amortization impairment charges related to intangible assets  all of which could materially adversely affect our financial position or results of operations 
we have made  and plan to continue to make  investments in technology companies  including privately held companies in a development stage 
many of these private equity investments are inherently risky because the companies businesses may never develop  and we may incur losses related to these investments 
in addition  we may be required to write down the carrying value of these investments to reflect other than temporary declines in their value  which could have a materially adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
our business could be materially adversely affected as a result of the risks associated with strategic alliances 
we have alliances with leading information technology companies and we plan to continue our strategy of developing key alliances in order to expand our reach into emerging markets 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in our ongoing strategic alliances or that we will be able to find further suitable business relationships as we develop new products and strategies 
any failure to continue or expand such relationships could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
there can be no assurance that companies with which we have strategic alliances  certain of which have substantially greater financial  marketing and technological resources than us  will not develop or market products in competition with us in the future  discontinue their alliances with us or form alliances with our competitors 
continued rapid growth will strain our operations and require that we incur costs to upgrade our infrastructure 
we have experienced a period of rapid growth and expansion in the past 
this rapid growth and expansion has placed  and continues to place  a significant strain on our resources 
unless we manage this growth effectively  we may encounter challenges in executing our business  such as sales forecasting  material planning and inventory management  which may result in unanticipated fluctuations in our operating results 
we may not be able to install adequate control systems in an efficient and timely manner  and our current or planned personnel  systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
in addition  we test most of our products prior to shipment 
if our capacity to conduct this testing does not expand concurrently with the anticipated growth of our business  product shipments could be delayed  which could result in delayed or lost revenues and customer dissatisfaction 
if we are unable to attract and retain key personnel  we may not be able to sustain or grow our business 
our future success largely depends on our key engineering  sales  marketing and executive personnel  including highly skilled semiconductor design personnel and software developers 
we also must identify and hire additional personnel 
if we lose the services of key personnel  our business would be adversely affected 
we believe that the market for key personnel in the industries in which we compete is highly competitive 
in particular  periodically we have experienced difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified engineers and other technical personnel and anticipate that competition for such personnel will increase in the future 
we may not be able to attract and retain key personnel with the skills and expertise necessary to develop new products in the future or to manage our business  both in the united states and abroad 
our proprietary rights may be inadequately protected and current and future infringement claims or adverse judgments could harm our competitive position 
although we have patent protection on certain aspects of our technology in some jurisdictions  we rely primarily on trade secrets  copyrights and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
there can be no assurance that these protections will be adequate to protect our proprietary rights  that others will not 
table of contents independently develop or otherwise acquire equivalent or superior technology or that we can maintain such technology as trade secrets 
there also can be no assurance that any patents we possess will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be developed  manufactured or sold  including various countries in asia  may not protect our products and intellectual property rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states or at all 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights  our business would be negatively impacted 
we have received notices of claimed infringement of intellectual property rights in the past 
in addition  we are currently engaged in litigation with parties who claim we have infringed on their intellectual property rights 
there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert additional claims of infringement of intellectual property rights against us with respect to existing and future products 
although patent and intellectual property disputes may be settled through licensing or similar arrangements  costs associated with these arrangements may be substantial and the necessary licenses or similar arrangements may not be available to us on satisfactory terms or at all 
as a result  we could be prevented from manufacturing and selling some of our products 
in addition  if we litigate these kinds of claims  the litigation could be expensive and time consuming and could divert management s attention from other matters 
our business could suffer regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
our supply of silicon chips and other components can also be interrupted by intellectual property infringement claims against our suppliers 
our charter document and shareholder rights plan may discourage companies from acquiring us and offering our stockholders a premium for their stock 
pursuant to our certificate of incorporation  our board of directors is authorized to approve the issuance of shares of currently undesignated preferred stock without any vote or future action by the stockholders 
pursuant to this authority  in june  our board of directors adopted a shareholder rights plan and declared a dividend of a right to purchase preferred stock for each outstanding share of our common stock 
after adjustment for stock splits  our common stock now carries one eighth of a preferred stock purchase right per share 
the shareholder rights plan may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change in control of our stock 
this may discourage bids for our common stock at a premium over the market price of the common stock and may adversely affect the market price of the common stock 
our corporate headquarters and principal design facilities are located in a region that is subject to earthquakes and other natural disasters 
our california facilities  including our principal executive offices  our principal design facilities  and our critical business operations are located near major earthquake faults 
we are not specifically insured for earthquakes  or other such natural disasters 
any personal injury or damage to the facilities as a result of such occurrences could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we maintain a marketable securities investment portfolio of various holdings  types and maturities 
in accordance with our investment guidelines  we only invest in instruments with high credit quality standards and we limit our credit exposure to any one issuer or type of investment 
we do not use derivative financial instruments 
our cash and cash equivalents are not subject to significant interest rate risk due to the short maturities of these instruments 
as of march   the carrying value of our cash and cash equivalents approximates fair value 
our short term investment portfolio consists primarily of marketable debt securities  including government securities  corporate bonds  municipal bonds and other debt securities  which principally have remaining terms of two years or less 
consequently  such securities are not subject to significant interest rate risk 
all of our marketable securities are classified as available for sale and  as of march   unrealized gains of million net of related income taxes on these securities are included in accumulated other comprehensive income
