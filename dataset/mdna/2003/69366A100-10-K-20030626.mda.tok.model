pps  effective for cost reporting periods beginning on or after july   limited government payments to long term care providers to federally established cost levels 
pps placed severe economic strain on the elder care business customers as reimbursements received from the government were substantially less than amounts received under the previous cost based reimbursement system 
the reduction in the amount of government reimbursements required significant changes to customer operations and their business models 
several large national chain customers were highly leveraged due to rapid expansion of their business and  in some cases  bankruptcy protection was the only alternative to counter the funding deficit 
as a result of this increased bad debt expense  changes in management s credit policies and procedures and changes in the credit and collection department management were implemented 
the effect of this change in estimate decreased basic and diluted earnings per share by for fiscal year the changes in the assumptions of estimating the allowances for doubtful accounts did not materially impact bad debt expense during fiscal year the elder care business benefited from the implementation of more stringent credit policies during fiscal year  the improvement in its customers financial condition  and the company s ability to negotiate shorter payment terms

application of critical accounting policies in preparing the consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  management is required to make certain estimates  judgments  and assumptions 
these estimates  judgments  and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which management and the audit committee believe are the most critical to fully understand and evaluate the company s financial position and results of operations include the following 
the discussion below applies to each of the company s reportable segments physician business  elder care business  and corporate overhead  which includes unallocated corporate overhead  overhead associated with the imaging business  and the company s european operations the international business  unless otherwise noted 
the international business was sold during fiscal year estimating allowances for doubtful accounts the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability to collect outstanding amounts due from its customers 
the allowances include specific amounts for those accounts that are likely to be uncollectible  such as bankruptcies  and general allowances for those accounts that management currently believes to be collectible but later become uncollectible 
estimates are used to determine the allowances for bad debts and are based on historical collection experience  current economic trends  credit worthiness of customers  changes in customer payment terms  and percentages applied to the accounts receivable aging categories 
the percentage of each aging category that is reserved is determined by analyzing historical write offs and current trends in the credit quality of the customer base 
management performs ongoing credit evaluations by reviewing the customer s current financial information 
a credit review is performed on all customers in the elder care business  and a credit review is performed on new customers in the physician business 
at a minimum  each elder care customer account is reviewed annually 
adjustments to credit limits are made based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  additional allowances may be needed which will increase general and administrative expenses and decrease accounts receivable 

table of contents effective july   medicare s pps  which was applied to the long term care industry  limited government payments to long term care providers to federally established cost levels 
if there are changes to the government imposed limits on reimbursement of hospitals and other healthcare industry  adjustments to established allowances may be needed which may adversely affect accounts receivable  future sales  earnings  and results of operations 
during the quarter ended december   the company recorded million of bad debt expense to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts for the elder care business 
the increase to the allowance was primarily attributed to i changes in assumptions concerning customers in bankruptcy at that time and ii changes in the reserve percentages applied to various classes of nonbankrupt customers with aged accounts due to further deterioration in the financial condition as a result of the implementation of pps 
no material revisions have been made to the reserve methodology for the elder care business subsequent to the quarter ended december  inventory valuation inventories  which primarily consist of medical products and supplies and diagnostic equipment  are valued at the lower of cost  or market on a first in  first out basis 
as part of this valuation process  excess and slow moving inventories are reduced to estimated net realizable value 
the company s accounting for excess and slow moving inventory contains uncertainty because management must use judgment to estimate when the inventory will be sold and the quantities and prices at which the inventory will be sold in the normal course of business 
when preparing these estimates  management considers and reviews historical results  inventory quantities on hand  current operating trends  sales forecasts  and slow movement reports 
these estimates can be affected by a number of factors  including general economic conditions  supply interruption by a manufacturer  and other factors affecting demand for the company s inventory 
any adjustments to the valuation of inventory will be reflected as an increase to cost of goods sold and a reduction to inventory 
during fiscal year  the physician business recorded a million charge to cost of goods sold for a discontinued product line 
during fiscal year  candela corporation candela terminated a distribution agreement between the two companies and the company filed an arbitration proceeding with the american arbitration association against candela pss world medical  inc d b a physician sales service  claimant  v

candela filed counterclaims in the arbitration for breach of contract  seeking payment of million in outstanding invoices and alleged trademark infringement and violation of the massachusetts unfair business practices act 
the arbitrators ruled in favor of candela on may  the company had previously recorded a liability of approximately million for equipment purchased 
due to the termination of the distribution agreement  including termination of manufacturer support  installation services  and warranty coverage  the physician business recorded an additional million charge to cost of goods sold during fiscal year estimating accruals for vendor rebates the company receives transaction based and performance based rebates from third party vendors 
such rebates are classified as either i a reduction to cost of goods sold  ii a reduction of the cost incurred  or iii an increase to net sales in the accompanying statement of operations 
transaction based rebates are generally associated with a specific customer contract and are recognized as a reduction to cost of goods sold at the time the transaction occurs 
performance based rebates are typically measured against inventory purchases or sales volume levels and are received from the vendors at the time certain performance measures are achieved 
performance based rebates for contracts entered into subsequent to november  are recognized based on a systematic and rational allocation of the consideration to be received relative to the transaction that marks the progress of the company toward earning the rebate or refund  provided the amounts are probable and reasonably estimable 
therefore  management uses judgment and estimates to determine the amount of performance based rebates to recognize each period 
if the amounts are not probable and reasonably estimable  rebate income is recognized upon achieving the performance measure 
prior to november   rebate income was recognized in the period in which the performance measure was achieved 
if the facts and circumstances used by management to assess whether the performance targets will be achieved by the company change  the financial condition and the results of operations could materially change period to period 

table of contents estimating valuation allowances for deferred tax assets deferred income taxes are assessed for recoverability and valuation allowances are provided as necessary to reduce deferred income tax assets to amounts expected to be realized 
as of march   the company has net deferred income taxes of million  which is net of a valuation allowance of million 
should expectations of taxable income change in future periods  it may become necessary to increase the valuation allowance  which could affect the company s results of operations in the period such determination is made 
the company records income tax provision or benefit at a rate that is based on expected results for the fiscal year 
if future changes in market conditions cause actual results to be more or less favorable  adjustments to the effective income tax rate on a quarterly basis may be required 
estimating useful lives of property and equipment depreciation is computed using the straight line method over the following estimated useful lives of the respective classes of assets 
useful life equipment to years software to years leasehold improvements are amortized over the shorter of the lease term or the estimated useful lives 
management is required to use judgment in determining the estimated useful lives of such assets 
changes in business strategy  technology  or other factors  may shorten the useful lives of assets resulting in increased depreciation expense  which is an increase to general and administrative expenses  affecting results of operations in any given period 
furthermore  if there are changes to our business model that may affect the estimated useful life of an asset  accelerated depreciation may be recorded which will impact the company s results of operations 
during fiscal years   and  the company revised the useful lives of certain assets in accordance with apb and recorded accelerated depreciation of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
management estimates that approximately million of accelerated depreciation will be recorded during fiscal year accrued restructuring costs and expenses in order to improve customer service  reduce costs  and improve productivity and asset utilization  management may develop formal plans to exit certain activities  involuntarily terminate employees  and relocate employees 
these plans may include identification of duplicate facilities for closure  identification of facilities for consolidation into other facilities  and consolidation of certain back office functions 
generally  completion of these plans will occur within one year from the date in which the plans were formalized and adopted by management 
however  intervening events occurring prior to completion of a plan can impact a previously established plan 
such intervening events may cause modifications to a plan and are accounted for on a prospective basis 
at the end of each quarter  management reevaluates its plans and adjusts previous estimates  if necessary

accrued restructuring costs and expenses are included in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets 
certain costs are recognized at the date in which a plan is formalized and adopted by management the commitment date 
certain other costs that do not meet the criteria for accrual at the commitment date are expensed as a plan is 
table of contents implemented 
the types of costs incurred related to exit and disposal activities are typically employee terminations  lease terminations  and branch shutdowns 
involuntary employee termination costs include employee severance costs and termination benefits 
lease termination costs include lease cancellation fees  forfeited deposits and remaining payments due under existing lease agreements less estimated sublease income 
branch shutdown costs include costs related to facility closure costs  and are estimated based on historical experience of the total costs incurred in exiting a facility and quotes obtained from vendors 
given the complexity of estimates and broad reaching scope of the restructuring plans  actual expenses could differ from management s estimates 
if actual results are different from original estimates  the company will record additional expense or reverse previously recorded expense 
legal contingencies as discussed in note  commitments and contingencies  the company is currently involved in certain legal proceedings 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies  if it is probable that an asset had been impaired or a liability had been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss is estimatable  an accrual for the costs to resolve these claims is recorded in accrued expenses in the accompanying balance sheets 
professional fees related to these claims are included in general and administrative expenses in the accompanying statements of operations 
management  with the assistance of outside counsel  determines whether it is probable that a liability has been incurred and estimates the amount of loss 
the analysis is based upon potential results  assuming a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
management does not believe these proceedings will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions related to these proceedings 
impairment of goodwill  intangibles  and other long lived assets effective march   the company adopted sfas  which requires that goodwill no longer be amortized  but instead be tested for impairment annually and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount may be impaired 
goodwill is reviewed for impairment based upon reporting units  which are defined as operating segments or one level below an operating segment 
the physician business and the elder care business are separate reporting units 
the company performs its annual impairment test as of the last day of each fiscal year  which is the friday closest to march as a result of adopting sfas during fiscal year  the imaging business recorded an impairment charge of million  net of income taxes of million  which is included in discontinued operations in the accompanying statement of operations 
refer to note  goodwill  for further discussion of the impact of sfas on the company s financial position and results of operations 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas  long lived assets  other than goodwill  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
the following factors  if present  may trigger an impairment review i a significant decrease in the market price of the long lived asset  ii a significant adverse change in the extent or manner in which the long lived asset is being used or in its physical condition  and iii a current period operating or cash flow loss combined with a history of operating cash flow losses or projection or forecast that demonstrates continuing losses associated with the use of the long lived asset 
if the recoverability of these assets is unlikely because of the existence of one or more of the above mentioned factors  an impairment analysis is performed using a projected undiscounted cash flow method 
the carrying amount of a long lived asset is not recoverable if it exceeds the sum of the undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
the impairment loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the long lived asset exceeds fair value 
management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these respective assets 
if these estimates or related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record an impairment charge

in addition  sfas amends the disclosure provisions of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the effects on reported net income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock based employee compensation 
certain of the disclosure modifications are required for fiscal year and are included in the notes to these consolidated financial statements 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a final consensus on issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor eitf  which addresses how a reseller of a vendor s product should account for cash consideration received from a vendor 
the eitf issued guidance on the following two issues cash consideration received from a vendor should be recognized as a reduction to cost of sales in the reseller s income statement  unless the consideration represents a reimbursement for selling costs or payment for assets or services delivered to the vendor  and performance driven vendor rebates or refunds eg  minimum purchase or sales volumes should be recognized only if the payment is considered probable and estimatable  and the method of allocating such payments in the financial statements should be systematic and rational based on the reseller s progress in achieving the underlying performance targets 
the provisions of item above have been applied to the company s financial statements beginning with the quarter ended march  certain payments received from a vendor that are were reflected as a reduction to general and administrative expenses were reclassified to net sales 
prior periods were not reclassified to conform to current year presentation as amounts were immaterial 
the provisions of item above  as required  have been applied to all new contracts entered into subsequent to november  the impact of item did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated results of operations in the current year 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 multiple deliverable revenue arrangements eitf 
eitf provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
the consensus mandates how to identify whether goods or services or both that are to be delivered separately in a bundled sales arrangement should be accounted for separately because they are separate units of accounting 
eitf can affect the timing of revenue recognition for such arrangements  even though it does not change rules governing the timing or pattern of revenue 
table of contents recognition of individual items accounted for separately 
the final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into beginning fiscal year with early adoption permitted 
the company believes that its current accounting is consistent with the provisions of eitf and  therefore  does not expect that the application of the provisions of eitf will have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations

fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees issued 
the interpretation also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin are applicable to guarantees issued or modified after december  fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations on the date of adoption

in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity sfas  which improves the accounting for certain financial instruments that  under previous guidance  issuers could account for as equity 
sfas  which is effective for interim periods beginning after june   requires that those instruments be classified as liabilities in statements of financial position 
the company is currently evaluating the effect of sfas on the balance sheet  results of operations  and cash flows 
factors that may affect future results the company s net sales and operating results may fluctuate quarterly as a result of many factors  including fluctuating demand for the company s products and services  the introduction of new products and services by the company and competitors  seasonal vaccine sales  acquisitions  dispositions or investments  changes in manufacturers pricing policies and or terms  changes in manufacturers strategy to utilize distribution  changes in the level of operating expenses  changes in estimates used by management  product supply shortages  
table of contents product recalls by manufacturers  inventory valuation adjustments  changes in product mix  general competitive and economic conditions  inclement weather  changes in accounting principles  disruptions resulting from the implementation of the strategic business plan  disruptions resulting from the implementation of the erp systems  and changes by the government in reimbursement rates 
accordingly  management believes that period to period comparisons of the results of operations should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
it is possible that in certain future periods the results of operations may be below analysts and investors expectations 
this could materially and adversely affect the trading price of the company s common stock 
pricing and customer credit quality pressures due to reduced spending budgets by healthcare providers may affect net sales  the collectability of accounts receivable  and earnings 
a significant portion of medical care costs in the united states of america are funded by government and private insurance programs  such as medicare  medicaid  and corporate health insurance plans 
in recent years  government imposed limits on reimbursement of hospitals  physicians  and other healthcare providers have significantly impacted spending budgets in certain markets within the medical products industry 
in particular  recent changes in the medicare program have limited payments to providers in the long term care industry  the principal customers of the elder care business 
for cost reporting periods beginning on or after july   medicare s pps was applied to the long term care industry 
pps limits government payments to long term care providers to federally established cost levels 
under pps  the customers of the elder care business received reimbursements that were substantially less than they received under the previous cost based reimbursement system 
the industry estimates that approximately of long term care facilities have filed for bankruptcy protection 
over one hundred of the elder care business customers filed for bankruptcy during through one of the elder care business customers is currently in bankruptcy and represented approximately   and of the elder care business net sales for the fiscal years ended march   march   and march   respectively  and less than of the company s consolidated net sales during each of the years in the three year period ending march  the government is constantly changing the reimbursement rates and rules of the pps 
future changes could have a material adverse effect on the company s future sales and results of operations 
the company s business is dependent on sophisticated data processing systems that may impair business operations if they fail to operate properly or not as anticipated 
the success of the company s business relies on the ability to obtain  process  analyze  maintain  and manage data 
in addition  data processing capabilities must be continually maintained and upgraded 
management relies on this capability because rebates are received from manufacturers when certain products are sold and sophisticated systems to track  apply  and collect such rebates are needed  product cost information  net of rebates  is needed by the sales force in a timely manner to conduct business  customer orders must be received and processed quickly  orders must be shipped on a timely basis  the billing and collections for all customers must be managed  the purchasing and distribution of over  inventory items from service centers must be managed  data and information systems must be converted after acquisitions and during operating system conversions  product reporting and tracking for vendors is a requirement  sales representative compensation is based on gross margin by product and by customer  and regulatory compliance on certain products requires proper tracking and reporting 

table of contents the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations may be materially adversely affected if  among other things data processing capabilities are interrupted or fail for any extended length of time  data services fail to be upgraded  the data processing system becomes unable to support expanded business  or data is lost or unable to be stored or processed 
the company s strategy for growth may not result in additional revenue or operating income and may have an adverse effect on working capital and earnings 
a key component of the company s business strategy is to increase sales to both existing and new customers  including large chains  independent operators  and provider groups 
the company intends to accomplish this by developing innovative marketing and distribution programs  hiring additional direct sales or other personnel  increasing the national sales efforts  expanding e commerce initiatives and development  improving distribution capability and efficiency through systems development and implementation  finalizing the rationalization of the distribution network  and improving supply chain efficiency through centralization and systems implementation 
there can be no assurance that these efforts will result in additional revenues or operating income 
the company may face competitive pricing pressures as it focuses on increasing sales to large chains and consolidating provider groups 
we are expanding our business with large chains and consolidating provider groups  especially in the long term care market 
this may result in competitive pricing pressures due to additional negotiating leverage of large chains  vendor agreements containing volume discounts  customer volume specifications  service specifications  negotiating favorable customer contracts  maintaining existing customer contracts  and predicting activity of competitors 
the company s rationalization programs and erp conversion may not increase efficiencies or produce cost savings 
the company may not increase efficiencies to offset increased depreciation expense from large capital expenditure investment 
the company believes it long term competitiveness is dependent on these efficiencies 
the company depends heavily on superior and unique distributorship agreements  the loss of any of which could reduce revenues and earnings 
the company distributes over  medical products manufactured by approximately  vendors 
the company relies on these vendors for the manufacture and supply of products 
during the year ended march   no vendors accounted for more than of the company s consolidated inventory purchases 

table of contents the company s ability to maintain good relations with vendors affects our profitability 
currently  the company relies on vendors to provide field sales representatives technical and selling support  agreeable purchasing and delivery terms  sales performance incentives  financial support of sales and marketing programs  promotional materials  and acceptable pricing and terms 
there can be no assurance that the company will maintain good relations with its vendors 
the elder care business depends on a limited number of large customers 
the elder care business depends on a limited number of large customers for a significant portion of its net sales 
the elder care business has long term contracts with each of its largest customers 
the occurrence of a consolidation or divestiture  whereby the elder care business were to lose a significant  large customer or portion thereof  could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
in prior years  the elder care business experienced failure to collect accounts receivable from some of its largest customers and an adverse change in the financial condition of its customers could have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations or financial condition 
acquisitions may decrease shareholders percentage ownership in pssi and require the company to incur additional debt 
future acquisitions or investments may be financed by issuance of equity securities that could be dilutive to shareholders 
additionally  the company may incur additional debt and amortization expense related to other intangible assets 
this additional debt and amortization expense may significantly reduce profitability and adversely affect the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
any goodwill recorded in connection with future or existing acquisitions will require an annual impairment test which compares the carrying amount to the fair value of the reporting unit under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
if the company cannot integrate acquired companies within the business  profitability may be adversely affected 
although the company may acquire additional companies in the future  pssi may be unable to successfully integrate the acquired businesses and realize anticipated economic  operational  and other benefits in a timely manner 
integration of an acquired business is especially difficult when the acquired business is in a market in which the company has limited or no expertise  or with a different corporate culture 
if the company is unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses substantial costs and delays may be incurred  operational  technical or financial problems may be experienced  management s attention and other resources may be diverted  and relationships with key clients and employees may be damaged 
the company s indebtedness may limit the ability to obtain additional financing in the future and may limit the flexibility to react to industry or economic conditions 
the company has a revolving line of credit with a syndicate of lenders for million  with million outstanding at march  additional borrowings under the revolving line of credit are subject to a borrowing base arrangement dependent upon the quality of the company s outstanding accounts receivable and inventory 
any deterioration in the realizability of these assets could reduce the amount available under the revolving line of credit 
in addition  the stock repurchase programs that were adopted during fiscal year will reduce cash available for operations and debt reduction 

table of contents the level of the pssi indebtedness could limit the company s ability to obtain additional financing in the future for working capital  limit the company s ability to make capital expenditures  limit the company s acquisition activity  limit the company s flexibility in reacting to changes in the industry and economic conditions in general  and adversely affect the company s liquidity because a substantial portion of cash flow must be dedicated to debt service and will not be available for other purposes 
management believes that cash flow  together with available borrowings  is sufficient to meet operating expenses and service debt requirements in the future 
this belief assumes  among other things  that the business strategy will be successfully implemented and that there will be no material adverse developments in the business  liquidity  or capital requirements 
however  if the company is unable to generate sufficient cash flow from operations to service the indebtedness  the company will be forced to adopt an alternative strategy that may include the following options reducing or delaying acquisitions and capital expenditures  selling assets  restructuring or refinancing the indebtedness  and seeking additional equity capital 
the company faces litigation and liability exposure for existing and potential claims 
the company is subject to various legal and administrative proceedings and claims arising in the normal course of business  which are described in note  commitments and contingencies 
the outcome of such proceedings or claims that are unasserted  pending  or known to be threatened could have a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position  liquidity  or results of operations 
the company must retain the services of senior management 
the company s success depends largely on the efforts and abilities of our senior management  particularly the president and chief executive officer 
the loss of the services of one or more of such individuals may adversely affect the company s business 
because of the decentralized operating infrastructure  the company is also dependent upon the operations and sales managers at each distribution center  and other key corporate officers 
pssi must hire and retain qualified sales representatives to continue the company s sales growth 
the company s ability to retain existing customers and attract new customers is dependent upon hiring and developing new sales representatives  adding established sales representatives whose existing customers become customers of the company  and retaining those sales representatives 
an inability to adequately hire or retain sales representatives or service specialists could limit our ability to expand our business and grow sales 
due to relationships developed between the company s representatives and specialists and their customers  upon the departure of a representative and specialist  we face the risk of losing the representative s and specialist s customers 
this is particularly a risk where the representative goes to work as a representative or specialist for a competitor 
we generally require our sales representatives and service specialists to execute a noncompetition agreement as a condition of employment 
we have not  however  obtained these agreements from some of these employees 
in addition  certain state courts do not always uphold the terms of noncompetition agreements 

table of contents the company may not be able to continue to compete successfully with other medical supply companies and direct manufacturers 
the medical supply distribution market is very competitive 
the company s operating results could be materially adversely affected if the company s competitors should lower prices of products similar to those distributed by the company and the company matches competitive pricing 
our principal competitors include full line and full service multimarket medical distributors and direct manufacturers  many of which are national in scope 
many of these competitors have sales representatives competing directly with us  are substantially larger in size  have substantially greater financial resources than we do  have lower product costs  and have lower operating costs 
we also face significant competition from regional and local dealers and mail order firms 
several of our mail order competitors distribute medical supplies on a national  regional or local basis and have less operating costs including less or no sales tax charges to customers 
continued consolidation within the healthcare industry may lead to increased competition 
consolidation within the healthcare industry has resulted in increased competition by direct manufacturers  large national distributors  and drug wholesalers 
in response to competitive pressures  the company has lowered and may continue to lower selling prices in order to maintain or increase its market share 
these lower selling prices have resulted  and may continue to result  in lower gross margins 
the company could face additional competition because many manufacturers are capable of directly marketing to our customers  many products can be readily obtained by competitors from various suppliers  competitors could obtain exclusive rights to market a product  national hospital distributors  drug wholesale distributors  and healthcare manufacturers could begin focusing their efforts more directly on the company s markets  hospitals that form alliances with long term care facilities to create integrated healthcare networks may look to hospital distributors and manufacturers to supply their long term care affiliates  and as provider networks are created through consolidation among physician provider groups  long term care facilities and other alternate site providers  purchasing decisions may shift to people with whom the company has no selling relationship 
therefore  management cannot assure that the company will be able to maintain customer relationships in such circumstances  increase operating margins if provider consolidations occur  and avoid increased competition and significant pricing pressure in the future 
the significant investment in inventory may be exposed to risk of product obsolescence or market valuation 
in order to provide prompt and complete service to customers  the company maintains a significant investment in inventory at the distribution centers 
although there are inventory control procedures and policies in place that monitor the risk of product obsolescence or declining market prices  management cannot assure you that such procedures and policies will continue to be effective  the demand for certain product lines will continue  unforeseen product development or price changes will not occur  or the write off of any unsold inventory in the future will not be significant 

table of contents in addition  acquired inventory may include different product lines that are not normally distributed by the company 
these product lines may be difficult to sell and  therefore  result in a write off if such inventory is not saleable in the future 
any inventory write offs could have a material adverse effect on the business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the expansion of the two tiered pricing structure may place pssi at a competitive disadvantage 
the medical products industry is subject to a two tier pricing structure 
under this structure  certain institutions  originally limited to nonprofit hospitals  can obtain more favorable prices for medical products than the company 
the two tiered pricing structure continues to expand as many large integrated healthcare providers and others with significant purchasing power demand more favorable pricing terms 
although the company is seeking to obtain similar terms from manufacturers  management cannot assure that such terms will be obtained 
if such pricing structure persists  pssi may be at a competitive disadvantage 
the articles of incorporation  bylaws  rights agreement  and florida law may inhibit a takeover of the company 
the company s articles of incorporation and bylaws and florida law contain provisions that may delay  deter  or inhibit a future acquisition 
this could occur even if our shareholders are offered an attractive value for their shares of common stock or if a substantial number or even a majority of the company s shareholders believe the takeover is in their best interest 
these provisions are intended to encourage any person interested in acquiring the company to negotiate with and obtain the approval of the board of directors in connection with any transaction 
a staggered board of directors  the state of florida s affiliated transaction statute  or the state of florida s control share acquisition statute could delay  deter  or inhibit potential offers to acquire the company 
in addition  the rights of holders of the company s common stock will be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of preferred stock that may be issued in the future and that may be senior to the rights of holders of common stock 
on april   the board of directors approved a shareholder protection rights agreement that provides for one preferred stock purchase right in respect of each share of common stock 
these rights become exercisable upon a person or group of affiliated persons acquiring or more of the company s then outstanding common stock by all persons other than an existing shareholder 
this rights agreement also could discourage bids for shares of common stock at a premium and could have a material adverse effect on the market price of the common stock 
if pssi becomes involved in environmental claims  the company could incur substantial liabilities and costs 
the company s operations and properties are subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulations relating to environmental matters 
as such  we may be responsible for the investigation and remediation of property contaminated by hazardous  toxic  or other chemical substances  regardless of whether the company is responsible for such contamination 
the costs of such investigation and remediation requirements may be substantial 
in addition  we could be held liable to governmental entities or third parties for any property damage  personal injury  and investigation and cleanup costs incurred by such parties in connection with the contamination 
these costs and liabilities could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
management believes that the company s exposure to environmental liabilities under current applicable laws is not material 
however  environmental laws and regulations can change rapidly  which could subject the company to more stringent environmental laws and regulations in the future 
the costs of complying with more stringent standards  as well as any liabilities associated with noncompliance with such standards imposed on the company  may result in a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition  and results of operations 
the company s customer viability may be threatened by increasing costs of malpractice claims and liability insurance 
insurance rates for the customers of the elder care business have increased as high as while many physicians in the physician business are experiencing increases 
if legislation is not effective in reducing these rates  many of the company s customers may be adversely effected which could affect their financial viability 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk the following assessment of the company s market risk does not include uncertainties that are either nonfinancial or nonquantifiable  such as political uncertainty  economic uncertainty  impact of future tax legislation  and credit risks 
changes in interest rates affect interest payments under the company s variable rate financing arrangement 
during fiscal year and  the company s debt obligations were comprised of the million senior subordinated notes and borrowings under the revolving line of credit  which bears interest at either the bank s prime rate plus a margin of between and or at libor plus a margin of between and 
during fiscal year  the company retired million principal amount of the senior subordinated notes using proceeds from the revolving line of credit and cash flows from operations 
as of march  and march   the company had million and  respectively  outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
a hypothetical increase in interest rates of basis points would result in a potential reduction in future pre tax earnings of approximately million per year for every million outstanding under the revolving line of credit 
subsequent to year end  the company entered into a million interest rate swap to mitigate a portion of its exposure to interest rate movements 
changes in interest rates also affect rates of return on the company s cash equivalents and short term investments  which generally consist of money market accounts  commercial paper  and government securities 
a hypothetical decrease in interest rates of basis points would result in a potential reduction in future pre tax earnings of approximately million per year for every million of short term investments 
due to the short term nature of the company s investments  typically less than day maturities  the impact of a similar basis point change in interest rates would have an immaterial impact on the carrying value of an investment 
as of march   the company did not hold any derivative financial or commodity instruments
