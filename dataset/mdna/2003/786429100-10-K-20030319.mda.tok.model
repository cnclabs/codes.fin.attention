table of contents because insurance rates in some jurisdictions are subject to regulatory review and approval  our achievement of rate increases may occur in amounts and on a time schedule different than planned  which may affect efforts to continue to restore profitability in our property casualty lines 
overview safeco corporation is a washington corporation that has been in the insurance business since we operate subsidiaries on a nationwide basis in segments of the insurance industry and other financial services related businesses 
our two principal businesses are property and casualty insurance  including surety  and life insurance and asset management 
these activities generated nearly all of our revenues in throughout this report  safeco corporation and its subsidiaries are referred to as safeco  we and our 
the property and casualty insurance related businesses  including surety  are referred to as property casualty 
the life insurance and asset management businesses are referred to as life investments 
all other activities  primarily involving financing  are collectively referred to as corporate 
our property casualty operations generated of our consolidated revenues in application of critical accounting policies we have identified the accounting policies below as critical to understanding our results of operations and financial condition 
the application of these accounting policies requires management to use judgments involving assumptions and estimates concerning future results  trends or other developments that could significantly influence our results should actual experience differ from those assumptions and estimates 
these judgments are reviewed frequently by senior management  and an understanding of them may enhance the reader s understanding of our consolidated financial statements and md a 
property casualty loss and loss adjustment expense reserves safeco s consolidated financial statements include estimated reserves for unpaid losses and related claim settlement or loss adjustment expenses lae of our property casualty businesses 
we record loss and lae reserves at each balance sheet date at management s best estimate of the ultimate payments that will be made to settle all losses incurred at that date and to pay related expenses 
the process of estimating loss and lae reserves involves significant judgment and is complex and imprecise due to the number of variables and assumptions inherent in the estimation process 
these variables include the effects on ultimate loss payments of internal factors such as changes in claims handling practices and changes in business mix  as well as external factors such as trends in loss costs  economic inflation  judicial trends and legislative changes 
in addition  certain claims may be paid out over many years  for example  workers compensation medical costs for severe injuries  and there may be significant lags between the occurrence of an insured event and the time it is actually reported to us  contributing to the variability in estimating ultimate loss payments 
variables such as these affect the reserving process in a variety of ways and the impacts of many of these variables cannot be directly quantified  particularly on a prospective basis 
as a result of the inherent variability in estimating reserves  we use a number of actuarial techniques to estimate loss and lae reserves 
standard actuarial techniques rely on the premise that historic loss experience can be used to estimate future loss experience 
however  safeco has undergone substantial transformation since  including new product launches  changes in underwriting criteria and improvements in claim handling practices 
these actions serve to improve business performance but also affect loss trends and actuarial data 
as a result  safeco has employed a more sophisticated set of actuarial techniques to assess the variables affecting loss experience in certain lines of business and applied multiple actuarial techniques to lines with the greatest volatility 
in some cases  these actuarial techniques produce a cluster of estimates  giving management confidence that the reserve estimate is within a relatively tight band of possible outcomes 
in other cases  however  additional techniques produce conflicting results 
management reviews reserve indications and the assumptions underlying them in applying the judgments necessary to determine its best estimate for safeco s carried reserves 
due to the assumptions and judgments inherent in the estimation of loss and lae reserves  actual experience may differ from these estimates 
we refine reserve estimates in an ongoing quarterly process as experience develops 
we record adjustments to reserves in our results of operations in the periods in which we change the estimate 
safeco form k 
table of contents our loss and lae reserves before reinsurance by operating segment as of december  are summarized below december safeco personal insurance safeco business insurance surety property casualty other total safeco personal insurance spi reserves of  at december  are comprised of personal auto reserves of  and homeowners and specialty lines reserves of personal automobile personal automobile policies provide coverage for bodily injury and property damage 
while loss frequencies have been decreasing in  we have assumed flattening of this trend in our reserve estimates 
variability in personal auto reserve estimates is primarily driven by bodily injury claim severity trends average claim costs  which reflect inflationary trends for medical costs 
automobile bodily injury paid loss severity on claims that closed in increased over the incurred severity on claims reported in increased over management believes that incurred severity increases include the effects of claim department activities since these activities include focused settlement efforts and improved case reserve measurement processes  which will serve to reduce loss severity over time 
however  until the benefits of such actions are evidenced in our loss development experience  and in view of the uncertainties inherent in estimating the effects of medical inflation  management s estimate of reserves for this coverage has assumed an aggregate loss severity trend of other lines homeowners and specialty personal lines coverages are short tailed in nature with most claims generally reported and settled within months 
reserve estimates are based on standard loss development techniques  which produced consistent reserve estimates based on our overall experience 
safeco business insurance sbi reserves totaled  at december   comprised of workers compensation reserves of  commercial multiperil reserves of  commercial auto reserves of  asbestos and environmental reserves of  construction defect reserves of  business owners policy reserves of and all other reserves of sbi has exposure to construction defect  asbestos  environmental and other toxic tort losses through the general liability and commercial multiperil coverages it provides 
these exposures and the risks they present to safeco are discussed in the p c other segment below  where the majority of the exposure resides 
the remainder of the sbi reserve discussion excludes these exposures 
for sbi  workers compensation reserves are subject to the greatest uncertainty and subjectivity in their estimation 
the key assumptions and the inherent variability in reserving for these losses are described below 
safeco form k 
table of contents workers compensation the following table presents the loss and allocated lae reserves before reinsurance related to voluntary and non voluntary workers compensation 
the table excludes unallocated lae reserves which were as of december  december losses and allocated lae payments reserves at end of year  before reinsurance earned premium claims number of claims reported claims in the year open claims at the end of the year declining premium volumes in and are consistent with safeco s strategy to limit its workers compensation writings in states where rate levels fall below safeco s return targets 
in particular  safeco significantly restricted writing new workers compensation business in california beginning in the third quarter of this decline in business volume has led to lower claim activity  which has served to reduce reserves 
this is partially offset by rising loss costs 
workers compensation claims are largely comprised of medical costs and salary wage payments while claimants are out of work 
the payout period for these claims can be years or more 
safeco s average payout period is generally shorter than the industry as a whole due to our historical focus on low hazard risks 
workers compensation reserves are subject to a greater degree of uncertainty than most reserves due to the late reporting nature of certain of the claims  the long term payout period of many claims and the resulting impact of inflationary trends over time  particularly for medical costs  and the impact of legislative actions and judicial interpretations in establishing prescribed benefits 
currently  medical inflation trends are resulting in significant increases to paid losses  particularly in the state of california 
the rate of change in medical inflation and payment trends may impact our estimates in future periods due to the difficulty of precisely estimating the pattern of such trends over the claim payout period 
workers compensation reserves may also be impacted by our claim practices 
since late  we have placed greater emphasis on full exposure recognition in case reserving and on settlement of long term claims 
while management has assumed that these actions will modestly improve our ultimate loss trends  these activities impact our claim trend data and actuarial analysis and  as a result  increase the variability in our reserve estimates 
in determining management s best estimate for workers compensation reserves  long term medical cost inflation trends over the average claim payout period represent our most significant assumption 
we have assumed that double digit medical cost inflation will continue in the near term  moderating over time to historic levels  resulting in a medical loss severity trend over the life of the reserves 
our best estimate of workers compensation reserves presents some risk of unfavorable reserve development should medical trends not abate 
other sbi other sbi reserves comprise loss and lae reserves for commercial multiperil policies  monoline property  monoline general liability other than construction defects  asbestos  environmental and other toxic tort claims  which are discussed separately below  commercial automobile and commercial umbrella 
these reserves are analyzed quarterly using standard actuarial methodologies 
the duration of payout for these products is relatively short  and the loss cost trends for the shorter tailed lines have been stable to improving 
these factors result in more predictive experience for reserving than is the case for workers compensation 
surety surety loss and lae reserves totaled at december  by their nature  surety contracts produce lower loss frequency and higher loss severity than much of safeco s property casualty business 
in addition  surety safeco form k 
table of contents claims provide substantial opportunity for subrogation and salvage the nature of which tends to vary from case to case 
as a result of the underlying nature of surety losses and the limited historical data available for analyses  management relies on large claim analysis and individual insured exposure analysis of loss as well as subrogation and salvage potential to determine carried reserves 
actual subrogation and salvage recoveries in the future or changes in loss trends due to changes in the economy may affect management s estimate of surety reserves 
property casualty other p c other reserves totaled at december  and are comprised of construction defect reserves of  asbestos and environmental reserves of  reserves for our london operations that are in runoff of and other reserves of in the discussion that follows we have combined the sbi and p c other operating segment reserves for construction defects  asbestos  environmental and other toxic tort claims 
accordingly  the tables below include statistics for both segments 
construction defect exposures the following table presents the loss and allocated lae reserves before reinsurance for liability coverages related to construction defect claims 
the table excludes unallocated lae reserves which were as of december december losses and allocated lae payments reserves at end of year  before and after reinsurance claims and average costs number of claims and dollars number of claims pending at end of year average settlement cost  including legal expenses safeco has exposure to construction defect losses through general liability and commercial multiperil coverages it provides to contractors 
construction defect claims arise from alleged defective work performed in the construction of large habitation structures  such as apartments  condominiums and large developments of single family dwellings or other housing 
in addition to damages arising directly from the alleged defective work  construction defect claims often also allege that the economic value of the structure has been diminished 
the majority of safeco s losses have been concentrated in a limited number of states  including california  and safeco has taken a number of underwriting actions to mitigate this exposure 
prior to the acquisition of american states  we avoided writing the construction class of business in california and ceased writing these coverages in american states was a major writer of california contractor business until when it implemented significant restrictions in this line 
the process of estimating reserves for these claims involves subjectivity different than our other lines due to the changing legal and regulatory environment  including statutes of limitations in filing these claims and the impact of diminished value claims 
in addition  estimates are more subjective due to the involvement of multiple plaintiffs  defendants and insurers and the potentially long period of time between the accident date and the date the claim is reported 
because of the underlying nature of the claims and the difficulty inherent in determining fault in alleged construction defect claims  safeco has established a separate claims handling and adjudication function to address these claims 
as a part of this claims handling and adjudication function  safeco has developed expertise in internal counsel  and has established relationships  particularly in california  with external legal counsel specializing in construction defect claims allowing us to vigorously defend our coverage position 
safeco estimates its ultimate liability for construction defects using techniques developed specifically for this purpose 
this includes estimation of future claim reporting and the average value of each claim and includes adjustments for changes in coverage interpretations  changes in regulation and judicial rulings  and changes in plaintiff attorney involvement 
as the table above indicates  claim inventories for construction defect have decreased steadily over the last two years  annualized at per year 
management s reserve estimate assumes that the safeco form k 
table of contents inventory will continue to decrease  but at a slower rate  because management anticipates the continued expansion of construction defect claims outside of california and because of the erosion of statutes of limitations for loss reporting in certain jurisdictions 
management s estimate also contemplates a modest ability for safeco s claims handling and adjudication function to reduce construction defect loss severity  consistent with recent experience 
asbestos the following table presents the loss and allocated lae reserves before reinsurance for liability coverages related to asbestos claims 
the table excludes unallocated lae reserves which were as of december  for asbestos and environmental combined 
december losses and allocated lae payments reserves at end of year  before reinsurance reserves at end of year  net of reinsurance three year survival ratio  gross three year survival ratio  net claims and average costs number of claims and dollars  net of reinsurance number of claims pending at end of year average paid per closed claim n a average case reserve per open claim n a not available the three year survival ratio is calculated by dividing reserves at end of year by average annual payments for the three years then ended 
the majority of safeco s asbestos liability exposure approximately of asbestos reserves relates to the discontinued assumed reinsurance operations of american states 
this exposure relates primarily to reinsurance of excess coverage 
safeco also has exposure to syndicates and pools due to its historical writings  which resulted in increased paid activity during and may result in additional development in future periods 
our reserves for pools reflect the reserve estimates provided by the pool s independent actuaries 
the loss experience of our assumed reinsurance operations follows the general industry trend 
safeco s direct exposure approximately of asbestos reserves to asbestos liabilities primarily relates to the expansion of defendants to include smaller and more peripheral entities 
safeco s exposure to the major high profile asbestos defendants is limited as a result of our historic business strategy  which generally avoided writing direct coverages for larger companies 
safeco has no direct exposure to businesses or claims that are the subject of settlement agreements 
the process of estimating reserves for asbestos claims involves greater subjectivity than other claims 
past claim experience may not be representative of future claim experience due to a general lack of sufficiently detailed data  the risk inherent in major litigation  diverging legal interpretations  regulatory actions  the recent proliferation of bankruptcy proceedings  the extent to which non impaired claimants can be precluded from making claims  the efforts by insureds to obtain coverage not subject to aggregate limits  and other factors 
changes in these factors  particularly in the overall legal environment and the proliferation of these claims to peripheral defendants  could result in future claims significantly different from those currently predicted 
also  some asbestos related claims are subject to non product liability coverage rather than product liability coverage  and the non product liability coverage may not be subject to policy aggregate limits 
policyholders that have active asbestos claims are identified below in two separate groups based on their perceived level of exposure 
policyholders are defined as large asbestos accounts if their cumulative loss payments as of december  exceeded  the remaining policyholders are defined as small asbestos accounts 
unassigned ibnr represents of safeco s net asbestos reserves as of december  safeco form k 
table of contents the table below provides details on the breakdown of our policyholders by exposure category net of reinsurance as of december  number of policyholders net paid net asbestos reserves of asbestos reserves assumed reinsurance and pools policyholders with active claims large asbestos accounts small asbestos accounts total policyholders with active claims policyholders with settlement agreements unassigned ibnr total based on the unique nature of asbestos claims  safeco has established separate claims handling functions to address asbestos claims  separately for direct claims and assumed reinsurance claims 
our estimated asbestos reserves are based on consideration of the current state of the applicable law and coverage litigation 
actuarial estimates include ground up analysis based on a sampling of claims 
while safeco s level of asbestos payments has remained steady over the last two years excluding pools and syndicates  management s estimate assumes emerging unfavorable industry trends will begin to impact safeco s discontinued assumed reinsurance operations within the next two years and subsequently produce industry like loss patterns 
our analysis also assumes that future claims will have severities similar to past safeco experience 
environmental the following table presents the loss and allocated lae reserves before reinsurance for liability coverages related to environmental and other toxic tort claims 
the table excludes unallocated lae reserves which were as of year end for asbestos and environmental combined december losses and allocated lae payments reserves at end of year  before reinsurance reserves at end of year  net of reinsurance three year survival ratio  gross three year survival ratio  net claims and average costs number of claims and dollars  net of reinsurance number of claims pending at end of year average paid per closed claim n a average case reserve per open claim n a not available safeco s environmental claims arise from the discontinued assumed reinsurance operations of american states and from the commercial general liability line written on a direct basis 
safeco generally avoided writing coverages for larger companies with substantial exposures in these areas 
as a consequence  safeco s environmental claims tend to be of small relative average size 
unassigned ibnr represents of the of reserves  or of reserves as of december  safeco s estimated environmental and other toxic tort reserves are based on consideration of the current state of the applicable law and coverage litigation 
actuarial estimates of these ultimate liabilities are subject to greater than normal variability 
reasons for this include  but are not limited to  a general lack of sufficiently detailed data  expansion of the population being held responsible for these exposures  and significant unresolved legal issues safeco form k 
table of contents including such issues as the existence of coverage  the definition of ultimate damages  and the final allocation of such damages to financially responsible parties 
since safeco s environmental claims are relatively small in size  this exposure does not lend itself to ground up analysis 
the data is too volatile and too sparse to place sole reliance on standard actuarial techniques 
as a consequence  management relies upon analysis of claim statistics and trends  together with directional trends in survival ratios  to estimate the carried reserves 
property casualty reinsurance we use treaty and facultative reinsurance in managing our exposure to potential losses for property casualty 
reinsurance recoverables related to unpaid losses resulting from these operations were at december  because the amount of the reinsurance recoverable can vary depending on the loss activity before reinsurance is applied  the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverables is not known until all losses are settled 
to estimate reinsurance recoverables  we examine individual estimates of large losses subject to reinsurance treaties or facultative arrangements 
using the reinsurance contracts in place we estimate reinsurance recoverable amounts for specific claims as well as for lines of business 
this analysis includes the examination of past reinsurance recoverables  the examination of actuarial data with and without reinsurance recoverables  as well as actuarial analysis of loss development above and below relevant retention levels 
we also examine historical collection experience  recoverables associated with individual reinsurers including our largest exposures as well as our lower rated reinsurers  and recoverables concentrated around any particular issue for example  a large loss  a catastrophe  or an emerging claim issue to assure our recoverables are collectible 
our estimated allowance for uncollectible reinsurance at december  was valuation of investments we currently classify all of our fixed maturity and equity securities as available for sale and  accordingly  carry them at fair value 
fixed maturity securities include bonds  mortgage backed securities and redeemable preferred stock 
equity securities include common stock and non redeemable preferred stock 
we analyze all investments with a fair value below cost as of each quarterly reporting date to determine if an other than temporary decline in value has occurred 
the determination of whether a decline is other than temporary is made based on the relevant facts and circumstances related to the security 
these considerations include the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events that influence the operations of the issuer or that affect its future earnings potential  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value  a review of any downgrades of the security by a rating agency  and any reduction or elimination of dividends or non payment of scheduled interest payments 
determining what constitutes an other than temporary decline involves judgment 
declines in fair value below cost not considered other than temporary in the current period could be considered other than temporary in a future period and reduce earnings to the extent of the impairment 
fair value amounts for financial instruments are determined using available third party market information 
when such information is not available  the fair value amounts are determined using appropriate valuation methodologies including discounted cash flows and market prices of comparable instruments 
our investment portfolio includes of fixed maturities that are not publicly traded 
when third party market information is not available  fair values for these securities have been estimated using quoted market prices of comparable instruments based on industry sector  credit quality and maturity and or internally prepared valuations using third party modeling tools  which also typically use comparable instrument pricing techniques based on industry sector  credit quality and maturity 
judgment is required in developing certain of these estimates of fair value and the estimates may not represent amounts at december  that would be realized in a current market exchange 
safeco s investment portfolio includes of equity securities that are not publicly traded 
values for these securities are primarily determined using independent pricing sources 
sfp activities are not designated as hedging activities for purposes of sfas changes in the fair values of these instruments and any net realized investment gain or loss are recognized as net realized investment gains losses in the consolidated statements of income loss

table of contents strategic initiatives affecting the comparability of results of operations following safeco s expansion in the mid s into the large commercial account and specialty program business  as well as the acquisition of american states  safeco s net income declined from to during that period  our stock price underperformed both the s p index and the s p insurance index 
in  safeco s board of directors determined that it was necessary to conduct an overall review of our business to determine how to improve profitability 
in january  the board of directors hired michael s 
mcgavick as chief executive officer and president to redirect our operations 
upon joining  mr 
mcgavick undertook a focused review to address our poor property casualty profitability and to develop a strategic direction for safeco 
this review resulted in actions focused on addressing the following priorities ensure the success of the recovery plan for our property casualty operations  analyze and reduce expenses  strengthen our financial position  and invest in our employees 
actions taken to achieve these goals began promptly in and were substantially completed by the end of to assure the success of our recovery plan for our core lines  we refocused our core strengths in personal auto  small to medium commercial insurance  and life insurance and asset management 
several actions were taken with respect to property casualty operations including increasing rates and re underwriting across all lines of business  terminating relationships with underperforming agents  and exiting lines of business not core to our strategy and expertise 
in a rigorous company wide effort to reduce expenses  we implemented a plan to consolidate regional offices and reduce employment in our property casualty operations and corporate headquarters 
to strengthen our financial position  in we reduced our quarterly dividend by and sold safeco credit  reinvesting the proceeds in our property casualty business 
in the third quarter of  we strengthened property and casualty reserves by on a pretax basis  reflecting developments in prior year losses primarily from workers compensation  construction defect  asbestos and environmental claims 
we recognized goodwill write downs of  pretax 
we invested in our employees primarily by introducing a performance based compensation system based on the achievement of specific goals linked directly to our business plans and by developing a diversity program to prepare us to increase workforce effectiveness and to better compete in today s business world 
during  we took additional actions that continue in to reshape our business into a more profitable enterprise positioned for growth 
these actions include improving sales growth through independent agents  improving service and claims handling by reducing errors and improving our processes  driving execution through enhanced metrics and measurement practices  and continuing investment in our employees 
our results improved significantly as a result of these and prior actions discussed above  as well as favorable industry conditions and mild weather in safeco form k

the slight increase in property casualty earned premiums was driven by targeted growth in selected markets and premium rate increases across all lines of business 
life investments premiums and other revenues increased in primarily due to the acquisition of swiss re s stop loss medical business 
the increase in net investment income was primarily due to improved cash flows in property casualty operations  repositioning of the property casualty investment portfolio  and a higher invested asset base in life investments  offset in part by lower yields due to declining interest rates 
consolidated revenues in decreased in comparison to the  of revenues in  primarily from a decline in property casualty earned premiums of as a result of our re underwriting efforts  which included non renewing under priced risks and reducing under performing and unprofitable lines 
this decrease was partially offset by growth in life investments revenues driven by premium rate increases and an increase in investment income 
revenues also were impacted by net realized pretax investment gains of  and in  and  respectively 
included in net realized investment gains were impairment charges of  and in  and  respectively 
the higher impairment losses in and reflect credit deterioration and failures of certain corporations in which we have invested 
consolidated net income was in  compared to a net loss of in and net income of in the increase in consolidated net income in over our loss in was driven primarily by improved underwriting results within the property casualty operations  increased earnings in life investments and certain significant charges in these charges consisted principally of a goodwill write off of  pretax  third quarter property and casualty reserve strengthening of pretax and restructuring charges of pretax 
these charges were also the primary contributors to the net loss incurred in compared to net income of in segment results in the following sections of md a  we discuss the results from operations of each of our reportable segments 
safeco s management measures segment profit or loss for its property casualty businesses primarily based upon safeco form k 
table of contents underwriting results 
underwriting results profit or loss represent the net amount of earned premium less underwriting losses and expenses on a pretax basis 
management views underwriting results as a critical measure to assess the effectiveness of the underwriting of the property casualty operations and to evaluate the results of these business units 
the related investment portfolio is managed separately from these underwriting businesses and  accordingly  net investment income and net realized investment gains and losses are discussed separately 
life investments results are evaluated based on pretax operating earnings  which excludes net realized investment gains and losses and unusual or non recurring events or transactions 
management believes the presentation of segment pretax operating earnings enhances the understanding of our results of operations by highlighting earnings attributable to the normal  recurring operations of the business 
underwriting results and segment pretax operating earnings are not a substitute for net income determined in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap

the growth in pif and premiums in was impacted by three strategic initiatives the introduction of our new auto insurance product  the new business entry model using point of sale technology pos and increased commissions on new business effective january  the new auto insurance product contains additional underwriting tiers to provide both more refined price points based on risk and to make insurance available to a broader range of drivers 
this new auto product has been introduced in states through december  and is expected to be available in all states where we currently write business by the end of this new product also expands the use of automated underwriting techniques  which use multiple variants to classify auto insurance risks into tiers 
in early  we also implemented improved pos technology in our agents offices  making it easier for them to write business with safeco 
this technology allows agents to quote policies more quickly and makes it easier for our agents to sell safeco products 
our new commission structure increased commissions on new auto policies significantly for the first six month policy period and revised the bonus commission structure to align our bonus incentives to agents with both our growth and profitability goals 
the increased premiums in resulted from the rate increases described above  which were partially offset by a pif decrease in the decrease in pif reflected decreasing retentions during driven by the tightening of underwriting standards and the cancellation of contracts with agencies producing unprofitable business 
our underwriting loss of improved over our underwriting loss of  which improved over our underwriting loss of in our improved underwriting results in both and reflect the growth in premium rates and our expanded use of automated underwriting techniques which  along with stricter underwriting standards  resulted in better matching of rates with risk 
the improvements in our underwriting results also contributed to our improved combined ratio and particularly the loss ratio component 
our loss ratio steadily improved to in from in and in the loss ratio improvement continued throughout reflecting the underwriting actions described above  particularly the average rate increases and the new insurance scoring model 
the loss ratio improvements were partially offset by increased lae resulting from increased training costs for claims personnel and higher underwriting expenses resulting from the increased commissions previously described 
the pos technology initiative  new product introduction  rate increases  stricter underwriting standards and increased agent commissions on new auto business are all expected to continue to contribute to improved profitability and policy growth in this line of business 
personal insurance homeowners year ended december net earned premiums underwriting loss combined ratio safeco form k 
table of contents net earned premiums increased or in to  compared to net earned premiums of in  which was an increase of over the increase in net earned premiums in reflects the efforts in and to significantly increase average renewal premiums in order to reduce losses in this product line 
average homeowners rates increased  and in  and  respectively  and we expect comparable increases for the impact of increasing rates was largely offset by a decrease of in pif at december  in comparison to a year ago due to tightening of underwriting standards 
the tightening of underwriting standards and higher rates decreased new business production  although we experienced stable retention rates in comparison to the prior year 
net earned premiums increased slightly during as rate increases began to take hold 
homeowners pif remained stable in compared to the increased earned premiums in and reflect the continued execution of the strategy implemented in for the turnaround of homeowners 
this strategy includes raising prices and reducing monoline homeowners commissions to improve underwriting results 
we also will continue to decrease the amount of homeowners insurance written in states where we cannot achieve profitability 
currently  we have moratoriums on writing new business in ten states 
moratoriums will be lifted in these states as we secure approval to implement changes to move this product toward profitability 
in addition  safeco is introducing new language into homeowners policies sold in storm prone midwest states  which requires individuals to pay a deductible of percent of their home s value before insurance coverage on repair costs for wind and hail damage 
we are also in the process of filing limits on mold damages to  or  including remediation  in all states where limits on mold coverage are allowed 
in the first quarter of  we launched a new tiered pricing structure for homeowners that more accurately prices business based on risk characteristics

new business production was up approximately for while retentions improved marginally during the year

sbi regular is introducing a redesigned business model to support sales growth  deliver pricing more accurately matched to risk characteristics and improve customer service 
the suite of services being introduced includes an automated underwriting platform  a business service center and a new business agency interface system 
the underwriting platform and service center were launched during the first and second quarters of and the new business agency interface module was launched in the fourth quarter of the new underwriting approach provides an increased number of pricing tiers and better matching of rate to risk

our underwriting loss of improved over our underwriting loss of in  which compared to an underwriting loss of in similarly  the combined ratio improved to in  compared to in and in the improvement in underwriting loss and combined ratio during was due to the underwriting actions described above and the impact of reserve strengthening of in the third quarter of  as well as lower claim costs from catastrophe and weather losses

on january   we entered into a settlement with jp morgan to end the litigation involving these bonds 
the terms of the settlement did not result in a material change to our net recorded loss  and we do not anticipate incurring any further charges related to this loss 
the underwriting profit was impacted by the enron loss and the underwriting profit in was impacted by higher contract and commercial bond losses in the second half of the year  due in part to the slowing national economy

net earned premiums remained consistent in all three years increasing in to  compared to net earned premiums of in  which was an increase from in our underwriting loss of improved over our underwriting loss of  which compared to an underwriting loss of in in the third quarter of safeco decided to put its london operations into runoff  resulting in a charge of pretax in the quarter 
this charge primarily reflects reserve strengthening to provide for emerging losses as the business is run off 
the underwriting loss includes third quarter reserve strengthening of described earlier related to construction defect and asbestos and environmental loss development  as well as in losses from the september  attacks  net of reinsurance  which primarily related to losses in the lloyds of london operations 
impact of terrorism we have estimated our pretax losses net of reinsurance resulting from the september  terrorist attacks at  of which is attributable to reinsurance written through rf bailey  a wholly owned foreign subsidiary that participated in the lloyds of london underwriting market  to our business insurance accounts  and to life investments 
effective january   our reinsurers stopped providing terrorism coverage in our commercial property and casualty reinsurance treaties 
the loss of reinsurance coverage for terrorism was immediate with respect to new business and has affected renewal business as the policies come up for renewal 
consequently  terrorism coverage in our reinsurance protection is limited to certain commercial property risks that have obtained facultative reinsurance which includes coverage for terrorism  personal lines losses covered under our property catastrophe treaty or high value home treaty  and coverage for certain terrorism acts under our surety excess of loss treaty 
for its direct writings in up until november   safeco adopted the commercial property and casualty terrorism exclusion developed and filed for approval by the insurance services office iso 
this exclusion was absolute with respect to losses from terrorism arising from biological  chemical or nuclear hazards 
with respect to non biological  non chemical and non nuclear losses from terrorism  the exclusions only applied if the total losses safeco form k 
table of contents from a terrorist event exceeded in addition  for casualty policies  the exclusion applied if the terrorist event involved the deaths or serious injury to or more persons 
the property exclusion did not apply to losses arising from fire following a terrorist event in the states that follow the standard fire policy form 
this exclusion applied to both domestic and foreign terrorist events 
on november   the federal government enacted the terrorism risk insurance act of tria 
it requires mandatory offers of terrorism coverage to all commercial policyholders  including workers compensation and surety policyholders 
tria does not apply to life or personal lines policyholders 
in the event of a terrorism attack on behalf of a foreign interest resulting in insurance industry losses of or greater  the us government will provide funding to the insurance industry on an annual aggregate basis of of covered losses in excess of individual insurance company deductibles up to billion 
the deductible is a percentage of each individual company s direct earned premium and the percentage increases in each of the three calendar years covered by tria 
in  safeco s deductible is estimated to be upon enactment of tria  our existing terrorism exclusions were void to the extent that they excluded losses from foreign terrorist events as defined in tria 
however  the exclusions remained effective as to acts of domestic terrorism 
iso has filed exclusions for acts of terrorism as defined in tria 
safeco is adopting these exclusions in all states that have accepted the filings and will use the exclusions if a policyholder rejects the mandatory offer of terrorism coverage 
some states may object to or limit the use of terrorism exclusions 
tria also requires that insurance companies notify in force commercial policyholders by february  that coverage is now provided and the cost for that coverage 
safeco sent out required notices by that due date 
as a consequence of tria and safeco s response  safeco s reinsurers are providing limited options to purchase reinsurance for terrorism events 
safeco is considering these options 
in the meantime  due to the current unavailability of the iso exclusion for safeco s commercial property casualty policies in a few states  safeco will continue to be exposed to commercial losses that arise from terrorism without reinsurance for such losses 
we also have no reinsurance for terrorism related losses in our workers compensation line 
with regard to commercial lines policies  safeco s focus is on the small to medium account business 
our customers are generally not viewed as potential terrorism targets 
for workers compensation the number of employees covered is considered and coverage is declined in cases where the exposure is potentially severe 
safeco s exposure to personal lines losses is currently believed to be relatively modest due to small individual exposure and wide spread of risk 
safeco believes its terrorism exposure is relatively modest across all product lines 
property casualty loss and lae reserves the following table analyzes the changes in property casualty loss and lae reserves for  and changes in estimated reserves are reflected in the income statement in the year the change is made

table of contents quarter 
the increase of included related to estimates of workers compensation losses 
we reevaluate our estimates of workers compensation loss severity quarterly  with particular focus on the expected future rate of medical inflation 
over the course of the year  actual medical inflation proved to be higher than anticipated and we adjusted our estimated reserves accordingly 
while loss severities for construction defect claims appear to be mitigating  the legal costs associated with achieving reduced loss costs were higher than estimated  resulting in a reserve increase of asbestos claims related to our participation in pools and syndicates were higher than estimated  resulting in a reserve increase of the increase in other reserves related primarily to safeco s london operations 
safeco placed its london operations in runoff in the third quarter of due to the high layer excess nature of some of the coverages provided by this operation  and the long reporting lag  management strengthened reserves to provide for higher than anticipated losses as the business is run off 
in  safeco increased its estimates for loss and lae related to prior years by during the third quarter of  safeco completed a review of its property casualty loss reserve adequacy 
as a result of this review  which included an independent actuarial study  we increased reserves by this reserve addition related to property casualty operating segments as follows for sbi and for p c other 
the p c other segment includes the discontinued reinsurance operation that safeco acquired when it purchased american states in the reserve addition related to recent developments in prior year losses as follows for workers compensation  for construction defect and for other coverages  primarily asbestos and environmental 
workers compensation reserves were at december  the reserve strengthening in the third quarter of of was due to unexpected development of prior year losses and continued increases in medical costs that manifested in beyond levels previously anticipated in estimating workers compensation reserves 
throughout  average workers compensation case reserves carried by safeco were stable  but increased in the first quarter of compared to the first quarter of and increased in the second quarter of compared to the second quarter of these increases reflected the impact of rising medical costs and administrative rulings that had been more favorable to plaintiffs claims for compensation  particularly in california and florida 
in general  workers compensation claims are largely comprised of medical costs and salary wage payments while claimants are out of work 
the payout period for these claims can be up to years or more 
accordingly  the estimation of long term medical costs requires considerable judgment and involves inherent uncertainty  having a significant impact on our estimate of workers compensation reserves 
in light of these emerging trends of rising medical costs and recent administrative rulings  we strengthened reserves by the estimation of liabilities related to construction defect and asbestos and environmental claims is subject to greater subjectivity than for other claims 
construction defect reserves were at december  in early  safeco s construction defect claims appeared to have peaked and were trending down through the rest of such claims were predominantly in california 
however  in the first two quarters of  newly reported claims increased significantly  owing largely to increased attorney involvement in california and increased claim activity into additional states 
as a result of these considerations  management concluded that ultimate losses for construction defect will likely be higher than previously estimated  leading to our assessment in the third quarter of to increase reserves by asbestos and environmental reserves were at december   for asbestos and for environmental 
the increase in reserves in the p c other segment relates to the anticipated increase in asbestos claims relating primarily to the discontinued reinsurance operations acquired in the american states purchase 
in  the insurance industry was experiencing a trend of expansion of asbestos defendants to include smaller and more peripheral firms such as installers  in addition to asbestos manufacturers and producers and safeco was receiving more claims in the first half of than in prior years 
because these trends were expected to ultimately impact the losses assumed by safeco  and because safeco expected a lag in its asbestos activity due to its assumed reinsurance exposure  reserves were strengthened by in addition to the reserve change in estimate discussed above  reserve estimates were increased at other points throughout the year by an additional  primarily for workers compensation reserves due to continued rising medical costs 
in  estimates for property casualty prior year loss and lae reserves were increased by  of which related to construction defect claims as safeco saw reported claim volumes that  while trending down in the safeco form k 
table of contents latter part of  exceeded expectations 
workers compensation estimates were increased and commercial automobile estimates were increased  both in reaction to claim severities 
safeco regularly monitors loss frequency and loss severity relative to expectations 
when emerging frequency or severity differs materially from expectations  projections for future frequency and severity are re evaluated and estimates are increased  or decreased  accordingly 
the remaining change in estimate in came from a combination of lines of business including commercial automobile  commercial multiperil  general liability and homeowners 
each change was a reaction to emerging loss frequency or severity relative to expected loss frequency or severity 
the change for any one line represented a small percentage of the line s reserves 
property casualty reinsurance we use treaty and facultative reinsurance in managing our exposure to potential losses for property casualty operations 
as noted previously  the liability for unpaid losses and lae is reported gross of reinsurance recoverables of at december  and at december  before allowance for uncollectible reinsurance 
because the amount of the ultimate reinsurance recoverables depends on the amounts of individual losses or  in some cases  the aggregate amount of all losses by year in a particular line of business  the exact amount of the reinsurance recoverables is not known until losses are settled 
therefore  we estimate the amount of reinsurance recoverables we anticipate receiving based on the terms of the underlying reinsurance contracts  historical reinsurance recovery experience and our estimates of related loss and lae reserves 
the availability and cost of reinsurance is subject to prevailing market conditions  both in terms of price and available capacity 
although the reinsurer is liable to safeco to the extent of the reinsurance ceded  we remain primarily liable to the policyholders as the direct insurer on all risks insured 
the magnitude of losses in the reinsurance industry resulting from the september  terrorist attacks has impacted the financial strength of certain reinsurers which may result in collectibility or recoverability issues 
however  to safeco s knowledge  none of our major reinsurers is currently experiencing material financial difficulties 
at december   the estimated allowance for uncollectible reinsurance was safeco s business is not substantially dependent upon any single reinsurance account 
of the total property casualty reinsurance recoverables balance at december   was with mandatory reinsurance pools and foreign reinsurers 
approximately of the remaining amounts due are from reinsurers rated a or higher by a

safeco credit generated after tax profits for the seven months ended july  of and for capital resources and liquidity sources and uses of funds safeco s operations have liquidity requirements that vary among our segments and principal product lines 
life insurance  retirement services and annuity product reserves are primarily longer duration liabilities that are typically predictable in nature and are supported by investments that are generally longer duration 
property casualty liabilities vary in duration according to the product and coverages provided 
these liabilities are less predictable in nature and generally require greater liquidity in the investment portfolio 
safeco s liquidity needs are met by dividends from our subsidiary operations  the sale and maturity of invested assets and external borrowings 
our subsidiaries primary sources of cash from operations are insurance premiums  funds received under deposit contracts  dividends  interest and asset management fees 
safeco has not engaged in the sale by securitization of any investments or other assets 
safeco form k 
table of contents safeco s liquidity needs are being met and the successful achievement of our profitability goals will continue to enhance our liquidity position  conversely  an inability to sustain adequate profitability may adversely affect our capital resources and liquidity position 
safeco uses funds to support operations  service and pay down debt  pay dividends to safeco shareholders and grow the investment portfolio 
cash from insurance operations is used primarily to pay claims and claim adjustment expenses 
most insurance premiums are received before or at the time premium revenues are recognized  while related claims are incurred and paid in subsequent months or years 
catastrophe claims  the timing and amount of which are inherently unpredictable  may create increased liquidity requirements 
in order to better match invested asset duration to the duration of related liabilities  during we repositioned our property casualty investment portfolio to reduce the bond investment portfolio duration from approximately to approximately as of december   the bond investment portfolio s duration was the property casualty asset allocation mix also has been adjusted to reduce volatility  by lowering the exposure to equity securities 
equity securities comprised approximately of this investment portfolio at december  compared to approximately at december  as a result of executing this strategy  this portfolio s allocation to taxable bonds has increased relative to its tax exempt holdings 
as a result  pretax investment income in for the property casualty investment portfolio increased compared to  while after tax investment income declined in compared to total cash provided by operating activities for  and was  and  respectively see consolidated statements of cash flows for additional information 
the main reasons for the improved operating cash flow in compared to were lower property casualty claims payments  due to lower catastrophe and weather losses  as well as the effect of our re underwriting efforts and rate increases that began in after tax investment income declined in and is expected to be modestly lower in due to lower interest rates available for investment of new cash flows and maturing investments  as well as changes in safeco s investment strategy as discussed above 
the higher level of proceeds from the sale of fixed maturities and equities and the higher level of purchases of fixed maturities in compared to were due to the portfolio repositioning discussed above 
in addition  the relatively high level of proceeds from the maturity of fixed maturities in all three years reflects the high number of calls of fixed maturities and prepayments of mortgage backed securities 
these calls and prepayments were due to the lower interest rate environment during the past three years and issuer driven actions 
the high level of purchase and sale activity related to fixed maturities available for sale in was also due in part to shifting a portion of property casualty s bond holdings from tax exempt to taxable bonds 
the reason for this shift was to maximize the portfolio s after tax return in view of the higher level of underwriting losses in and the resulting alternative minimum tax 
the high level of proceeds from equity securities in is mainly due to approximately of planned equity securities sales out of property casualty s investment portfolio 
the proceeds from these equity securities sales were reinvested in taxable fixed income securities 
these sales resulted in increased net realized investment gains from equity securities in funds received under deposit contracts relate primarily to annuity  retirement services and individual products of life investments 
of the total billion in deposit contracts at december   approximately are structured settlement immediate annuity products 
these annuities have an average expected maturity of over years at issuance and cannot be surrendered by policyholders 
equity indexed annuities eia  comprising or approximately of total deposit contracts at december   have associated surrender charges ranging from in year one to after year six 
during  and  life investments has offered to waive surrender charges on several different occasions in order to induce eia policyholders to surrender their contracts 
these offers resulted in a reduction of the eia principal policy account balance of  and in  and  respectively 
these surrenders contributed to the return of funds held under deposit contracts in  and see consolidated statements of cash flows for more information 
other annuity and retirement services products comprise of total deposit contracts 
these products generally have expected maturities of to years at issuance and associated surrender charges ranging from to in year one reduced to within to years 
life investments retains the option to defer payouts over years on approximately of these contracts 
universal life products comprise of total deposit contracts 
of the total universal life product deposit contracts  are boli policies which have expected maturities of to years at issuance with surrender charges varying according to policy type

the gics within the retirement services area comprise the remaining of total deposit contracts 
safeco issued of medium term notes on march  at  which mature on march  in conjunction with this debt issuance  we entered into interest rate swap agreements 
the swaps are for notional amounts totaling and replace the fixed rates of the medium term notes with variable rates at basis points over the day libor rate 
the swaps also mature in march on august   we issued of senior notes with a coupon of that mature in the majority of the proceeds of the notes were used for the repayment of of commercial paper borrowings  for the termination of related interest rate swaps and for repayment of medium term notes 
the remaining balance has been used for general corporate purposes 
safeco simultaneously entered into a notional interest rate swap to effectively convert the fixed rate senior note obligation into a libor based floating rate obligation 
the fair value of the interest rate swap is marked to market on the balance sheet and included in other invested assets with the corresponding offsetting asset or liability included in the face value of the debt 
safeco renewed its bank credit facility in september with available through september this replaced the facility that expired in september the reduction in this bank credit facility is consistent with the elimination of safeco s commercial paper program in august safeco pays a fee to have the facility available and does not maintain deposits as compensating balances 
similar to its previous facility  the new facility carries certain covenants that require safeco to maintain a specified minimum level of shareholders equity and a maximum debt to capitalization ratio 
there were no borrowings under either facility as of december  and and safeco was in compliance with all covenants 
on november   safeco completed the sale of  shares of common stock at per share 
safeco received proceeds net of related expenses of from the sale of these shares 
the net proceeds were used to contribute capital of to our property casualty operations and to our life investments operations in december to support future growth in our core product lines and strengthen the capital base of these operations 
remaining proceeds will be used for general corporate purposes and may include the repayment or repurchase of outstanding indebtedness 
on january   safeco issued of senior notes with a coupon of that mature in and of senior notes with a coupon of that mature in the notes are unsecured and rank equally with all our other unsecured senior indebtedness 
the proceeds from the notes will be used to repay principal amount of notes due march  and to call up to principal amount of notes maturing in with a call date at par of april  the following tables summarize safeco s contractual obligations  as of december  payments due by contractual obligations total less than year years years more than years long term debt and capital securities operating leases total contractual obligations as discussed above  the in proceeds from the senior notes issued in january will be used to repay long term debt due or callable in material terms of contractual obligations are described in notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
ratings the financial strength of insurers is rated to provide both insurance consumers and industry participants with comparative information on specific insurance companies 
financial strength ratings are important for the marketing of our products and some lines are especially sensitive to ratings such as structured settlement safeco form k 
table of contents annuities  boli products and gics 
higher ratings generally indicate greater financial strength and a stronger ability to pay claims 
lower ratings for us could  among other things  significantly affect our ability to sell certain life insurance and investment products  materially increase the number of policy surrenders and withdrawals by policyholders of cash value from their policies  adversely affect relationships with broker dealers  banks  agents and other distributors of our products and services  adversely affect new sales  significantly affect borrowing costs or limit our access to capital  and adversely affect our ability to compete 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  consolidated results of operations and financial condition 
ratings focus on factors such as results of operations  capital resources  debt to capital ratio  demonstrated management expertise in the insurance business  marketing  investment operations  minimum policyholders surplus requirements and capital sufficiency to meet projected growth  as well as access to such capital as may be necessary to continue to meet standards for capital adequacy 
due primarily to our poor property casualty underwriting results in and  our financial strength and corporate credit ratings were lowered in the first half of the lower operating results in and  combined with increased operating leverage in property casualty  contributed to lower debt service coverage for safeco 
in addition  the interest rates on short term borrowings increased due to the ratings downgrades 
currently  all rating agencies maintain a stable outlook on their ratings of safeco 
on august   standard poor s s p affirmed its ratings on safeco corporation and our property casualty subsidiaries 
at the same time  s p lowered its ratings on our life insurance subsidiaries because of a change in s p group methodology criteria  which modified the rating provided to subsidiaries 
the new criteria generally limits the rating given to a subsidiary that s p deems strategically important to the parent to within one notch of the rating on the parent s core group 
on december   am best reaffirmed safeco s ratings and revised its outlook for our corporate and property casualty ratings from negative to stable 
we believe our financial position is sound and continue to execute our action plans to improve property casualty s operating results 
the effect of our operating action plans has been reflected in improved operating results and this has improved safeco s debt service coverage during it is  however  possible that further negative ratings actions may occur 
lower ratings have significantly affected life investments ability to sell structured settlement immediate annuities and boli products 
if ratings are further lowered  safeco may incur higher borrowing costs  may have more limited means to access capital  and may have additional difficulties marketing certain of its insurance products that are dependent upon ratings being at or above a particular level

limitations or prohibitions on the use of insurance scoring  which is partially based on personal credit information  could adversely affect property casualty s business plans  depending on the specifics of any such limitation or prohibition 
those states in which safeco s insurance subsidiaries are domiciled or deemed to be commercially domiciled  limit the amount of dividend payments that can be made by those subsidiaries without prior regulatory approval 
these limitations are not anticipated to limit our insurance subsidiaries from paying dividends to safeco corporation in safeco form k 
table of contents in amounts sufficient to fund our shareholder dividends and service debt 
based on the statutory limits as of december   safeco is able to receive approximately in dividends from its insurance subsidiaries in without obtaining prior regulatory approval 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic uses risk based capital rbc formulas for both life insurers and property and casualty insurers 
these serve as an early warning tool by the naic and state regulators to identify companies that are undercapitalized and merit further regulatory attention or the initiation of regulatory action 
safeco s life and property and casualty companies have more than sufficient capital to meet the rbc requirements 
effective january   our insurance subsidiaries adopted the naic s revised accounting practices and procedures manual and the domiciliary states of our insurance subsidiaries have adopted the provisions of the revised manual 
the revised manual has changed  to some extent  prescribed statutory accounting practices and resulted in changes to the accounting practices that our insurance subsidiaries use to prepare their statutory basis financial statements 
our property casualty insurance companies statutory surplus increased by and the life investments insurance companies by upon the january  adoption 
nearly all of these increases in statutory surplus related to the recording of deferred tax assets that was not recorded in the statutory basis financial statements under the prior statutory accounting guidance 
under washington state s insurance code  investments in foreign securities are not considered admitted assets for statutory accounting purposes 
however  statutory accounting practices prescribed by the naic allow insurance companies to account for foreign investments as admitted assets 
the washington state insurance commissioner has the express statutory authority to permit an insurer to make investments not otherwise eligible under the state s insurance code and has exercised this authority by permitting safeco to account for its foreign investments as admitted assets 
the property casualty insurance subsidiaries hold investments in foreign corporations and municipalities of and at december  and  respectively  and the life investments insurance subsidiaries hold investments in foreign corporations and municipalities of and at december  and  respectively 
these amounts increase the surplus of our insurance subsidiaries accordingly 
income taxes as of december   safeco had approximately  of gross deferred tax assets  including net operating loss carryforwards of that expire in and although realization of deferred tax assets is not assured  we believe it is more likely than not that the deferred assets will be realized through future earnings  including but not limited to the generation of future operating income and reversal of existing temporary differences and available tax planning strategies 
accordingly  no valuation allowance has been recorded 
in preparing estimates of future taxable income  we have used the assumptions and projections utilized in our internal financial projections 
these projections of future profitable results are subject to uncertainties primarily related to the variability of property casualty underwriting results 
should results not be as profitable as we have forecasted the establishment of a valuation allowance may be required 
any such allowance would impact current operating results 
investment summary investment activities are an integral part of our business and investment income is a significant component of our total revenues 
our investment philosophy is to emphasize investment yield balanced with investment quality  and to provide for liquidity  diversification and a reasonable matching of expected asset and liability durations 
we are subject to the risk that our investments may decline in value and bond defaults may occur 
net investment income safeco s consolidated pretax net investment income increased to  during from  in and  in the investment portfolios of property casualty and life investments produced substantially all of this investment income 
our consolidated pretax net investment income increased slightly in over  primarily due to improved cash flows in property casualty  a repositioning of the property casualty investment portfolio as discussed below  and a higher invested asset base in life investments  offset in safeco form k 
table of contents part by lower pretax yields on fixed maturity investments due to lower interest rates

although property casualty operating cash flow was positive in all three years  the higher level of claims payments in and and the high amount of dividends paid to the parent company in  combined with the declining interest rate environment and bond call activity  dampened investment income 
after tax investment income in also declined due to the portfolio repositioning  discussed below 
after tax investment income in is expected to be slightly lower due to low interest rates and the property casualty portfolio repositioning 
property casualty paid dividends to the parent company totaling  and for  and  respectively 
these dividends declined in due to underwriting losses 
in order to better match invested asset duration to the duration of related liabilities  during we repositioned our property casualty investment portfolio to reduce the bond investment portfolio duration from approximately to approximately as of december   the bond investment portfolio s duration was compared to at december  and at december  the property casualty asset allocation mix was also adjusted to reduce volatility  by lowering the exposure to equity securities 
equity securities comprised approximately of this investment portfolio at december  compared to approximately at december  as a result of executing this strategy  this portfolio s allocation to taxable bonds has increased relative to its tax exempt holdings 
as a result  pretax investment income for the property casualty investment portfolio increased in compared to while after tax investment income declined in compared to life investments pretax net investment income was   and  in  and  respectively 
the growth in investment income in compared to was due primarily to the higher invested assets related to the growth of total funds held under deposit contracts  partially offset by lower pretax yields on new investments and loss of interest income due to bond defaults

the determination of whether a decline is other than temporary is made based on the relevant facts and circumstances related to the security 
these considerations include the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  including any specific events that influence the operations of the issuer or that affect its future earnings potential  our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for a recovery in value  a review of any downgrades of the security by a rating agency  and any reduction or elimination of dividends or non payment of scheduled interest payments 
determining what constitutes an other than temporary decline involves judgment 
declines in fair value below cost not considered other than temporary in the current period could be considered other than temporary in a future period and reduce earnings to the extent of the impairment

included in the fixed maturity securities carrying amount were gross unrealized losses of and gross unrealized gains of  included in the equity securities carrying amount were gross unrealized losses of and gross unrealized gains of industries that contributed more than of the total gross unrealized loss were electric utilities and airlines 
as of december   unrealized losses on securities that were in an unrealized loss position for longer than a year amounted to for equity securities and for fixed maturity securities 
these unrealized losses represent less than of total portfolio value and are attributed to a prolonged period of distressed credit markets experienced in both and we continue to monitor these securities as part of our overall portfolio evaluation and if an unrealized loss is determined to be other than temporary  the impairment loss would be recognized in the current period when that determination is made 
the impairments of in were comprised of for fixed maturity securities and for equity securities 
the increases in impairments in and were due to credit deterioration and corporate failures of several issuers  particularly in the retail  airline and telecommunications sectors 
additional impairments are possible in due to the continued weak economy  however  the timing and amount of any further impairments are not currently estimable

in addition to market risk  safeco is exposed to other risks  including the credit risk related to its financial instruments and the underlying insurance risk related to its core businesses 
the sensitivity analysis above summarizes only the exposure to market risk related to recorded financial assets and liabilities 
safeco manages its market risk by matching the projected cash inflows of assets with the projected cash outflows of liabilities of its investment and financial products eg  annuities  retirement services products 
for all of its financial assets and liabilities  safeco seeks to maintain reasonable average durations  consistent with the maximization of income without sacrificing investment quality and providing for liquidity and diversification 
safeco uses certain derivative financial instruments to increase its matching of cash flows 
for example  s p call option contracts and futures are purchased to hedge the liability of life investments eia products 
the estimated fair values at the adjusted market rates assuming a basis point increase in market interest rates are calculated using discounted cash flow analysis and duration modeling  where appropriate 
the estimated values do not consider the effect that changing interest rates could have on prepayment activity eg  cmos and annuities 
this sensitivity analysis provides only a limited  point in time view of the market risk sensitivity of certain of safeco s financial instruments 
the actual impact of market interest rate and price changes on the financial instruments may differ significantly from those shown in the sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis is further limited as it does not consider any actions safeco could take in response to actual and or anticipated changes in safeco form k 
table of contents interest rates and equity prices 
as allowed under the guidance for these disclosures  certain financial instruments eg  policy loans are not required to be included in the sensitivity analysis 
in addition  certain non financial instruments eg  insurance liabilities are excluded from the sensitivity analysis 
accordingly  any aggregation of the estimated fair value amounts or adjusted fair value amounts would not represent the underlying fair value of net equity
