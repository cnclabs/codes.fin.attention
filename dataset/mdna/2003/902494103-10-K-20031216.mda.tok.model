recently issued accounting standards in january  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
the interpretation 
the interpretation requires the consolidation of variable interest entities in which an enterprise absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of the entity s expected residual returns  or both  as a result of ownership  contractual or other financial interests in the entity 
currently  entities are generally consolidated by an enterprise that has a controlling financial interest through ownership of a majority voting interest in the entity 
the interpretation was originally effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january   and effective in the fourth quarter of the company s fiscal for those created prior to february  however  in october  the fasb deferred the effective date for those variable interest entities created prior to february   until the company s first quarter of fiscal the company has substantially completed the process of evaluating the interpretation and believes its adoption will not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 amendment of statement no 
on derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 

sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide clarification on the financial accounting and reporting of derivative instruments and hedging activities and requires that contracts with similar characteristics be accounted for on a comparable basis 
the standard is effective for contracts entered into or modified after june   and for hedging relationships designated after june  the company s adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no

did not have a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
critical accounting estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the following is a summary of certain accounting estimates considered critical by the company 
financial instruments the company uses derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to various market risks  including certain livestock  natural gas  interest rates and grain and feed costs 
the company may hold positions as economic hedges for which hedge accounting is not applied 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s 
contingent liabilities the company is subject to lawsuits  investigations and other claims related to wage and hour labor  cattle procurement  securities  environmental  product and other matters  and is required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies are made after considerable analysis of each individual issue 
these reserves may change in the future due to changes in the company s assumptions  the effectiveness of strategies or other factors beyond the company s control 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
accrued self insurance insurance expense for casualty claims and employee related health care benefits are estimated using historical experience and actuarial estimates 
the assumptions used to arrive at periodic expenses are reviewed regularly by management 
however  actual expenses could differ from these estimates and could result in adjustments to be recognized 
impairment of long lived assets the company is required to assess potential impairments to its long lived assets  which are primarily property  plant and equipment 
if impairment indicators are present  the company must measure the fair value of the assets in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of disposal of long lived assets  to determine if adjustments are to be recorded 
goodwill and intangible asset impairment in assessing the recoverability of the company s goodwill and other intangible assets  management must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges not previously recorded 
on september   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  and was required to assess its goodwill for impairment issues upon adoption  and then at least annually thereafter 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk s market risk market risks relating to the company s operations result primarily from changes in commodity prices  interest rates and foreign exchange rates as well as credit risk concentrations 
to address certain of these risks  the company enters into various derivative transactions as described below 
if a derivative instrument is a hedge  as defined by sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities sfas no 
 as amended  depending on the nature of the hedge  changes in the fair value of the instrument will be either offset against the change in fair value of the hedged assets  liabilities or firm commitments through earnings  or recognized in other comprehensive income loss until the hedged item is recognized in earnings 
the ineffective portion of an instrument s change in fair value  as defined by sfas no 
 as amended  will be immediately recognized in earnings as a component of cost of sales 
instruments that do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting are marked to fair value with unrealized gains or losses reported currently in earnings 
additionally  the company holds certain positions  primarily in grain and livestock futures and options  for which it does not apply hedge accounting  but instead marks these positions to fair value through earnings at each reporting date 
the sensitivity analyses presented below are the measures of potential losses of fair value resulting from hypothetical changes in market prices related to commodities and hypothetical changes in exchange rates related to interest rates 
sensitivity analyses do not consider the actions management may take to mitigate the company s exposure to changes  nor do they consider the effects that such hypothetical adverse changes may have on overall economic activity 
actual changes in market prices may differ from hypothetical changes 
commodities risk the company is a purchaser of certain commodities  such as corn  soybeans  livestock and natural gas in the course of normal operations 
the company uses commodity futures and options for hedging purposes to reduce the effect of changing prices and as a mechanism to procure the underlying commodity 
generally  contract terms of a hedge instrument closely mirror those of the hedged item providing a high degree of risk reduction and correlation 
contracts that are highly effective at meeting this risk reduction and correlation criteria are recorded using hedge accounting 
the following table presents a sensitivity analysis resulting from a hypothetical change of in market prices as of september   and september   respectively  on fair value of open positions 
the fair value of such positions is a summation of the fair values calculated for each commodity by valuing each net position at quoted futures prices 
the market risk exposure analysis includes hedge and non hedge positions 
the underlying commodities hedged have a correlation to price changes of the derivative positions such that the values of the commodities hedged based on differences between commitment prices and market prices and the value of the derivative positions used to hedge these commodity obligations are inversely correlated 
the following sensitivity analysis reflects an inverse impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions for livestock and natural gas and a direct impact on earnings for changes in the fair value of open positions for grain 
effect of change in fair value in millions livestock cattle hogs grain natural gas interest rate risk the company has exposure to changes in interest rates on its fixed rate  long term debt 
market risk for fixed rate  long term debt is estimated as the potential increase in fair value  resulting from a hypothetical decrease in interest rates  and amounts to approximately million at september  the fair values of the company s long term debt were estimated based upon quoted market prices and or published interest rates 
the company hedges exposure to changes in interest rates on certain of its financial instruments 
under the terms of various leveraged equipment loans  the company enters into interest rate swap agreements to effectively lock in a fixed interest rate for these borrowings 
the maturity dates of these leveraged equipment loans range from to with interest rates ranging from to 
because of the positions taken with respect to these swap agreements  an increase in interest rates would have a minimal effect on the fair value for fiscal years and foreign currency risk the company also periodically enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to hedge some of its foreign currency exposure 
the company enters into forward contracts to hedge exposure to us currency fluctuations inherent in its receivables and purchase commitments 
there were no such contracts outstanding at september   and the fair value of forward contracts at september   was not significant 
foreign forward contracts generally have maturities or expirations not exceeding months 
a change in the exchange rate of the currencies hedged at september   would have changed the fair value of the contracts by million 
concentrations of credit risk the company s financial instruments that are exposed to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of cash equivalents and trade receivables 
the company s cash equivalents are in high quality securities placed with major banks and financial institutions 
concentrations of credit risk with respect to receivables are limited due to the large number of customers and their dispersion across geographic areas 
the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers financial condition and generally does not require collateral 
at september   approximately of the company s net accounts receivable balance was due from one customer 
no other single customer or customer group represents greater than of net accounts receivable
