critical accounting policies the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  commonly referred to as gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of critical accounting policies 
a summary of our accounting policies and procedures is included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
management believes the following are the critical accounting policies used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
real estate assets impairment assessment we periodically assess our real estate assets for possible permanent impairment when certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of real estate may not be recoverable 
management considers current market conditions and tenant credit analysis in determining whether the recoverability of the carrying amount of an asset should be assessed 
when an assessment is warranted  management determines if it is probable that the sum of the expected undiscounted future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the property being assessed 
if the undiscounted future cash flows are less than the carrying amount  then an impairment loss would be recognized equal to the amount of the difference between the fair value of the property and its carrying amount 
real estate assets estimated useful lives and allocation of purchase price we depreciate our real estate assets using the straight line method over their estimated useful lives 
our buildings and improvements are currently being depreciated over to years 
the useful lives of the properties are assigned based on the third party appraisals and or structural reviews that are prepared for each property we acquire 
the purchase price of our properties is allocated to land and building in accordance wih the respective appraised values 
derivatives we have used and may continue to use interest rate swap arrangements to minimize interest rate risk 
we do not enter into interest rate swap arrangements for trading purposes 
swaps we have entered into with third parties  were documented as cash flow hedges and designated as highly effective at inception of the swap agreements  therefore  in accordance with gaap  the unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the swaps at their fair value is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the swaps is recorded as either a derivative instrument asset or a derivative instrument liability on our consolidated balance sheets 
we intend to meet the conditions for hedge accounting  however  if a particular interest rate swap does not qualify as highly effective  the change in the fair value of the derivatives used as hedges would be reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
rental revenue recognition we lease our real estate pursuant to long term  triple net leases  under which the tenants typically pay all operating expenses of a property  including  but not limited to  all real estate taxes  assessments and other government charges  insurance  utilities  repairs and maintenance 
all leases are accounted for as operating leases 
rental income attributable to the leases is recorded monthly when due from tenants and is recognized on a straight line basis over the initial terms of the related leases 
rental income attributable to the majority of our leases is fixed by the lease agreement 
however  under our variable rate lease program  monthly base rent is calculated based on a spread over an applicable index  typically libor 
the vast majority of our variable rate lease agreements contain minimum lease rates and fixed rate conversion features  and none of these leases contains a maximum rate 
our leases typically provide for upward periodic adjustments in base rent due from our tenants  usually based on a factor of the change in the consumer price index  commonly referred to as cpi 
certain of our leases also provide for fixed minimum and or maximum periodic adjustments during the initial lease term  generally based on a fixed percentage of the base rent 
we straight line the fixed minimum escalator rental income over the initial lease term 
any rent adjustments above the fixed minimum escalators are recorded as revenue in the period they are due from the tenants 
capitalized leasing costs certain initial direct costs incurred by us in negotiating and consummating a successful lease are capitalized and generally amortized over the initial base term of the lease 
capitalized leasing costs include employee compensation and payroll related fringe benefits directly related to time spent performing leasing related activities 
these activities include evaluating the prospective tenant s financial condition  evaluating and recording guarantees  collateral and other security arrangements  negotiating lease terms  preparing lease documents and closing the transaction 
results of operations comparison of to revenue rental 
rental revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio  the timing of our property acquisitions and whether or not our leases have fixed minimum escalators  from which we generate our rental income 
we owned properties as of december   versus properties as of december   although three of the properties owned as of december  were sold during and reclassified from rental revenue to discontinued operations as discussed under discontinued operations below  throughout  we converted the leases on approximately million of properties leased to several tenants from variable rate to fixed rate  resulting in an increase in rental revenue 
other terms of the leases  including lease escalators  remained unchanged  and an increase from rent adjustments above the fixed minimum escalators  which are recorded as revenue in the period they are due from tenants 
the increase in rental revenue was partially offset by the following at the end of the third quarter of  we converted the leases relating to million of properties leased to a tenant from fixed rate to variable rate with a minimum lease rate  resulting in a decrease in rental revenue 
we also converted the interest rate on approximately million of debt that is secured primarily by the properties subject to these leases from fixed rate to variable rate 
other terms of the leases  including lease escalators  remained unchanged  a decrease in lease rates on our variable rate leases 
as of december   approximately million of our nearly billion real estate portfolio  or  was subject to variable rate leases 
this compares to million  of which million is related to the three properties sold during  of our billion real estate portfolio  or  that was subject to variable rate leases as of december  under our variable rate lease program  rental income attributable to our leases is variable  and monthly base rent is calculated based on a spread over an applicable index  typically libor 
the decrease in lease rates is due to a decrease in the underlying indices during the previous year 
the vast majority of our variable rate lease agreements contain minimum lease rates  which have partially mitigated the decrease in lease rates  and none of these leases contains a maximum rate 
in addition  the vast majority of our variable rate lease agreements contain fixed rate conversion features 
we had a corresponding decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt resulting in reduced interest expense  which is more fully described below 
interest and other 
interest and other income for the year ended december  increased to  from  for the increase was primarily due to an increase in interest earned on temporary investments and escrows and other fee income  partially offset by a gain on the sale of properties  totaling  included in interest and other income for the year ended december  beginning in  gaap requires that the gains and losses from the dispositions of properties and all operating earnings from these properties be reported as discontinued operations 
this requires reclassification of certain amounts from income from continuing operations to discontinued operations which is more fully described below 
expenses depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization for the year ended december  increased to million from million for and consisted primarily of depreciation on buildings and improvements owned during those years 
the increase is attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio  resulting in an increase in our depreciable assets 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for included in our expenses  is a write off totaling  related to the remaining costs on our former office space 
in october  we took advantage of the soft office space market and locked up a long term lease for more efficient space and relocated our office 
in addition  we subleased our former space to a third party 
in accordance with gaap  the remaining costs related to a pre existing lease should be charged to expense when the leased property has no substantive future use or benefit to the lessee  net of any rent received from subleasing to a third party 
general and administrative expenses  excluding this write off  increased from excluding the former office space write off  the increase in operating expenses from the prior year is due primarily to an increase in payroll and related expenses primarily attributable to an increase in base compensation  the award of additional stock based compensation to employees  an increase in bonuses awarded to employees for performance  as well as an increase in the number of employees  an increase in office administration expenses as a result of an increase in staffing requirements and costs associated with the relocation of our office  an increase in information technology costs for several projects initiated and completed during related to the expansion of our hardware infrastructure to improve security  reliability and capacity  an increase in directors and officers insurance due to an increase in market rates  the purchase of errors and omissions insurance which our servicing entity is required to maintain as a condition to servicing the debt securitization that closed on june   an increase in state income taxes due to the growth of our real estate portfolio during and this increase was more than offset by a  credit recorded during the third quarter of relating to the reimbursement of business and occupancy taxes by certain of our tenants  an increase in costs associated with our public reporting requirements due to an increase in the number of shareholders  an increase in legal fees associated with our compliance with certain provisions of the sarbanes oxley act of  proposed and final rules promulgated by the sec thereunder and proposed nasdaq corporate governance reforms  and an increase in fees associated with servicing our growing portfolio 
modification of debt 
on june   we issued million in four classes of triple net lease mortgage notes  series  which we refer to as the notes  as further described in liquidity and capital resources mortgage debt and revolving credit facilities below 
the transaction reflects approximately million of new debt issued in classes under current market terms and a restructuring of a securitization completed in that had a remaining balance of approximately million  which we refer to as the modified debt 
the certificates representing the modified debt have economic terms equivalent to the prior transaction 
because the terms of the modified debt were virtually identical to the original debt  it did not result in a significant modification of debt for gaap purposes 
therefore  in accordance with gaap  third party costs totaling  incurred in connection with the modified debt were expensed during the second quarter of there were no such expenses incurred during the year ended december  interest 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for since december   our overall debt increased from approximately million consisting of approximately million of fixed rate and approximately million of variable rate debt to approximately billion consisting of approximately million of fixed rate and approximately million of variable rate debt as of december   which debt was primarily obtained to directly or indirectly finance the acquisition of properties during the year 
although our overall debt had increased since december   our interest expense did not increase proportionately due to the mix of variable rate debt to total debt and the reduction of interest rates during the year 
the effective interest rate on our debt  which includes deferred loan fees amortized over the life of the loans  decreased from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  the decreases were partially offset by the conversion of million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt during the first quarter of through the execution of interest rate swap arrangements with a third party 
the interest rate swap arrangements were executed in conjunction with our conversion of the leases on approximately million of properties leased to a tenant from variable rate to fixed rate  the conversion of million of variable rate debt to fixed rate debt during the fourth quarter of we entered into an interest rate swap arrangement with a third party during the third quarter of to swap this variable rate debt to fixed rate 
the swap became effective in november of  and the issuance of approximately million of fixed rate debt on june   of which a portion was used to pay down borrowings on our short term credit facilities  as noted in liquidity and capital resources mortgage debt and revolving credit facilities below 
discontinued operations beginning in  statement of financial accounting standards  commonly referred to as sfas  no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that gains and losses from dispositions of properties and all operating earnings from these properties be reported as discontinued operations 
this also requires that all past earnings applicable to a property disposed of on or after january  be reported as discontinued operations 
as a result  previously reported income from continuing operations will be updated each time a property is sold 
this requirement is for presentation only and has no impact on net income 
during the third quarter of  we sold three properties and received net proceeds of million resulting in a combined gain of  the earnings generated from these properties have been reported as discontinued operations in accordance with sfas no 
and are presented net of minority interest 
revenue from the sold properties not including the gain on the sale of the properties for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
total income from discontinued operations for the years ended december  and was  and  respectively 
extraordinary item extinguishment of debt during the third quarter of  we amended million of fixed rate debt due september  to convert the debt to variable rate debt 
the debt was converted in conjunction with the conversion of leases relating to million of property from fixed rate to variable rate as discussed above 
the conversion of the interest rate on the debt from fixed to variable resulted in a significant modification of the debt 
in accordance with gaap  we wrote off the remaining deferred loan fees relating to the debt and classified the write off as an extraordinary item on our consolidated statements of operations 
the extraordinary item totaled  or per basic and diluted share  during the year ended december  we did not have any extraordinary items during the year ended december  comparison of to revenue rental 
rental revenue for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the increase was primarily attributable to the growth of our real estate portfolio  the timing of our property acquisitions and whether or not our leases have fixed minimum escalators  from which we generate our rental income 
we owned properties as of december   versus properties as of december  although three of the properties owned as of december  and were sold during and reclassified from rental revenue to discontinued operations as discussed under discontinued operations below 
the increase in rental revenue was partially offset by a decrease in lease rates on our variable rate leases 
as of december   million  of which million is related to the three properties sold during  of our billion real estate portfolio  or  was subject to variable rate leases 
this compares to million of our billion real estate portfolio  or  that was subject to variable rate leases as of december  we had a corresponding decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt resulting in reduced interest expense  which is more fully described below 
under our variable rate lease program  rental income attributable to the leases is variable  and monthly base rent is calculated based on a spread over an applicable index  typically libor 
of the total variable rate leases  the majority of the lease agreements contain minimum lease rates and fixed rate conversion features  and none of such leases contains a maximum rate 
of the total amount of variable rate lease additions during  approximately million related to properties leased to sonic that were converted from fixed rate to variable rate during the third quarter of and the remaining million was from acquisitions completed during the year 
we also converted the interest rate on the underlying debt that is secured primarily by such properties from fixed rate to variable rate as discussed below 
interest and other 
interest and other income for the year ended december  decreased to  from million for the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in interest earned on temporary investments as well as a decrease in the gain on the sale of properties  which decreased to  from  in expenses depreciation and amortization

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses for the year ended december  increased to million  as compared to million for the increase in operating expenses from the prior year is due primarily to an increase in payroll and related expenses primarily attributable to the issuance of additional stock based compensation awarded to employees  an increase in bonuses awarded  as well as an increase in the number of employees  an increase in state income taxes due to the growth of our real estate portfolio during and  and additional costs associated with our marketing and investor relations program 
the increase from prior year was partially offset by a decrease in professional services and travel costs and a  write down during the third quarter of of our investment in a start up  on line procurement solution company for the automotive retail industry 
the investment was written off because they ceased operations due to their inability to secure the capital necessary to fund their business 
interest 
interest expense for the year ended december  increased to million from million for the increase was due to an increase in debt outstanding during that time period including mortgage debt and borrowings under our credit facilities  which was obtained primarily to fund acquisitions 
as discussed above  the increase was partially offset by a decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
our variable rate debt totaled million as of december  including million of variable rate debt that will become fixed rate debt effective july  pursuant to an interest rate swap arrangement  which was subsequently extended to november  
the effective interest rate on our debt  which includes deferred loan fees amortized over the life of the loans  decreased from in to in debt outstanding as of december  was approximately million consisting of approximately million of fixed rate and approximately million of variable rate debt compared to million consisting of approximately million of fixed rate and approximately million of variable rate debt as of december  discontinued operations see results of operations comparison of to for a description of the reporting of discontinued operations

extraordinary item extinguishment of debt during the third quarter of  we amended million of fixed rate debt due september  to convert the debt to variable rate debt 
the debt was converted in conjunction with our conversion from fixed rate to variable rate leases relating to approximately million of property which sonic leases  as discussed above 
the new debt terms require monthly payments including interest and principal  and provide for interest at the day libor rate plus basis points versus a fixed rate of 
the conversion of the interest rate on the debt from fixed to variable resulted in a significant modification of the debt 
in accordance with gaap  the significant modification should be treated as an extinguishment of debt 
as a result  we wrote off the remaining deferred loan fees related to the fixed rate debt and classified the write off as an extraordinary item on our consolidated statements of operations 
the extraordinary item totaled  or per basic and diluted share  during the year ended december  we did not have any extraordinary items during the year ended december  liquidity and capital resources cash and cash equivalents were million and million at december  and december   respectively 
the changes in cash and cash equivalents during the years ended december  and were attributable to operating  investing and financing activities  as described below 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  and represents  in each year  cash received primarily from rents under long term  triple net leases  plus interest and other income  less normal recurring general and administrative expenses and interest payments on debt outstanding 
investing activities cash used in investing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively  and primarily reflects the acquisition of dealership properties  facility improvements and construction fundings  net of sales  during those years 
financing activities cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  primarily reflects million of proceeds received from borrowings on our revolving credit facilities  million of proceeds received from mortgage debt incurred during the year  and million of proceeds received from the issuance of common shares  net of costs 
the cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayment of borrowings on our revolving credit facilities totaling million  distributions made to shareholders and minority partners during the year totaling million  payments of principal on outstanding mortgage debt totaling million  the increase of restricted cash totaling million  payments for debt issuance costs totaling million  payments made during the first quarter of totaling million and  to purchase outstanding warrants to purchase common shares during the fourth quarter of and first quarter of  respectively  and the redemption of units totaling  cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  primarily reflects million of proceeds received from borrowings on our revolving credit facilities  million of proceeds received from mortgage debt incurred during the year  million of proceeds received from our follow on offering  net of costs  and million of proceeds received from the issuance of other common shares  net of costs 
the cash provided by financing activities was partially offset by the repayment of borrowings on our revolving credit facilities totaling million  distributions made to shareholders and minority partners during the year totaling million  payments of principal on outstanding mortgage debt totaling million  payments made to purchase outstanding warrants to purchase common shares totaling million  the redemption of units totaling million  the increase of restricted cash totaling  payments for debt issuance costs totaling  and the repurchase of common shares pursuant to our common share repurchase program totaling  financing strategy to minimize interest rate risk  we typically match the average term of our long term debt with the average remaining term of our leases as well as the type of debt with the type of leases fixed or variable rate in order to maintain an investment spread over the lease term 
we describe this process as match funding 
we currently intend to match fund at least of our total outstanding long term debt with long term leases 
we may change the guideline at any time without shareholder approval 
as of december   approximately of our debt outstanding was substantially match funded  non recourse debt 
as of december   our long term debt had a weighted average remaining term of years  and our leases had a weighted average remaining term of years 
we have adopted a policy to limit debt to approximately of our assets calculated as total assets plus accumulated depreciation 
this policy may be changed by our board of trustees at any time without shareholder approval 
as of december   our debt to assets ratio was approximately and our debt to total market capitalization was approximately 
in light of our current financial position  we believe that we will be able to obtain additional financing for our short term and long term liquidity requirements as discussed in liquidity requirements below 
we have used and may continue to use interest rate swap arrangements to minimize interest rate risk and to match fund our long term debt with our long term leases 
however  there can be no assurance that additional financing or capital will be available  or that the terms will be acceptable or advantageous to us 
variable rate lease program we may offer our current and prospective tenants the option of utilizing our variable rate lease program 
under this program  base rent changes monthly based upon a spread over an applicable index  typically libor 
in addition  the monthly base rent is typically adjusted upward periodically  usually based on a factor of the change in the cpi 
as of december   approximately million of our nearly billion real estate portfolio  or  was subject to variable rate leases 
the vast majority of our variable rate lease agreements contain minimum lease rates and fixed rate conversion features  and none of these leases contains a maximum rate 
upon conversion  the fixed base rent typically continues to be adjusted upward periodically based on a factor of the change in the cpi or other escalation provisions set forth in the lease 
we believe the existing mix of variable rate leases and variable rate debt maintains our balance sheet flexibility  while continuing our policy of minimizing interest rate risk

the loan requires interest only payments until the conversion date  and quarterly interest and principal payments until maturity once converted 
upon conversion  the interest rate will be at a spread over either the lender s commercial fixed rate or floating rate  at our option 
this loan is secured by one property  which as of december  had a net book value of approximately million 
this loan was converted from fixed rate to variable rate during the third quarter of following the conversion  the loan bears interest equal to the day libor rate plus basis points and requires monthly level payments of principal and interest with a final payment at maturity of approximately million 
the loan is secured by of our properties  which as of december  have an aggregate net book value of approximately million 
these loans bear interest at variable rates ranging from to basis points above the a p commercial paper rate or the day libor rate and have maturity dates ranging from december  to may  the terms of the various loans require either quarterly interest payments and level principal payments or monthly level payments of principal and interest until maturity  at which time the loans require final payments totaling approximately million 
excluding million of the variable rate debt  the loans are secured by properties  which as of december  have an aggregate net book value of approximately million 
the remaining million of the variable rate debt is secured by the same properties that secure the loan discussed in footnote 
amounts borrowed under this facility bear interest at market rates determined at the time of each draw until such time as we and the lender set an interest rate for any future amounts borrowed under the facility 
as of december   the borrowings under the facility bear interest equal to the day libor rate plus basis points 
the facility requires the repayment of principal within days 
borrowings outstanding as of december  require repayment between may  and may  the facility has a one year term  which terminates on march   and is renewable annually 
at the end of the first quarter of  we closed on this million unsecured revolving credit facility 
the facility replaced the existing million secured revolving credit facility at the end of the second quarter of the facility provides for a three year term with interest equal to either the prime rate less basis points or the one month  two month or three month libor rate plus basis points and requires the repayment of borrowings within days 
borrowings outstanding as of december  require repayment by april  as of december   the borrowings under the facility bear interest equal to the three month libor rate plus basis points 
these borrowings were subsequently converted to bear interest equal to the one month libor rate plus basis points effective january  the facility matured on march   and was extended until the end of the second quarter at which time it was replaced by the new unsecured revolving credit facility 
the more significant debt covenants related to our mortgage debt and credit facilities limit the company s debt to assets ratio and require the company to comply with minimum debt service coverage and maximum debt to adjusted net worth ratios 
several of our loan agreements contain no financial covenants  however  there are negative covenants relating to customary items such as operation and maintenance of the properties securing the loans and limitations on issuing additional secured debt at those subsidiary levels 
as of december   we were in compliance with all of the debt covenants related to our mortgage debt and credit facilities 
million debt securitization as noted in footnote of the debt table herein  we modified approximately million of debt during the second quarter of because the terms of the modified debt were virtually identical to the original debt  the modification did not result in a significant modification of debt under gaap 
therefore the unamortized issuance costs related to the original debt of million  plus million of costs related to the modified debt that was paid to the lender and capitalized  will be amortized over the remaining term of the modified debt using the effective interest method  and third party costs totaling  incurred in connection with the modified debt were expensed 
in addition  we incurred approximately million in debt issuance costs associated with the issuance of the new notes  which were capitalized and will be amortized over the term of the new notes using the effective interest method 
interest rate swaps in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this statement was originally effective for all fiscal quarters of fiscal years beginning after june   however  during the second quarter of the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities deferral of the effective date of fasb statement no 
 which deferred the effective date until june  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities  an amendment to sfas no 
 which required that all companies be in compliance with sfas no 
as of january  sfas no 
does not require restatement of financial statements from prior periods 
sfas no 
requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as either assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure those instruments at fair value 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  there was no impact to our financial statements at the time of adoption 
during the third quarter of  we borrowed million of long term variable rate debt drawn under a million commitment for secured financing from toyota financial services 
the terms of the debt provide for a year term with interest at a spread over the one month libor rate 
on november   pursuant to an agreement with a third party  the variable rate swapped to a fixed rate 
during the first quarter of  we converted the leases on approximately million of properties leased to a tenant from variable rate to fixed rate 
at the same time  we entered into interest rate swap arrangements with a third party to fix the interest rate on the debt secured primarily by such properties totaling approximately million 
fixing the rate on million of debt with interest rate swap arrangements  continues our strategy of minimizing interest rate risk by substantially match funding our debt with leases in order to lock in our investment spread over the initial lease term 
these swaps were designed to mirror the underlying variable rate debt in terms of index  spread  reset  amortization  compounding and maturity 
due to the identical nature of the terms of the swap arrangements and the underlying terms of the debt  we determined that these derivative instruments are highly effective 
consequently  in accordance with gaap  the unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the swaps at their fair value is recorded as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss within shareholders equity on our consolidated balance sheets 
the fair value of the swaps is recorded as either a derivative instrument asset or derivative instrument liability and is included in other assets or other liabilities and accumulated other comprehensive income loss within our consolidated balance sheets 
in addition  we are required to post collateral  generally in the amount of the swap valuations at any point in time  to protect the lenders in case of an early termination by us 
the collateral posted by us  totaling approximately million and zero as of december  and  respectively  is included in other assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
the unrealized gain loss as of december  and was as follows in thousands as of december  derivative instrument asset liability extraordinary item extinguishment of debt as noted in footnote of the debt table herein  the interest rate on million of debt was converted from fixed rate to variable rate during the third quarter of the conversion of the interest rate on the debt from fixed to variable resulted in a significant modification of the debt 
in accordance with gaap  the significant modification should be treated as an extinguishment of debt 
as a result  we wrote off the remaining deferred loan fees relating to the fixed rate debt and classified the write off as an extraordinary item on the consolidated statements of operations 
the extraordinary item totaled  or per basic and diluted share  during the year ended december  liquidity requirements short term liquidity requirements consist primarily of normal recurring operating expenses and capital expenditures  regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional and replacement debt  distributions to shareholders and holders of units  who we refer to as unitholders  and amounts required for additional property acquisitions  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings 
we expect to meet these requirements other than amounts required for additional property acquisitions  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings through cash provided from operations and our existing revolving credit facilities 
our short term liquidity requirements also include the repayment of short term debt totaling approximately million  which includes a million balloon payment of our fixed rate mortgage debt due april   an million repayment of our outstanding short term variable rate mortgage debt due april   if this debt is not converted  at our option  into a five year term note  a million repayment of borrowings outstanding on our short term unsecured credit facility due april   and a million repayment of borrowings outstanding on our short term secured credit facility due between may  and may  all discussed in mortgage debt and revolving credit facilities above 
we anticipate repayment of our short term debt with the net proceeds received from a debt securitization  which is expected to close at the end of the first quarter of if we do not complete a debt securitization  we will be required to either use alternative financing sources for repayment or request extensions to the maturity dates of the mortgage debt and credit facilities described above 
the availability and terms of any such financing will depend upon market and other conditions 
we anticipate that any additional acquisitions of properties  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings during the next months will be funded with the debt securitization as discussed above  amounts available under our existing long term debt commitments  future long term secured and unsecured debt and the issuance of common or preferred equity or units  each of which may be initially funded with our existing revolving credit facilities 
acquisitions of properties  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings will be made subject to our investment objectives and policies with the intention of maximizing both current and long term growth and income 
as of december   long term liquidity requirements consisted primarily of maturities under our long term debt 
we anticipate that long term liquidity requirements will also include amounts required for acquisitions of properties  facility improvement and expansion fundings and construction financings 
we expect to meet long term liquidity requirements through long term secured and unsecured borrowings and other debt and equity financing alternatives 
the availability and terms of any such financing will depend upon market and other conditions 
aggregate annual principal maturities of mortgage debt which includes principal amortization and excludes the short term variable rate mortgage debt totaling approximately million which matures april  that is convertible  at our option  into a five year term note as of december  are as follows in thousands for the year ended december  thereafter total during the second quarter of  we received a commitment for million of secured long term variable rate financing from toyota financial services 
the commitment can be drawn down in multiple fundings under one or more debt instruments  and each funding is subject to customary conditions precedent and the lender s satisfaction with the loan documentation 
the terms of the commitment provide for a year term with interest at a spread over the one month libor rate 
as of december   we had million available under this commitment 
common share repurchase program during  we announced that our board of trustees had authorized the repurchase of up to million common shares 
purchases have been and will be made from time to time in open market transactions at prevailing prices or in negotiated private transactions at the discretion of management 
during  there were no repurchases of common shares 
during  we repurchased  common shares at an average price of per common share 
during  we repurchased  common shares at an average price of per common share 
from the inception of the common share repurchase program through december   a total of  common shares have been repurchased at an average price of per common share 
in conjunction with the common share repurchases  the partnership redeemed an equivalent number of units from the company for equivalent purchase prices 
dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan during april  the company implemented a dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan  which was subsequently amended in march  which we refer to as the drip 
under the drip  current shareholders and unitholders are permitted to elect to reinvest all  a portion or none of their cash dividends or distributions to purchase common shares 
the drip also allows both new investors and existing shareholders and unitholders to make optional cash payments to purchase common shares 
the drip permits current shareholders  unitholders and new investors to invest a minimum of up to a maximum of  in common shares per month 
the drip also allows us to raise additional capital by waiving the limitations on the  maximum per month  as more fully described in the prospectus relating to the drip 
shares purchased under the drip through reinvestment of dividends are purchased at a discount currently 
shares purchased under the drip through optional cash payments of  or less are purchased at market price 
common shares may be purchased directly from the company or in open market or privately negotiated transactions  as we determine from time to time  to fulfill the requirements for the drip 
we issued approximately   and  common shares under the drip and received approximately  million and million in proceeds for the years ended december   and  respectively 
purchase of warrants outstanding to purchase common shares during the fourth quarter of  we completed the purchase of outstanding warrants to purchase approximately million common shares for per warrant 
the aggregate purchase price for the warrants was approximately million  of which million was paid in and the remaining million was paid in  and was funded with debt and cash on hand 
during the first quarter of  we completed the purchase of outstanding warrants to purchase  common shares for per warrant  which was funded with cash on hand 
the purchase price for all the warrants was based on the time remaining prior to exercise and the intrinsic value meaning the difference between the fair market value of the common shares and the exercise price of the warrants of the outstanding warrants at the time of the offer to purchase 
the exercise price per share for the common shares underlying the warrants was and substantially all warrants would have expired in february the purchase of the warrants was considered a retirement of an equity instrument for gaap purposes and therefore recorded as a charge to shareholders equity 
in addition  a total of  and  warrants to purchase common shares were exercised at per share during and  respectively 
as of december   we had warrants outstanding to acquire a total of  common shares at an exercise price of per share with expiration dates ending no later than february funds from operations the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit developed funds from operations  commonly referred to as ffo  as a relative non gaap financial measure of performance and liquidity of an equity reit in order to recognize that income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
ffo  as defined under the revised definition adopted in april by nareit  is income loss from continuing operations before minority interest and extraordinary item computed in accordance with gaap plus income from discontinued operations including minority interest and excluding gains or losses from the sales of property reported as income loss from continuing operations plus depreciation and amortization of assets unique to the real estate industry  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
adjusted ffo  which we refer to as affo  is ffo less straight lined rents 
ffo does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income and should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance or to cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to make distributions 
we consider ffo and affo meaningful  additional measures of operating performance because they primarily exclude the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  and because industry analysts have accepted them as performance measures 
comparison of our presentation of ffo  using the nareit definition  and affo  to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 
the following chart reconciles ffo and affo for each of the five years in the period ended december  to their most directly comparable gaap measure  income from continuing operations before minority interest and extraordinary item in thousands  except share data income from continuing operations before minority interest and extraordinary item real estate depreciation and amortization income from discontinued operations  net of minority interest minority interest related to income from discontinued operations gain on sale of assets ffo less straight lined rents affo weighted average number of common shares and units used to compute basic ffo and affo per share weighted average number of common shares and units used to compute fully diluted ffo and affo per share item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to certain financial market risks  the most predominant being fluctuations in interest rates 
interest rate fluctuations are monitored by our management as an integral part of our overall risk management program  which recognizes the unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to reduce the potentially adverse effect on our results of operations 
in general  our policy of substantially match funding at least of our long term debt with long term leases reduces our exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
as of december   approximately of our debt outstanding was substantially match funded  non recourse debt 
we have used and may continue to use interest rate swap arrangements to minimize interest rate risk and to match fund our long term debt with our long term leases 
we do not enter into interest rate swap arrangements for trading purposes 
during the year ended december   our fixed rate debt increased from million as of december  to million as of december  interest rate fluctuations may affect the fair value of our fixed rate debt instruments 
if interest rates on our fixed rate debt instruments at december  had been one percentage point higher or lower  the fair value of those debt instruments on that date would have decreased or increased  respectively  by approximately million 
during the year ended december   our variable rate debt increased from million as of december  including the million of variable rate that became fixed rate debt effective november  under an interest rate swap arrangement to million as of december  in addition  our real estate investments which are leased by tenants utilizing our variable lease rate program increased from million as of december  to million as of december  interest rate fluctuations may affect our annual interest expense on our variable rate debt 
if interest rates on our variable rate debt instruments outstanding at december  had been higher or lower  our annual interest expense relating to those debt instruments would have increased or decreased  respectively  by approximately million  based on balances at december  the impact on net income as a result of an increase or decrease in interest rates by is partially reduced by the structure of our variable rate leases 
interest rate fluctuations may affect our annual rental revenue on our variable rate leases  because the lease rates on the base rents on our variable rate leases are based on a spread over an applicable index  typically libor 
as of december   under the vast majority of our variable rate lease agreements  the minimum lease rates  the majority ranging from to  were in effect 
these minimum lease rates are designed to ensure minimum rental revenues if interest rates decline 
if the underlying index on our variable rate lease agreements outstanding at december  had been higher or lower  our annual rental revenue relating to those lease agreements would have increased by approximately  or decreased by approximately  respectively 
assuming the underlying index increased or decreased to a level where none of our minimum lease rates were triggered  a increase or decrease in the underlying index would increase our rental revenues by approximately to million or decrease our rental revenue by approximately to million
