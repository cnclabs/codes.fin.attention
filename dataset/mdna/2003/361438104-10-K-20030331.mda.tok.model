item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the notes thereto included in item to this report 
background basis of presentation gabelli asset management inc the company  incorporated in april  had no significant assets or liabilities and did not engage in any substantial business activities prior to the public offering offering of its shares 
on february   the company exchanged million shares of its class b common stock  representing all of its then issued and outstanding common stock  to gabelli funds  inc gfi and two of its subsidiaries in consideration for substantially all of the operating assets and liabilities of gfi related to its institutional and retail asset management  mutual fund advisory  underwriting and brokerage business the reorganization 
gfi was subsequently renamed gabelli group capital partners  inc ggcp 
immediately following the reorganization  the company sold million shares of its class a common stock in an initial public offering 
on february  the offering was completed and the company received proceeds  net of fees and expenses  of approximately million 
following the offering  gfi owned of the outstanding common stock of the company 
for periods after the offering  the company s financial statements will reflect the financial condition and results of operations of gabelli asset management inc and the historical results of gfi will be shown as predecessor financial statements 
overview the company s revenues are largely based on the level of assets under management in its businesses as well as the level of fees associated with its various investment products 
growth in revenues generally depends on the general level and trends of the stock market  good investment performance  which influences assets under management by increasing the value of existing assets under management  contributing to higher investment and lower redemption rates and facilitating the ability to attract additional investors while maintaining current fee levels 
growth in assets under management is also dependent on being able to access various distribution channels  which is usually based on several factors  including performance and service 
historically  the company depended primarily on direct distribution of its products and services  but since has participated in third party distribution programs  including ntf programs 
a majority of the company s cash inflows to mutual fund products have come through these channels since in recent years the company has been engaged to act as a sub advisor for other much larger financial services companies with much larger sales distribution organizations 
a substantial portion of the cash flows into our institutional and separate accounts business has come through this channel 
fluctuations in financial markets also have a substantial effect on assets under management and results of operations  although the company s extensive use of variable compensation programs tends to moderate the effects of fluctuations in revenues 
the company s largest source of revenues is investment advisory fees  which are based on the amount and composition of assets under management in its mutual funds and separate accounts 
advisory fees from the mutual funds and sub advisory accounts are computed daily or weekly  while advisory fees from the separate accounts and certain alternative investment products are generally computed quarterly based on account values as of the end of the preceding quarter 
these revenues vary depending upon the level of sales compared with redemptions  financial market conditions and the fee structure for assets under management 
revenues derived from the equity oriented portfolios generally have higher management fee rates than fixed income portfolios 
revenues from our alternative investment products generally include an incentive allocation of of the economic profit  as defined 
the incentive allocation is recorded as earned with the related compensation expense accrued 
the incentive allocation fees and related compensation expense may increase or decrease during the year depending upon the performance of the underlying alternative investment products 
at the end of the year a final accounting is prepared by product and payment is received 
we receive fulcrum fees from certain separate accounts based upon meeting or exceeding certain contractual investment return thresholds over a stipulated period of time 
performance fees are finalized and received when the contract period is completed 
certain fees in our closed end funds are only earned if the funds total return is greater than a specified total return 
a total of million of assets in closed end funds are subject to such arrangements 
commission revenues consist of brokerage commissions derived from securities transactions executed on an agency basis on behalf of mutual funds  institutional and high net worth clients as well as investment banking revenue  which consists of underwriting profits  selling concessions and management fees associated with underwriting activities 
commission revenues vary directly with account trading activity and new account generation 
investment banking revenues are directly impacted by the overall market conditions  which affect the number of public offerings which may take place 
distribution fees and other income primarily include distribution fees payable in accordance with rule b b of the investment company act of  as amended the investment company act  along with sales charges and underwriting fees associated with the sale of the mutual funds plus other revenues 
distribution fees fluctuate based on the level of assets under management and the amount and type of mutual funds sold directly by the company and through various distribution channels 
compensation costs include variable and fixed compensation and related expenses paid to the officers  portfolio managers  sales  trading  research and all other staff members of the company 
other operating expenses include product distribution and promotion costs  clearing charges and fees for the company s brokerage operation  rental of office space and electronic data equipment and services  insurance  client servicing and other general and administrative operating costs 
interest and dividend income  interest expense and net gain loss from investments which includes both realized and unrealized gains is derived from proprietary investments of the company s capital in various public and private investments 
prior to the date of the reorganization  net gain loss from investments was derived primarily from the assets that were distributed to gfi and also included the results of gfi s hedging activities 
as part of an overall hedge of the risks associated with gfi s proprietary investment portfolio  gfi entered into transactions in domestic equity index contracts 
these financial instruments represented future commitments to sell an underlying index for specified amounts at specified future dates 
in connection with the formation transactions  the company distributed most of the proprietary investment portfolio which included the hedging activities to gfi 
as a result of the offering  the company became taxable as a c corporation for federal and state income tax purposes and paid taxes at an effective rate considerably higher than when gabelli asset management inc and certain of its subsidiaries were treated as subchapter s corporations 
minority interest represents the share of net income attributable to the minority stockholders  as reported on a separate company basis  of the company s consolidated majority owned subsidiaries

nearly of assets managed by the company are in equity products 
average assets managed  and therefore investment advisory fees  continued to be impacted by the overall decline in the world equity markets during equity markets were down for a third straight year as the standard poor s  russell and nasdaq indices fell  and  respectively 
against this backdrop  assets managed in our open end equity mutual funds declined to billion in  from billion in substantially all of this billion decline was due to market performance as equity mutual fund cash outflows were less than billion in the decline in equity managed assets was largely offset by an increase in assets managed in our fixed income products 
the result of lower equity valuations and a shift in mix to lower margin fixed income products led to a decline in mutual fund revenues of  or million  to million in from million in investment advisory fees from our institutional and high net worth separate accounts rose million to million in compared to million in  benefiting from nearly million in net new cash flows into its equity portfolios during the year 
advisory fees from alternative investment products increased to million from million in due to higher overall levels of assets under management

operating results for the year ended december  as compared to the year ended december  total revenues for the year ended december  were million versus million for the year ended december  assets under management ended the year at billion  a increase over prior year end assets under management of billion 
the growth in assets under management of billion in was driven by net new cash flows of billion  which was partially offset by the overall decline in equity market valuations 
investment advisory and incentive fees  which comprised of total revenues in  were million  million or below the comparable revenues of million 
the increase in advisory fees for our institutional and high net worth separate accounts and alternative investment accounts were more than offset by lower mutual fund revenues and incentive performance fees from alternative investment products 
revenues from institutional and high net worth separate accounts rose or million as assets under management in these accounts grew to billion in versus billion in net cash flows into separate accounts for were billion 
although mutual fund assets under management remained virtually unchanged  at billion at december  versus billion at december   revenues declined million or due to lower average assets under management in our open end equity funds and resulting shift in product mix from higher fee equity products to fixed income products 
the average assets under management in the open end equity mutual funds were billion in  lower than the prior year average of billion 
net cash flows into mutual funds were billion during  including million into equity products 
the positive cash flows into equity products in were offset by a decline of billion in equity market valuations which impacted the overall revenue mix 
revenues from alternative investment products benefited from a increase in assets under management which increased advisory fees million in over the prior year 
the increase in managed assets was primarily the result of net cash inflows for the year as overall market performance in was flat 
performance fees  as a result  were million or lower in versus the prior year 
commission revenues in were million  a decrease of million  or  from commission revenues of million in the lower commission revenues result from a decline in agency trading activity for accounts managed by affiliated companies

liquidity and capital resources the company s principal assets consist of cash  short term investments  securities held for investment purposes and investments in partnerships in which the company is either a general or limited partner 
short term investments are comprised primarily of united states treasury securities with maturities of less than one year and money market funds managed by the company 
although investments in investment partnerships are for the most part illiquid  the underlying investments of such partnerships are for the most part liquid and the valuations of the investment partnerships reflect that underlying liquidity 
summary cash flow data is as follows in thousands cash flows provided by used in operating activities    investing activities   financing activities    increase decrease in cash and cash equivalents    cash and cash equivalents at beginning of year    cash and cash equivalents at end of year    cash and liquidity requirements have historically been met through operating income and the company s borrowing capacity

the letter of credit expires on august  cash and securities held in the collateral account are restricted from other uses until the letter of credit expires

we believe that our ability to maintain our investment grade rating will provide greater access to the capital markets  enhance liquidity and lower overall borrowing costs 
gabelli company is registered with the commission as a broker dealer and is a member of the nasd 
as such  it is subject to the minimum net capital requirements promulgated by the commission 
gabelli company s net capital has historically exceeded these minimum requirements 
gabelli company computes its net capital under the alternative method permitted by the commission  which requires minimum net capital of  as of december  and  gabelli company had net capital  as defined  of approximately million and million  respectively  exceeding the regulatory requirement by approximately million and million  respectively 
regulatory net capital requirements increase when gabelli company is involved in underwriting activities 
market risk equity price risk the company is subject to potential losses from certain market risks as a result of absolute and relative price movements in financial instruments due to changes in interest rates  equity prices and other factors 
the company s exposure to market risk is directly related to its role as financial intermediary and advisor for assets under management in its mutual funds  institutional and separate accounts business and its proprietary investment and trading activities 
at december   the company s primary market risk exposure was for changes in equity prices and interest rates 
at december  and  the company had equity investments  including mutual funds largely invested in equity products  of million and million  respectively 
investments in mutual funds  million and million at december  and  respectively  generally lower market risk through the diversification of financial instruments within their portfolios 
in addition  the company may alter its investment holdings from time to time in response to changes in market risks and other factors considered appropriate by management 
the company also holds investments in partnerships and affiliates which invest primarily in equity securities and which are subject to changes in equity prices 
investments in partnerships and affiliates totaled million and million at december  and  respectively  of which million and million were invested in partnerships and affiliates which invest in event driven merger arbitrage strategies 
these strategies are primarily dependent upon deal closure rather than the overall market environment 
the following table provides a sensitivity analysis for our investments in equity securities and partnerships which invest primarily in equity securities excluding arbitrage products  for which the principal exposure is to deal closure and not overall market conditions  as of december  and the sensitivity analysis assumes a increase or decrease in the value of these investments 
in thousands fair value assuming fair value assuming decrease in increase in fair value equity prices equity prices at december  equity price sensitive investments  at fair value    at december  equity price sensitive investments  at fair value    the company s revenues are largely driven by the market value of its assets under management and are therefore exposed to fluctuations in market prices of these assets  which are largely readily marketable equity securities 
investment advisory fees for mutual funds are based on average daily or weekly asset values 
management fees earned on institutional and separate accounts  for any given quarter  are determined based on asset values on the last day of the preceding quarter 
any significant increases or decreases in market value of assets managed which occur on the last day of the quarter will result in a relative increase or decrease in revenues for the following quarter 
interest rate risk the company s exposure to interest rate risk results  principally  from its investment of excess cash in government obligations 
these investments are primarily short term in nature and the fair value of these investments generally approximates market value 
the company s mandatory convertible securities include a provision to reset the interest rate in november the reset rate will be determined by the rates the notes should bear in order for each note to have an aggregate market value of of the principal amount of the note 
if the reset rate was determined at december  the interest rate would have been approximately 
commitments and contingencies the company is obligated to make future payments under various contracts such as debt agreements and capital and operating lease agreements 
the following table sets forth the significant contractual cash obligations of the company as of december  in thousands total thereafter contractual obligations convertible note   mandatory convertible securities   capital lease obligations   non cancelable operating lease obligations  total      in addition  the convertible note provides the holder certain put rights  at par plus accrued interest  on august  if exercised  the company will be required to pay down the entire principal balance at that time 
a collateral account consisting of cash and securities has been established in the amount of million to secure a letter of credit in favor of the convertible note holder 
the letter of credit will expire on august  critical accounting policies in the ordinary course of business the company makes a number of estimates and assumptions relating to the reporting of results of operations and financial condition in the preparation of its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles 
we base our estimates on historical experience  when available  and on other various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe the following critical assumptions and estimates are those applied to revenue recognition  the valuation of investments  goodwill and other long lived intangibles  income taxes  stock option accounting and the possible impact of the recently issued accounting policy financial interpretation no 
fin consolidation of variable interest entities 
revenue recognition advisory fees from mutual funds and sub advisory accounts are computed daily or weekly  while advisory fees from separate accounts and certain alternative investment products are generally computed quarterly based upon account values as of the end of the preceding quarter 
revenues from our alternative investment products generally include an incentive allocation of of the economic profit  as defined  which is recorded as earned 
the incentive allocation fees may increase or decrease during the year as funds profits increase or decrease 
revenues may also include performance fees and fulcrum fees from certain separate accounts and closed end funds based upon meeting or exceeding certain contractual investment return thresholds over a stipulated period of time 
performance fees are finalized and received when the contract period is completed 
investments we hold investments in investment partnerships and affiliates  whose underlying assets consist of marketable securities  which are accounted for using the equity method  under which we record our share of the earnings or losses into income as earned 
while many of these investments are publicly traded and have readily available market valuations  some of their investments are non publicly traded whose value may be difficult to determine 
investments are written down when management believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying investment could result in an inability to recover the carrying value of the investment and thereby require an impairment charge to earnings 
goodwill and other long lived intangible assets prior to the issuance of sfas  goodwill and other long lived intangible assets were amortized each year 
the adoption of sfas at the beginning of  eliminated the amortization of these assets and established requirements for having them tested for impairment at least annually 
at december  management assessed the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets and determined that there was no impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill and other intangible assets  projections regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors are made to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  it may result in an impairment charge for these assets to income 
income taxes in the ordinary course of business  we prepare a number of tax returns  which are regularly audited by federal  state and foreign tax authorities 
the inherent complications in the various tax codes often create the need for subjective judgments in applying its provisions 
while management believes that tax positions taken comply with tax law and are both reasonable and supported by the facts and circumstances of the situation  upon audit additional taxes may be assessed 
the extent to which assessments may be proposed  the ultimate impact on future financial results cannot be determined 
stock based compensation as permitted by sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
we currently account for stock options by the disclosure only provision of this statement  and therefore use the intrinsic value method as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  for accounting for stock based compensation 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of our stock at the date of the option grant over the exercise price 
we have not incurred any such compensation expense during the last three fiscal years 
if we had elected to account for our stock based compensation awards previously issued using the fair value method  the estimated fair value of awards would have been charged against income over the vesting period 
for the year ended december  net income and diluted net income per share would have been lowered by an estimated  and per share  respectively under the fair value method 
the estimated fair value of option awards is determined using the black scholes option pricing model 
this sophisticated model utilizes a number of assumptions in arriving at its results  including the estimate life of the option  the risk free interest rate at the date of grant and the volatility of the underlying common stock 
there may be other factors  which have not been considered  which may have an effect on the value of the options as well 
the effects of changing any of the assumptions or factors employed by the black scholes model may result in a significantly different valuation  net income and net income per share 
recent accounting developments in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  intangible assets with indefinite lives and goodwill will no longer be required to be amortized 
instead  these assets will be evaluated annually for impairment 
the company adopted the provisions of sfas at the beginning of based on managements review and evaluation there was no impairment in the carrying value of its intangible assets including goodwill and it did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements in in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which rescinded sfas no 
reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
under sfas no 
 all gains and losses from extinguishment of debt were required to be aggregated and  if material  classified as an extraordinary item 
as a result of the rescission  the criteria in apb opinion no 
is used to classify gains and losses from debt extinguishments 
since the issuance of sfas no 
 the use of debt extinguishments has become a part of the risk management strategy of many companies  particularly those who participate in the secondary lending markets 
debt extinguishment no longer meets the criteria for classification as extraordinary items in apb opinion no 
accordingly  gains from the repurchase of the company s mandatory convertible in of  have been included in net gain from investments and not as an extraordinary item 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements in and is not expected to have a material impact on future consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others fin  which provides accounting  and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  the interpretations initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the company indemnifies its clearing broker for losses it may sustain from the customer accounts introduced by the company s broker dealer subsidiaries 
in accordance with new york stock exchange rules customer balances are typically collateralized by customer securities or supported by other recourse provisions 
in addition  the company further limits margin balances to a maximum of versus permitted under exchange regulations 
at december  the total amount of customer balances subject to indemnification ie margin debits was immaterial 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure which provides alternative methods of transition to sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and also amends its disclosure provisions 
in addition to the prospective method originally provided under statement  statement provides for a modified prospective and a retroactive restatement method 
sfas further expands the disclosure requirements to require disclosure in condensed consolidated interim financial statements for any period in which stock based awards are outstanding and accounted for using the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
the company will begin expensing options using the fair value recognition provisions of sfas effective january  we are in the process of determining which of the three transition methods provided under sfas will be applied 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  which provides new criteria for determining whether or not consolidation accounting is required 
this interpretation focuses on financial interests that indicate control despite the absence of clear control through voting interests 
it concludes that a company s exposure variable interest to the economic risks and rewards from the variable interest entity s assets and activities are the best evidence of control 
if the company holds the largest variable interest it could be considered the primary beneficiary 
as the primary beneficiary it would be required to include the variable interest entity s assets  liabilities and results of operations in its own financial statements 
this interpretation may require the company to consolidate or provide additional disclosures of the financial information for certain investment partnerships for which it is a general partner 
this interpretation is effective for variable interest entities created after january   otherwise  it is applicable for the first interim or annual reporting period after june  if applicable  the interpretation would require consolidation of an investment partnership s assets and liabilities and results of operation with minority interest recorded for the ownership share applicable to other investors 
the difference between consolidation and the equity method would impact detailed line items reported within the consolidated financial statements but not overall consolidated net income or stockholders equity 
where consolidation is not required additional disclosures maybe required 
refer to note c to the consolidated financial statements 
seasonality and inflation the company does not believe its operations are subject to significant seasonal fluctuations 
the company does not believe inflation will significantly affect its compensation costs  as they are substantially variable in nature 
however  the rate of inflation may affect company expenses such as information technology and occupancy costs 
to the extent inflation results in rising interest rates and has other effects upon the securities markets  it may adversely affect the company s financial position and results of operations by reducing the company s assets under management  revenues or otherwise 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk reference is made to the information contained under the heading management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations market risk
