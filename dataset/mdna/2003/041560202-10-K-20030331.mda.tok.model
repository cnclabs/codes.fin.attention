as of december   the company had amerihost inn hotels open  of which were wholly owned or leased  one was majority owned  and nine were minority owned 
the company opened three amerihost inn hotels in which the company has an ownership interest during the past twelve months 
in addition  the company completed construction of an amerihost inn hotel for an unaffiliated third party in as of december   three wholly owned amerihost inn hotels and one hotel in which the company has a minority ownership interest were under construction 
for all of  same room revenue for all amerihost inn hotels owned and operated by the company  including minority owned hotels  increased approximately  attributable to a increase in occupancy offset by a decrease of in average daily rate 
these results relate to the amerihost inn hotels that have been operating for at least full months during same room revenues for all amerihost inn hotels owned and operated by the company decreased approximately during the fourth quarter of  compared to the fourth quarter of  attributable to a decrease of in occupancy offset by an increase of in average daily rate 
these results relate to the amerihost inn hotels that have been operating for at least full months during the three months ended december  revenues from hotel operations consist of the revenues from all consolidated hotels 
consolidated hotels are those hotels in which the company has a or controlling ownership or leasehold interest  and are consolidated in the company s financial statements 
unconsolidated hotels are those hotels in which the company has a minority or non controlling ownership or leasehold interest  and are accounted for by the equity method 
non core hotels are those hotels operated as independent of a franchise affiliation one hotel as of december   or under a national franchise affiliation other than the amerihost inn brand  such as days inn  ramada inn  and howard johnson express nine hotels as of december  
development and construction revenues consist of fees for new construction and renovation activities performed by the company for unconsolidated hotels and unrelated third parties 
the company records commissions and revenue from the sale of its consolidated amerihost inn hotels  based upon the net sale price  as these sales are considered part of the company s strategy of building and selling hotels  and therefore expanding the amerihost inn brand 
the company receives revenue from management and employee leasing services provided to unconsolidated hotels and unrelated third parties 
incentive and royalty sharing fees consist of the amortization of one time development incentive fees received upon the sale of an amerihost inn hotel to a third party who enters into an amerihost inn franchise agreement  and the company s portion of the franchise royalty fees paid by all amerihost inn hotels to cendant corporation cendant  the franchisor and owner of the amerihost inn brand 
finally  the company also owns the office building in which its headquarters is located  and receives revenues as landlord from the third party tenants in the building 
revenues from consolidated amerihost inn hotels decreased to million during  from revenues of million during  due primarily to the reduction in the number of owned hotels from their sale to third parties  offset by increases in same room revenues 
same room revenues for all consolidated amerihost inn hotels owned and operated by the company increased approximately during  compared to  attributable to a increase in occupancy  partially offset by a decrease of in average daily rate 
these results relate to the consolidated amerihost inn hotels that were operating for at least thirteen full months during revenues from consolidated non core hotels decreased during  compared to  as a result primarily of the decrease in same room revenue 
revenues from hotel sales and commissions decreased to million during  compared to million in  as a result of the sale of five hotels four wholly owned and one leased amerihost inn hotels versus the sale of nine hotels five wholly owned and four leased amerihost inn hotels 
total revenues decreased to million during  from million during the company recorded a net loss of million for  or per diluted share  compared to net income of  or per diluted share in the net loss for included i a gain of  pretax  from an insurance settlement  ii certain one time expenses of approximately  pretax  related to the resignation and replacement of the company s president ceo  and iii non cash charges of approximately  pretax  for an impairment provision on primarily non core hotels 
on september   the company sold the amerihost inn brands and franchising rights to cendant 
the agreement with cendant provides for both short term and long term incentives to the company as the amerihost inn brands are expanded  including i for the year term of the agreement  favorable royalty payment terms on any amerihost inn hotels owned leased and operated by the company  including hotels owned through joint ventures with prior approval from cendant  ii for the year term of the agreement  the sharing of royalties received by cendant from all amerihost inn hotels in the franchise system excluding those owned leased and operated by the company  and iii for the year term of the agreement  a hotel development incentive fee each time an amerihost inn hotel owned leased and operated by the company is sold to an operator who becomes a cendant franchisee 
the company received million in development incentive fees in which were deferred and are being amortized over a month period 
revenues from development incentive and royalty sharing fees  including the amortization of deferred development incentive fees  nearly tripled to approximately  in compared to excluding hotels under construction  the company had an ownership interest in hotels at december   versus hotels at december  the increased ownership from the development of amerihost inn hotels for the company s own account and the acquisition of an amerihost inn hotel from a joint venture was offset by the sale of amerihost inn hotels to cendant franchisees and the sale of one non amerihost inn hotel 
total consolidated hotels decreased slightly to hotels at december   versus hotels at december  operating risks the company s revenues and investments are nearly all in a single industry  the lodging industry 
as a result  the company s operations and results have been  and will be  adversely affected by one or more of the risks inherent in the lodging industry 
these risks  include  but are not limited to competition and seasonality as described under seasonality below  cyclical overbuilding  the results and operations of franchisors utilized by the company s hotels  primarily cendant  changing levels of demand for hotel rooms and related services  as currently evidenced since the downturn in economic conditions and the september  terrorist attacks  unexpected or ongoing increases in hotel expenses  such as insurance  energy and the costs of wages and benefits  demographic and other market changes which impact customer preferences  changes in governmental regulations that impact the hotel s cost of doing business  the inability to fully reduce hotel expenditures to cover hotel revenue shortfalls  the recurring and extraordinary costs of necessary renovations and refurbishment of hotels  and the impact of geopolitical events 
if the present economic and lodging industry slowdown or concerns over geopolitical events worsens significantly  or continues for a protracted period of time  declines in the occupancy levels or average daily rates of the company s hotels could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
critical accounting policies consolidation policy a joint venture project will be consolidated if the company has a majority ie  greater than ownership interest  or when the company has a minority ownership interest ie  less than and can exercise control over the critical decisions of the joint venture 
the company will evaluate several factors in determining whether or not it has control over the joint venture to warrant consolidation 
these factors include the nature of the company s ownership for example  the sole general partner in a limited partnership  the sole managing member of a limited liability company  etc  oversight of the daily operations  and the ability to make major decisions such as to refinance or sell the hotel asset without the consent of the other partners  among others 
minority owned joint ventures in which the company maintains a non controlling ownership interest are accounted for by the equity method 
under this method  the company maintains an investment account  which is increased by contributions made and its share of the joint venture s income  and decreased by distributions received and its share of the joint venture s losses  in accordance with the terms of the joint venture agreement 
the company s share of each joint venture s income or loss  including gains and losses from capital transactions  is reflected on the company s consolidated statement of operations as equity in income and losses from unconsolidated joint ventures 
revenue recognition hotel operations the revenue from the operation of a consolidated hotel is recognized as part of the hotel operations segment when earned 
typically  cash is collected from the guest at the time of check in or checkout  however the company also extends credit to selected corporate customers 
the company had a reserve for specifically identified doubtful corporate accounts receivable in the amount of  at december  the reserve for doubtful accounts is reviewed periodically for reasonableness and is considered appropriate as of december  hotel sales and commissions the company s intention is to operate the consolidated hotels until a buyer is found at an appropriate price 
the company may actively try to sell the hotel during the construction period  upon opening  or anytime thereafter 
once the sale of the hotel is consummated  the company will realize the value from its development 
under this scenario  the company will depreciate the hotel assets and classify them as investment assets while it operates the hotel  since it is not assured that a sale will ultimately be consummated 
beginning in  the company records the hotel sale price as development revenue and the net cost basis of the hotel asset as development expense  when the sale is consummated  as part of the ongoing operational activity of the company 
prior to  the sales of all hotels which had been operated for longer than months  were recorded as a gain on sale below the operating income line  computed as the difference between the net sale price and the net cost basis of building the hotel 
this treatment was considered appropriate since the strategy of building and selling had not yet been solidified until the consummation of the cendant transaction in the latter part of the company recorded million in hotel sales and commission revenue in the reit  which owns certain of the company s leased hotels  closed on the sale of one amerihost inn hotel during the company provides hotel development  management  and staffing services to unrelated third parties and unconsolidated  minority owned joint ventures 
revenues can be generated in three ways i the company will record revenue from the development and construction of the hotel  ii if the company enters into a hotel management agreement with the owner  it will recognize revenue in accordance with the terms of the agreement  and iii if the company enters into a hotel staffing agreement with the owner  it will recognize revenue in accordance with the terms of the agreement as services are performed 
an unrelated third party or an unconsolidated minority owned joint venture may contract with the company for any or all three services 
however  the company will not provide employee leasing services unless it also provides hotel management services pursuant to a written agreement 
hotel development and construction the company recognizes revenue from the development and construction of hotels for third parties and unconsolidated minority owned entities pursuant to development and construction contracts with the hotel ownership entity 
all contracts must be fully executed prior to the start of construction 
in addition  the company will not begin construction on a hotel for a joint venture or third party until it is assured that both the equity and debt financing are in place 
the company records the total contract price as revenue over the development and construction period  and all development and construction costs as operating expenses in the hotel development segment 
development fee revenue from construction renovation projects with unaffiliated third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures is recognized using the percentage of completion method 
construction fee revenue from construction renovation projects with unaffiliated third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures is recognized on the percentage of completion method  generally based on the ratio of costs incurred to estimated total contract costs 
revenue from contract change orders is recognized to the extent costs incurred are recoverable 
profit recognition begins when construction reaches a progress level sufficient to estimate the probable outcome 
provision is made for anticipated future losses in full at the time they are identified 
hotel management services the company recognizes management fee revenue when it performs hotel management services for unrelated third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures 
the management fees are computed based upon a percentage of total hotel revenues  ranging from to  plus incentive fees in certain instances  in accordance with the terms of the individual written management agreements 
the company recognizes the management fee revenue in the hotel management segment as the related hotel revenue is earned 
employee leasing the company recognizes employee leasing revenue when it staffs hotels  and performs related services  for unrelated third parties and unconsolidated joint ventures 
employee leasing revenues are generally computed as the actual payroll costs plus an administrative fee ranging from to  in accordance with the terms of the individual written staffing agreements 
the company recognizes the employee leasing revenue in the employee leasing segment as the related payroll cost is incurred 
although the company maintains employee leasing agreements with the hotel ownership entities  the company is still ultimately responsible for its employees 
in addition  the company is responsible for maintaining and determining staffing levels  scheduling  hiring  firing  performance reviews  etc 
through the company s general managers 
moreover  the company is at risk with regard to personnel issues and lawsuits 
as such  the company has recorded employee leasing revenues primarily as the gross payroll cost  plus the administrative fee 
incentive and royalty sharing the company seeks not only to generate profit from the sale of a hotel  but also to generate a development incentive fee and long term  ongoing royalty sharing revenues from cendant corporation 
cendant has agreed to pay the company a development incentive fee every time the company sells one of its existing amerihost inn hotels to a buyer who executes an amerihost inn franchise agreement with cendant 
in addition  this fee also will be paid to the company for new hotels that the company develops which are then sold to a franchisee of cendant 
this fee applies to the first hotels sold by the company during the year term of the agreement 
the fee is computed based on the most recent twelve months revenue  or a stipulated per room amount if the hotel has been open less than one year 
since the cendant agreement provides for the potential reimbursement of this fee  from future fees earned  in the event the buyer defaults on the franchise agreement within the first months  these fees are deferred when received  in accordance with staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
the deferred fees are amortized as incentive and royalty sharing segment revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements on a straight line basis over the month period  as the contingencies on the revenues are removed 
cendant has agreed to pay the company a portion of all royalty fees cendant receives from all of its amerihost inn franchisees through september generally  cendant receives royalty fees from each of their franchisees based upon a percentage of guest room revenue  ranging from to 
in turn  cendant will pay the company a portion of this fee as stipulated in the agreement 
the company includes this royalty sharing fee as incentive and royalty sharing fee revenue in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
deferred income during and  the company sold hotels to a real estate investment trust reit for approximately million 
upon the sale of the hotels  the company simultaneously entered into agreements to lease back each of the hotels from the reit 
the leases are for an initial term of years  as amended  and provide for rent in the amount of of the original sale price  increased annually after year three by the lesser of or the cpi adjustment 
the gains from the sale of the hotels in and were deferred for financial statement reporting purposes  due to the continuing involvement with the long term lease agreement  and are being amortized on a straight line basis into income as a reduction of leasehold rent expense over the year initial term 
assuming the company leases all of the remaining reit hotels until the end of the term  approximately  will be amortized annually as a reduction of leasehold rent expense 
upon the sale of a hotel  which is owned by the reit to an unaffiliated third party  the remaining unamortized deferred income is recognized as gain on sale of fixed assets in the company s consolidated financial statements 
when the company builds a hotel for an unconsolidated joint venture  a portion of the profit is deferred 
the deferral is computed as the company s ownership in the joint venture  multiplied by the development fee profit and the construction profit as it is recognized on the percentage of completion basis 
the deferred income is recognized by the company over the estimated useful life of the related hotel asset 
a portion of the deferral is amortized over the same life the joint venture is depreciating the hotel asset generally  years  and the remaining portion is amortized over the same life the joint venture is depreciating the furniture  fixtures equipment generally  years 
upon the sale of a hotel by the joint venture to an unaffiliated third party  the remaining unamortized deferred income is recognized as equity in income and loss of affiliates in the company s consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets on january  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
the statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas requires a long lived asset for sale to be classified as held for sale in the period in which certain criteria are met  including that the sale of the asset within one year is probable 
based on historical experience and the company s business strategy  the company does not generally assess a sale as probable before the transaction closes  and does not believe any of its properties meet all of the criteria necessary to classify assets as held for sale as of december  sfas also requires that the results of operations of a component of an entity that either has been disposed of or is classified as held for sale be reported in discontinued operations if the operations and cash flows of the component have been or will be eliminated from its ongoing operations 
the company does not include the sales or operations of amerihost inn hotels in discontinued operations because it retains ongoing royalty fees from those hotels after their sale 
the operations of all other long lived assets sold or classified as held for sale are reflected as discontinued operations 
as of december   there were no identifiable discontinued operations 
the company periodically reviews the carrying value of certain of its long lived assets  including its investment in and advances to joint ventures which own long lived assets  in relation to historical results  current business conditions and trends to identify potential situations in which the carrying value of assets may not be recoverable 
if such reviews indicate that the carrying value of such assets may not be recoverable  the company would estimate the undiscounted sum of the expected cash flows of such assets to determine if such sum is less than the carrying value of such assets to ascertain if an impairment exists 
if an impairment exists  the company would determine the fair value by using quoted market prices  if available for such assets 
if quoted market prices are not available  the company would obtain an appraisal or discount the expected future cash flows of such assets 
during  the company s reviews indicated that there was no permanent impairment of the company s long lived assets 
during  the company reduced the carrying value of its investments in three unconsolidated joint ventures two amerihost inn hotels and one non core hotel by approximately  in connection with such review 
in addition  during  the company reduced the carrying value of an investment in one non core consolidated joint venture by  in connection with such review 
the impairment adjustments for the investments in the two unconsolidated amerihost inn joint ventures and one non core consolidated joint venture are reflected as an impairment provision in the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the impairment adjustment for its investment in one non core unconsolidated joint venture is reflected in equity in net income loss from unconsolidated joint ventures in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

nevertheless  same room revenues for all amerihost inn hotels owned and operated by the company  including consolidated and unconsolidated hotels  increased approximately during  compared to  as occupancy increased and average daily rate decreased 
the company believes that as the number of amerihost inn hotels operated by both the company and others increases  the greater the benefits will be at all amerihost inn locations from marketplace recognition and repeat business

financing risks the availability of financing on reasonable terms is critical to the ability of the company to develop hotels  maintain its operations and sell hotels 
the company s results and prospects may be materially affected by the availability and conditions of development and mortgage financing and lines of credit for the company and for potential purchasers and franchisees of the company s hotels 
the requirements of lenders may be influenced by economic and geopolitical conditions  as well as the company s business 
changes in the availability or terms of financing could have a material adverse effect on the company 
seasonality the lodging industry  in general  is seasonal by nature 
the company s hotel revenues are generally greater in the second and third calendar quarters than in the first and fourth quarters due to weather conditions in the primarily midwest markets in which the company s hotels are located  as well as general business and leisure travel trends 
this seasonality can be expected to continue to cause quarterly fluctuations in the company s revenues 
quarterly earnings also may be adversely affected by events beyond the company s control  such as extreme weather conditions  economic factors  securities and geopolitical concerns and other general factors affecting travel 
in addition  hotel construction is seasonal  depending upon the geographic location of the construction projects 
construction activity in the midwest may be slower in the first and fourth calendar quarters due to weather conditions 
also  since the company s management fees are based upon a percentage of the hotel s total gross revenues  the company is further susceptible to seasonal variations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to the company s long term debt obligations 
the company has some cash flow exposure on its long term debt obligations to changes in market interest rates 
the company primarily enters into long term debt obligations in connection with the development and financing of hotels 
the company maintains a mix of fixed and floating debt to mitigate its exposure to interest rate fluctuations 
the company s management believes that fluctuations in interest rates in the near term would not materially affect the company s consolidated operating results  financial position or cash flows  as the company has limited risks related to interest rate fluctuations 
the table below provides information about financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  for each interest rate sensitive asset or liability as of december  the carrying amounts reflected approximate the estimated fair values 
as the table incorporates only those exposures that existed as of december   it does not consider those exposures or positions which could arise after that date 
moreover  the information presented therein is merely an estimate and has limited predictive value 
as a result  the ultimate realized gain or loss with respect to interest rate fluctuations will depend on the exposures that arise during future periods  hedging strategies and prevailing interest rates at the time
