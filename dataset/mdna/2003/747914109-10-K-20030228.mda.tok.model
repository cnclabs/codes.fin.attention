item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements  and notes thereto  contained elsewhere in this report 
overview q med r  inc is a delaware corporation incorporated in  whose business was organized in interactive heart management corp 
ihmc r is a wholly owned subsidiary of qmed  which was incorporated in ihmc developed and is co marketing with qmed health care information and communication services to health plans  governments and private companies 
these services include ohms cvd r online health management system for cardiovascular disease which is an integrated cardiovascular disease management system 
ohms cvd includes related systems to assist health plans  government organizations and employer groups in managing the incidence  treatment  and cost of cardiovascular conditions  including coronary artery disease cad  stroke  congestive heart failure chf  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes 
these systems are designed to aid primary health care physicians in the use of optimal evidence based medical management for patients with these conditions  as well as those at high risk of developing these conditions 
the net impact of this approach is the improvement in cardiovascular health and the associated reduction in mortality  morbidity and cost 
as of november   we had contracts to provide these services to health plans in states covering approximately million health plan members 
our disease management program is for members identified as being at high risk for significant and costly episodes of care 
the program is supported by technology that is designed to deliver the best clinical and financial outcomes to our customers 
as of november   we contracted to provide services in a medicare demonstration project and to health plans nationwide 
in october  we were selected to participate with two other entities in a second disease management program for the centers for medicare and medicaid services 
the program is expected to begin in the second quarter of fiscal management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements  which are based upon current expectations and involve a number of risks and uncertainties 
in order for us to utilize the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  investors are hereby cautioned that these statements may be affected by the important factors  among others  set forth below  and consequently  actual operations and results may differ materially from those expressed in these forward looking statements 
the important factors include o our ability to renew and or maintain contracts with its customers under existing terms or restructure these contracts on terms that would not have a material negative impact on our results of operations  o our ability to execute new contracts for health plan disease management services  o the risks associated with a significant concentration of our revenues with a limited number of health plan customers  o our ability to effect estimated cost savings and clinical outcome improvements under health plan disease management contracts and reach mutual agreement with customers with respect to cost savings  or to effect such savings and improvements within the timeframes contemplated by us  o the ability of our health plan customers to provide timely and accurate data that is essential to the operation and measurement of our performance under the terms of its health plan contracts  o our ability to resolve favorably contract billing and interpretation issues with its health plan customers  o our ability to effectively integrate new technologies into our care management information technology platform  o our ability to obtain adequate financing to provide the capital that may be needed to support the growth of our health plan operations and financing or insurance to support our performance under new health plan contracts  o unusual and unforeseen patterns of healthcare utilization by individuals within the health plans with cardiovascular conditions  including coronary artery disease cad  stroke  congestive heart failure chf  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes with which we have executed disease management contracts  o the ability of the health plans to maintain the number of covered lives enrolled in the plans during the terms of the agreements between the health plans and us  o our ability to attract and or retain and effectively manage the employees required to implement our agreements with health plan organizations  o the impact of future state and federal healthcare legislation and regulations on our ability to deliver services o the financial health of our customers and their willingness to purchase our services o the impact of litigation involving us o general economic conditions we undertake no obligation to update or revise any such forward looking statements 
critical accounting policies our accounting policies are described in note of the consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended november  the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policy to be the most critical in understanding the judgments involved in preparing the financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
revenue recognition we enter into contractual arrangements with health plans to provide disease management services 
fees under our health plan contracts are generally determined by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per health plan member per month pmpm by the number of health plan members covered by our services during the month 
the pmpm rates usually differ between contracts due to the various types of health plan product groups eg ppo  hmo  medicare choice 
these contracts are generally for terms of three to five years with provisions for subsequent renewal  and typically provide that all or a portion of our fees may be performance based 
performance based contracts have varying degrees of risk associated with our ability to deliver the guaranteed financial cost savings 
in most cases we guarantee a percentage reduction of disease costs compared to a prior baseline year determined by actuarial analysis and other estimates used as a basis to measure performance objectives 
the measurement of our performance against the base year information is a data intensive and time consuming process that is typically not completed until six to eight months after the end of the contract year 
we bill our customers each month for the entire amount of the fees contractually due based on previous months membership  which always includes the amount  if any that may be subject to refund for member retroactivity and a shortfall in performance 
we adjust or defer revenue for contracts where we believe that there could be an issue of non performance  possibly resulting in a refund of fees or where fees generated may be subject to further retroactive adjustment associated with a contract or plan s decision to completely terminate its coverage in a geographic market as well as general membership changes 
for example  general terminations can be due to death  member change of health plan  etc 
adjustments for non performance under the terms of the contract or other factors affecting revenue recognition are accrued on an estimated basis in the period the services are provided and are adjusted in future periods when final settlement is determined 
we review these estimates periodically and make adjustments  as interim information is available 
we determine our level of performance at interim periods based on medical claims data  achievement of enrollment targets or other data required to be supplied by the health plan 
in the event these interim performance measures indicate that performance targets are not being met or sufficient data is unavailable  fees  which could be subject to refund  are not recorded as revenue but rather are recorded as a current liability entitled contract billings in excess of revenues 
under performance based arrangements  the ability to make estimates at interim periods can be challenging due to the inherent nature of the medical claims process and the lag time associated with it 
in most cases  complete paid claims data is not available until up to six months after claims are incurred 
although interim data measurements are indicative of performance objectives  actual results could differ from our estimates 
as of november   based on information and data available at this time  we deferred approximately  related to contracts with two regence health plans  regence oregon and washington  which may be subject to refund 
this deferral has been reflected as contract billings in excess of revenues on the balance sheet 
services are provided under these regence contracts through heartmasters  a limited liability company whose members are ihmc and lifemasters  an unaffiliated private company  under which we provide coronary artery disease management services and life masters provides services for congestive heart failure 
since these contracts are performance based  heartmasters has limited its exposure under these contracts by purchasing insurance from an unaffiliated insurer in the amount of approximately  the deferral of approximately  represents fees in excess of its share of insurance coverage 
heartmasters has submitted an estimate of claims in the amount of approximately  to the insurer and the claims are currently under review by the insurer 
the contract billings in excess of revenues on the balance sheet is subject to reconciliation at future periods  however  since the initial contract year reconciliation did not provide positive results and enrollment targets have not improved  all of the revenue from this agreement which is estimated to be subject to refund is deferred in accordance with our revenue recognition policy 
if future reconciliations provide positive results  revenue will be recorded at that time 
we believe these estimates adequately provide for any potential adjustments that may be applied to revenues from these contracts 
although these contracts are multi year agreements  since both parties have been unable to reach a resolution on certain modifications to the contracts  the regence oregon and washington contracts terminated as of january  we also have contracts with regence of idaho and utah 
regence idaho and utah contracts are not subject to the same terms and conditions as those in oregon and washington 
in addition  the idaho and utah contract outcomes are designed to measure the effect of our disease management of coronary disease and stroke against a control population not managed by a formal disease management process 
we determined that while there were modest savings in oregon and washington  the contract contained a number of unforeseeable issues  which made the expected outcome unachievable 
certain provisions in the contract covering all claims versus disease specific claims had a negative impact on contract performance to date 
these provisions are not included in any of our other disease management contracts 
furthermore  we operate all of our other contractual agreements without any outside parties involvement 
during the fiscal years ended november   and  approximately and  respectively  of disease management services were derived from two health plans that each comprised more than of our revenues  one of which is regence 
during fiscal  revenues from five health plans comprised more than of our revenue 
health plan contracts most of our revenues in fiscal through were generated from programs designed to assist health plans in improving the quality of care for health plan members with diseases such as coronary artery disease  stroke  congestive heart failure  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes 
these programs are designed to improve care and to reduce healthcare costs 
we anticipate that a substantial portion of our future revenue growth will continue to result from providing disease management services to health plans 
we also believe that a greater portion of our future revenue will be from contracts with cms 
we first introduced a coronary artery disease program with a medical group in since that time  we added congestive heart failure  stroke  hypertension  hyperlipidemia and the cardiovascular complications of diabetes to our program 
during fiscal  we were awarded a medicare coordinated care demonstration project  which is designed to evaluate the cost effectiveness of reimbursing disease management services in the medicare fee for service model 
enrollment of patients under this program began in fiscal during fiscal  we received an accreditation by the national committee on quality assurance 
in october  we  together with two other entities  were selected to participate in a disease management program for the centers for medicare and medicaid services 
the program is expected to begin in the second quarter of fiscal our disease management services include the stratification of high risk patients  contact with their primary care physicians  review of patient chart information  contact and assessment with the patient and coordination of care with the primary care physician 
fees under our health plan contracts are generally determined by multiplying a contractually negotiated rate per health plan member per month pmpm by the number of health plan members covered by our services during the month 
the pmpm rates usually differ between contracts due to the various types of health plan product groups eg ppo  hmo  medicare 
these contracts are generally for terms of three to five years with provisions for subsequent renewal  and typically provide that all or a portion of our fees may be performance based 
we earn performance based fees upon achieving a targeted percentage reduction in the customer s healthcare costs  in addition to clinical and other criteria  compared to a baseline year 
the membership enrollment and disenrollment processes of our health plan customers can result in a cyclical reduction of lives under management  especially during our first quarter 
employers typically make decisions about health insurance carriers at the end of each calendar year 
health plans also assess the types of markets they service as well as the contractual arrangements of medical groups within those markets 
in any event  all of these factors will have an effect on membership as of january of each year 
a health plans decision to exit markets or non renewal of contracts with their medical groups will result in a loss of covered lives under management as of january although these decisions may also result in a gain of members  the process of identification and enrollment will typically lag by six months or longer 
as a result  we have experienced a loss of covered lives of approximately of total covered lives as of december   thereby negatively affecting our revenues in the first quarter of fiscal during the fiscal years ended november   and  approximately and  respectively  of disease management services were derived from two health plans that each comprised more than of our revenues 
during fiscal revenues from five health plans comprised more than of our revenue 
during fiscal  the same two health plans as in each comprised more than of the company s revenues 
one of these contracts terminated as of january   which represented approximately of our membership 
since most of the revenue from this contract was previously deferred  revenue for the first quarter will only be reduced by approximately due to this contract termination 
our strategy is to develop additional cms contracts  business contracts with health plans to provide disease management services and to further develop and expand our cardiovascular disease management business 
we anticipate that we will utilize our state of the art medical information technologies to gain a competitive advantage in delivering disease management services 
we anticipate that significant investments will continue to be made during fiscal in the development of the clinical programs  the associated information technology support for these expanded initiatives and that many of these investments will be made prior to the initiation of revenues from contracts 
it is also anticipated that some of these new capabilities and technologies may be added through strategic alliances with other entities 
we anticipate that additional disease management contracts that we may sign with health plans  employer groups and governmental agencies may take one of several forms  including per member per month payments to us  some form of shared savings of overall enrollee healthcare costs  fee for services for enrolled members  or some combination of these arrangements 
we anticipate that under most contracts  some portion of our fees will be at risk and subject to our performance against financial cost savings and clinical improvements 
when we believe it is prudent to do so  we may insure or reserve against a portion of revenue

reclassification adjustment for gains included in net income 
comprehensive income loss not meaningful fiscal compared to fiscal revenues for fiscal increased million or from fiscal due to an increase in the number of health plan contracts as well as the increase in the number of members actually enrolled in our program during the fiscal year which were previously contracted for 
at the end of fiscal we had approximately  commercial members and approximately  medicare choice members compared to approximately  commercial members and  medicare choice at the end of fiscal approximately million of revenue came from new contracts that were implemented during the largest portion of our revenue increase was due to the increased enrollment during this fiscal year of contracts signed during fiscal approximately million was due to increased enrollment in one health plan whose total revenue accounted for approximately of our total revenue for fiscal we anticipate that revenue for fiscal will increase over fiscal revenues primarily from additional members enrolled under our existing and anticipated new health plan contracts as well as the growth in governmental contracts with cms for the medicare fee for service market 
during fiscal  we sold unused state net operating loss carryforwards for cash by way of the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program through our ihmc subsidiary 
we received approximately  from this transaction 
cost of revenue for fiscal increased million or compared to fiscal primarily due to higher staffing levels associated with the increases in enrollment of our health plan members  associated travel costs  physician s fees and related expenses 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased to in fiscal from in fiscal this increase was primarily due to the costs associated with the staffing and continued enrollment of members in regence of oregon and washington during fiscal where revenues from these contracts were not being recognized 
we anticipate that the cost of revenue for fiscal will increase over fiscal due to the implementation of the cms medicare contract  where revenue will lag implementation costs by several months 
selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal increased by approximately  or compared to fiscal primarily due to increased administrative staff to support our overall growth 
selling general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal primarily due to our ability to leverage our selling  general and administrative expenses as a result of the growth in our health plan operations 
research and development expenses for fiscal increased by approximately  or compared to fiscal during the past year we have focused our efforts primarily on the development of new  advanced software programs to enable us to better identify  locate and evaluate patients who are at risk for developing various disease conditions 
these programs incorporate state of the art telecommunications  data management  security and information technology 
we intend to continue to improve and expand the capabilities of our systems ongoing 
fiscal compared to fiscal total revenues for fiscal increased by approximately  or when compared to fiscal the total revenue increase consists of an increase in the disease management segment of approximately  or compared to fiscal offset by a decrease in medical equipment sales of approximately  or compared to fiscal the increase in revenues from to primarily resulted from an increase in total membership from health plan contracts for our disease management business segment to approximately million members for fiscal compared to approximately  members for fiscal this increase was primarily the result of new health plan contracts signed and implemented during fiscal and at november   of the  plan members under contract  we had  commercial members and  medicare choice members 
revenue for medicare choice members is significantly higher than commercial members 
we did not have a significant number of medicare choice members in fiscal we expect to have a slightly higher percentage of medicare choice membership in fiscal  and  if this occurs  increases in revenue may result primarily from this change in membership mix 
we expect revenue growth for to continue to increase over as a result of additional members enrolled under our existing contracts as well as anticipated new health plan contracts during fiscal during fiscal  we sold unused state net operating loss carryforwards for cash by way of the new jersey technology tax certificate transfer program through our ihmc subsidiary 
we received approximately  from this transaction 
we also had remaining tax benefits  which were sold as part of the program during fiscal in which we received approximately  gross profit margins increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase was primarily the result of revenue growth in the disease management segment 
during fiscal we were able to contract with different plans within the same geographic area  which also assisted in improving gross margins 
selling  general and administrative expenses for the year ended november  increased by approximately  or when compared to fiscal the increase includes a non recurring charge of  associated with an executive employee s compensation expense and severance payment 
without this charge  selling general and administrative expenses would have increased by approximately  or when compared to the increase primarily resulted from an increase in salaries and benefits associated with increased staff to support the higher levels of members enrolled in our disease management programs  incentive payments for new contracts and achievement of targeted performance goals 
we expect selling  general and administrative expenses to continue to increase as we add more health plan contracts  increase staffing levels and increase employee compensation associated with improvement of operating performance 
research and development expenses increased in fiscal by approximately  or when compared to fiscal the increase is primarily the increase in staffing levels in our information technology department 
we have dedicated these resources primarily on new product software development and upgrades to existing technology in order to support our current operations  new disease states managed and the increased volume of patients associated 
liquidity and capital resources to date  our principal sources of working capital have been provided by proceeds from public and private placements of securities and the sale of certain assets 
since our inception  sales of securities and assets have generated approximately  less applicable expenses 
we had working capital of  at november  compared to  at november  and ratios of current assets to current liabilities of as of november  and as of november  the working capital increase of approximately  was primarily due to the net income of approximately  and proceeds from the sale of common stock through the exercise of outstanding options and warrants of approximately  in september we entered into a  line of credit agreement with first union national bank 
outstanding balances under the loan bear interest at an annual rate equal to the lower of the bank s reference rate minus or libor plus 
as of november  the entire  was available under this credit line 
we anticipate that funds generated from operations  together with cash and investments  and availability under our credit line will be sufficient to fund our current level of growth 
however  to the extent the expansion of our operations requires significant additional resources or certain forms of financial guarantees to assure its performance under the terms of new health plan contracts  we may be required to seek additional financing 
no assurance can be given that such financing would be available on terms that would be acceptable to us 
material commitments the following schedule summarizes our contractual cost obligation as of november  in the periods indicated 
contractual payments due by period obligations total less than years years after years year long term debt capital lease obligations    operating leases     unconditional purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual cash obligations     other commercial commitments amount of commitment expiration per period total amounts less than years years after years committed year line of credit standby letters of credit guarantees standby repurchase obligations other commercial commitments total commercial commitments additional factors that may affect future results future operating results 
future operating results  which reflect management s current expectations may be impacted by a number of factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those stated herein 
these factors include worldwide economic and political conditions  terrorist s activities  industry specific factors  our ability to maintain access to external financing sources and its financial liquidity  the acceptance of our disease management system by health plan organizations  and our ability to manage expense levels 
need for additional capital 
as of november   we had approximately  cash and short term investments 
nevertheless  our future success is highly dependent upon our continued access to capital markets  which we believe are necessary for the continued support of our growth 
in the event we are unable to maintain access to our existing financing sources  or obtain other sources of financing  there would be a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
fluctuations in our quarterly operating results may cause volatility in the price of our common stock and the debentures 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenue and profitability 
as demand for our services has increased in recent periods  our quarterly sales and operating results have become highly dependent on the timing of contracts signed and programs implemented during the quarter  which are difficult to forecast 
in addition  a portion of our operating expenses is relatively fixed in nature due to our sales  research and development costs 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems  and problems with the redesign and implementation of these new systems could interfere with our operations 
we are in the process of implementing new information systems to enhance our current systems in order to improve our operating effectively and expand the range of disease management services we offer 
we may not be successful in implementing these new systems and transitioning data 
as part of this effort  we are implementing new enterprise resource planning software applications to manage our business operations 
failure to smoothly and successfully implement this and other systems could temporarily interrupt our operations and adversely impact our ability to run our business 
in addition  any failure or significant downtime in our new information systems could prevent us from efficiently implementing disease management programs  reconciling cost savings and could harm our business 
if we do not introduce successful new disease management services in a timely manner  our services will become obsolete  and our operating results will suffer 
our services are for industries that are characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and changing industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products  services and enhancements  our products and services will become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product and service offerings will depend on several factors  including our ability to o properly identify customer needs  o innovate and develop new technologies  services and applications  o successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  o differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings  o price our services competitively  and o anticipate our competitors announcements of new products  services or technological innovations our business will suffer if we are not able to retain and hire key personnel 
our future success depends partly on the continued service of our key research  engineering  sales  marketing  manufacturing  executive and administrative personnel 
if we fail to retain and hire a sufficient number of these personnel  we will not be able to maintain or expand our business 
although the labor market has changed dramatically within the past year  and our attrition rate has dropped  there is still intense competition for certain highly technical specialties in geographic areas where we continue to recruit 
acquisitions  strategic alliances  and joint ventures may result in financial results that are different than expected 
we engage in discussions with third parties relating to possible acquisitions  strategic alliances  and joint ventures 
as a result of such transactions  our financial results may differ from the investment community s expectations in a given quarter 
in addition  acquisitions and strategic alliances may require us to integrate a different company culture  management team and business infrastructure 
we may have difficulty developing  manufacturing and marketing the products of a newly acquired company in a way that enhances the performance of our combined businesses or product lines to realize the value from expected synergies 
depending on the size and complexity of an acquisition  our successful integration of the entity depends on a variety of factors  including o the retention of key employees  o the management of facilities and employees in separate geographic areas  o the retention of key customers  and o the integration or coordination of different research and development  product manufacturing and sales programs and facilities all of these efforts require varying levels of management resources  which may divert our attention from other business operations 
if we do not realize the expected benefits from such transactions  our financial position results and stock price could be negatively impacted 
we and our customers are subject to various governmental regulations  compliance with which may cause us to incur significant expenses  and if we fail to maintain satisfactory compliance with certain regulations  we may be forced to curtail operations  and we could be subject to civil or criminal penalties 
our businesses are subject to various significant federal  state and local  health and safety  health information disclosure  and labor regulations 
these regulations are complex  change frequently and have tended to become more stringent over time 
we may be required to incur significant expenses to comply with these regulations or to remedy violations of these regulations 
any failure by us to comply with applicable government regulations could also result in cessation of our operations or portions of our operations  or impositions of fines and restrictions on our ability to carry on or expand our operations 
litigation regarding patents or intellectual property could be costly and time consuming 
any litigation regarding patents or other intellectual property could be costly and time consuming and could divert our management and key personnel from our business operations 
the complexity of the technology involved and the uncertainty of intellectual property litigation increase these risks 
claims of intellectual property infringement might also require us to enter into costly royalty or license agreements 
however  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements on terms acceptable to us  or at all 
we also may be subject to significant damages or injunctions against development and sale of certain of our products 
third parties may infringe our intellectual property  and we may expend significant resources enforcing our rights or suffer competitive injury 
our success depends in large part on our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets  confidentiality provisions and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
if we fail to successfully enforce our intellectual property rights  our competitive position could suffer  which could harm our operating results 
our pending patent and trademark registration applications may not be allowed  or competitors may challenge the validity or scope of these patents or trademark registrations 
in addition  our patents may not provide us a significant competitive advantage 
we may be required to spend significant resources to monitor and police our intellectual property rights 
we may not be able to detect infringement and our competitive position may be harmed before we do so 
in addition  competitors may design around our technology or develop competing technologies 
intellectual property rights may also be unavailable or limited in some foreign countries  which could make it easier for competitors to capture market share
