competition the property and casualty insurance industry is highly competitive 
the company competes with numerous insurance companies  many of which are substantially larger and have considerably greater financial resources 
in addition  because the company s products are marketed exclusively through page independent insurance agencies  most of which represent more than one company  the company faces competition within each agency 
see marketing in the narrative description of business 
the company competes through underwriting criteria  appropriate pricing  quality service to the policyholder and the agent  and a fully developed agency relations program 
another underwriting and claims issue the company is confronting is toxic mold 
this source of loss has received significant publicity in recent months  and indications are that mold claims will increase in the future 
the company believes that  under its insurance policies  the company is not obligated to cover this kind of commonly occurring condition  particularly when remediation costs are extreme 
hence  to protect its current rate structure  the company has filed mold limitations and exclusions on homeowner policies and certain commercial policies in all states that will accept such filings 
employees as of march   the company had  employees 
this includes employees who had been employees of migi until january  employees of the company are not covered by any collective bargaining agreement

the following is a summary of several transactions that occurred in the second half of that will assist in the discussion of the company s current period financial results effective june   mutual merged with meridian mutual insurance company meridian mutual  with mutual continuing as the surviving corporation  and acquired migi 
effective july   the insurance business of the former meridian mutual became part of the pooling arrangement and the pooled subsidiaries assumed of the meridian mutual business on this same date 
concurrent with this transaction  the pooled subsidiaries received cash of million and fixed maturities totaling million  which related to the additional net insurance liabilities assumed by the pooled subsidiaries on july  the business of the former meridian mutual provides both standard and nonstandard personal lines and standard commercial lines to its policyholders 
the principal lines of business include standard personal and commercial automobile  nonstandard personal automobile  homeowners  commercial multi peril  workers compensation  general liability and fire insurance 
this former meridian mutual business assumed by the pooled subsidiaries comprises the company s meridian standard and meridian nonstandard segments 
effective october   the management agreement was amended to eliminate the management and operations services fee charged by state auto p c to participants to the agreement  including mutual 
as a result of the loss of this income  substantially all of state auto p c s services income was eliminated at that time 
consequently  beginning with the first quarter page  the management and operations services segment is included in the all other category for segment reporting  as the results of this segment no longer meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as a reportable segment 
see reportable segments included herein and footnote regarding the company s operating segments in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
the pooling arrangement was amended  effective october   such that the pooled subsidiaries aggregate participation was increased from to 
in conjunction with this change in pool participation  the pooled subsidiaries received cash of million and fixed maturities totaling million from mutual  which related to the additional net insurance liabilities assumed by the pooled subsidiaries on october  for the period october  through december   mutual entered into a stop loss reinsurance arrangement the stop loss with the pooled subsidiaries 
under the stop loss  mutual has agreed to participate in the pooling arrangement s quarterly underwriting losses and gains in the manner described 
if the pooling arrangement s quarterly statutory loss and loss adjustment expense ratio the pool loss and lae ratio is between and after the application of all available reinsurance  mutual will reinsure the pooled subsidiaries of the pooling arrangement s losses in excess of a pool loss and lae ratio of up to 
the pooled subsidiaries would be responsible for their share of the pooling arrangement s losses over the threshold 
also  mutual will have the right to participate in the profits of the pooling arrangement 
mutual will assume of the pooling arrangement s underwriting profits attributable to pool loss and lae ratios less than  but more than 
as the former meridian mutual standard and nonstandard business continues to be written and processed through the meridian underwriting and claims system platform  management has monitored this business as separate segments from the state auto standard and nonstandard processed business 
monitoring of these segments separately has been necessary in order to facilitate the integration of the business as it migrates through new policies and renewals to the state auto systems platform in which state auto policies  pricing  underwriting  and claims philosophies are fully reflected 
over time  it is anticipated that the meridian operating segments will decrease and eventually disappear as they become fully integrated on to the state auto systems platform 
with the addition of the former meridian mutual business to the pooling arrangement  the company renamed the two insurance segments that existed prior to to be the state auto standard segment and the state auto nonstandard segment and that business consisting of the business known formerly as the meridian mutual business to be the meridian standard segment and meridian nonstandard segment 
due to the integration efforts that occurred within the meridian nonstandard segment during and  beginning with the first quarter of  the meridian nonstandard business will be included in the state auto nonstandard segment 
critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements  management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities as of the date of the balance sheet  revenues and expenses for the period then ended and the financial entries in the accompanying notes to the financial statements 
such estimates and assumptions could change in the future  as more information becomes known which could impact the amounts reported and disclosed therein 
losses and loss expenses payable are management s best estimates at a given point in time of what the company expects to pay claimants  based on known facts  circumstances and historical trends 
reserves for reported losses are established on either a case by case or formula basis depending on the type and circumstances of the loss 
the case by case reserve amounts are determined based on the company s reserving practices  which take into account the type of risk  the circumstances surrounding each claim and policy provisions relating to types of loss 
the formula reserves are based on historical data for similar claims with provision for trend changes caused by inflation 
loss and loss expense reserves for incurred claims that have not yet been reported are estimated based on many variables including historical and statistical information  inflation  legal developments  storm loss estimates  and page economic conditions 
case and formula basis loss reserves are reviewed on a regular basis and as new data becomes available  estimates are updated resulting in adjustments to loss reserves 
generally  reported losses that had initially been reserved on a formula basis which have not settled after six months  are case reserved at that time 
although management uses many resources to calculate reserves  there is no precise method for determining the ultimate liability 
acquisition costs  consisting of commissions  premium taxes  and certain underwriting expenses relating to the production of property and casualty business  are deferred and amortized ratably over the contract period 
the method followed computing the acquisition costs limit the amount of such deferred costs to their estimated realizable value 
in determining estimated realizable value  the computation gives effect to the premium to be earned  losses and loss expenses to be incurred  and certain other costs expected to be incurred as premium is earned 
these amounts are based on estimates  and accordingly  the actual realizable value may vary from the estimated realizable value 
at december   fixed maturity and equity security investments are classified as available for sale and carried at fair value 
at december   fixed maturities are classified either as held to maturity and carried at amortized cost  or available for sale and carried at fair value 
for investments classified as available for sale  the net unrealized holding gains or losses  net of applicable deferred taxes  are shown as a separate component of stockholders equity as accumulated other comprehensive income  and as such are not included in the determination of net income 
investment income is recognized when earned  and capital gains and losses are recognized when investments are sold 
the company regularly monitors its investment portfolio for declines in value that are other than temporary  an assessment which requires significant management judgment 
among the factors management considers are market conditions  the amount  timing and length of decline in fair value  and events impacting the issuer 
when a security in the company s investment portfolio has a decline in fair value which is other than temporary  the company adjusts the cost basis of the security to fair value 
this results in a charge to earnings as a realized loss  which is not changed for subsequent recoveries in fair value 
future increases or decreases in fair value  if not other than temporary  are included in other comprehensive income 
see a discussion of other factors that may have an impact on management s best estimates at impact of significant external factors included herein 
results of operations compared to net income for the company increased by million in contributing to this increase was a point improvement in the company s gaap combined ratio and  as more fully described above  changes made to the company s participation in the pooling arrangement in the second half of additionally  net investment income increased due to the pooling arrangement changes in  which was offset by a decrease in the company s management and operations service income 
consolidated earned premiums increased by million in this increase was the result of the addition of the former meridian mutual business to the pooling arrangement  effective july   a change in the pooled subsidiaries aggregate pooling participation percentage from to  effective october  and total net internal growth of 
the addition of the former meridian mutual business and the pooling change increased consolidated earned premiums 
the internal growth of the state auto standard segment s earned premiums increased consolidated earned premiums 
this increase was driven by growth in commercial lines of business due to a combination of rate changes as well as increased policy counts 
personal lines of business continued to experience sales increases over prior year due to changes in the marketplace that permitted rate increases  as well as the expansion of the new personal lines sales specialist position that contributed to increased policy counts 
the internal growth of the state auto nonstandard segment earned premiums increased consolidated earned premiums due to a combination of rate changes and increased policy counts 
page the internal decline of the meridian standard and nonstandard segments decreased consolidated earned premiums 
this decrease was expected  given the corrective actions taken by management in both these segments  which actions included appropriate and necessary rate increases in almost every line of business 
additionally  one of the more significant actions taken within the meridian standard segment was the discontinuance in late of the group advantage r program which had generated substantial underwriting losses for meridian mutual 
the last group advantage r policy on the books terminated january regarding the meridian nonstandard segment  in addition to taking significant corrective rate action  beginning in late  the company implemented an integration plan to write all new nonstandard auto business produced by the former meridian mutual agents through the state auto nonstandard segment  specifically through national on the national system platform utilizing a more appropriate rating structure as well as credit scoring as permitted by local law and point of sale underwriting tools 
the order of integration had been prioritized such that the states with the most need for profit improvement migrated to national first 
all meridian nonstandard auto new business is now being written through the state auto nonstandard segment 
the business that remains within the meridian nonstandard segment is expected to decrease given this segment s historically low retention rate as well as the company continuing to take appropriate rate increases 
fourth quarter earned premiums for the meridian nonstandard segment comprised of total consolidated earned premiums versus in the same period 
consequently  beginning with the first quarter  the meridian nonstandard auto business will be included in the state auto nonstandard segment category 
net investment income increased by million in contributing to the increase over the previous year was an increase in invested assets due to a transfer of million in cash and fixed maturity securities from mutual to the pooled subsidiaries in the second half of this transfer was made in conjunction with the changes made to the pooled subsidiaries participation in the pooling arrangement  as more fully described above 
total cost of invested assets at december  and  was  million and  million  respectively 
reflecting a decline in the interest rate environment  the investment yields  based on cash equivalents  fixed and equity securities at cost were and for the annual periods ending and  respectively 
see further discussion regarding investments at the liquidity and capital resources  investments and market risk sections  included herein 
management services income  including investment management fees  decreased by million in this decrease was attributable to the termination of the fee element of the management agreement 
the service fee under the management agreement paid by mutual in was million 
see liquidity and capital resources included herein  for discussion of the overall impact of the loss of the management and operations service fee on the company s cash flow and operations 
consolidated losses and loss adjustment expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums the gaap loss and lae ratio  were and for the years and  respectively 
comparison of the overall results of with those of was affected by the addition of the former meridian mutual business to the pooling arrangement 
since the former meridian mutual business was added to the pooling arrangement effective july   it negatively impacted the loss results of the company only in the second half of however  in the results of the former meridian mutual business were included in and negatively impacted the results of the pooling arrangement for the entire year 
comparison of the overall results of with those of is also affected by the reserve strengthening that occurred during the second half of with respect to the meridian segments 
while the meridian standard business continues to produce loss results poorer than the state auto book of business see table of gaap loss and lae ratios operating segments below  management believes there has been improvement in the performance of the meridian segments due to the continuing efforts to improve pricing and risk selection applicable to these segments during during the quarters ended september  and june   the pooled companies produced a pool loss and lae ratio under the stop loss described above that exceeded the threshold  thereby recovering from mutual million and million in losses  respectively total of million for the year ended december  
in the quarters ended december  and march   the pooled companies pool loss and lae ratio was less than  but more than  page thereby ceding to mutual  under the stop loss million and million in earned premiums  respectively total of million for the year ended december  
the cession activity through the stop loss had the effect of lowering the gaap loss and lae ratio by and points in and  respectively 
the year was the worst catastrophe year in the history of the company on a dollar loss basis and third worst in terms of gaap loss and lae ratio points 
during the second quarter of  a series of tornadoes and hailstorms went through several of the company s operating states  including an f tornado in la plata  maryland 
this storm was the largest single catastrophe event for the company in  accounting for gaap loss and lae ratio points 
overall  catastrophe losses in were gaap loss and lae ratio points higher than in for discussion purposes  the following table provides comparative gaap loss and lae ratios for the company s insurance operating segments for the and periods  respectively  except for the meridian segments for  which is for the six month period ended december  gaap loss and lae ratio state auto standard segment state auto nonstandard segment meridian standard segment meridian nonstandard segment total gaap loss and lae ratio the state auto standard segment gaap loss and lae ratio increased in to from in catastrophe losses represented points of this segment s loss results for compared to points for with the significant increase in new business policy count came an increase in claim submissions 
while general inflation has been relatively modest for the past several years  price inflation on goods and services for which insurance pays  such as medical care and repairs to automobiles and buildings  exceeded the rate of overall inflation and adversely impacted the gaap loss and lae ratio 
the company has reacted to this inflationary trend by filing more aggressive  cost based  rate increases 
also contributing to the current year deterioration in the gaap loss and lae ratio was restrictions on the use of credit scoring in some states where the company does business 
to the extent these limitations result in higher loss ratios  the actuarial rate indications will increase resulting in larger rate increases being sought 
the company is also reviewing its credit scoring models to ensure that the premium rate derived from the model continues to accurately reflect the loss experience associated with each particular credit score range 
representing approximately of this segment s business  personal automobile has over the last five years yielded loss results better than industry average and in fact  has produced combined ratios of less than 
while the current year results are expected again to better industry average  this line of business did experience deterioration in its current year loss ratio  specifically within the auto liability and no fault lines  which management believes is due at least in part to increasing rates of inflation applicable to the health care sector of the us economy and an increased volume of new business  as noted above 
adverse loss results on workers compensation  commercial multi peril and other liability lines of business  which collectively represents approximately of this segment s business  also contributed to the current year loss result increase 
the company is taking substantial and necessary rate increases in rate per exposure across these lines of business 
workers compensation continues to be one of the most volatile lines that the company provides and for this reason the company has always maintained a particularly conservative posture on pricing in this line 
the state auto nonstandard segment gaap loss and lae ratio increased in to from in this segment experienced more volatility in  especially in those states experiencing substantial premium growth due to policy count increases 
as described above  contributing to this growth has been the addition of national s product to agents who wrote the former meridian mutual s nonstandard auto business 
while nonstandard automobile tends to be a more volatile line of business than standard automobile  management continually monitors this segment s premium rate adequacy 
management has been paying particular attention to the adequacy of these rates in these growth states  as well as risks page written in certain agencies  and is reacting accordingly by increasing rates and working with those agencies regarding risk selection 
the meridian standard segment gaap loss and lae ratio for was compared to for the six month period ended december  comparison of the overall results of with those of is affected by the reserve strengthening that occurred during the second half of within this segment 
catastrophe losses represent approximately points of this segment s loss results for both the and periods 
while the meridian standard business continues to produce loss results worse than the state auto book of business  management believes there has been improvement in this segment due to the necessary and continued efforts that began in  eg seeking adequate cost based rates  re underwriting commercial renewals to be certain that risks written are within the state auto underwriting guidelines and discontinuing the group advantage r program 
the meridian non standard segment gaap loss ratio for was compared to for the six month period ended december  this segment was also significantly impacted by case reserve strengthening that occurred during the second half of similar to the meridian standard segment  largely contributing to the current year loss results has been the substantial rate increases the company implemented in and acquisition and operating expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums the gaap expense ratio  were and for the years and  respectively 
management continually focuses its attention on improving its gaap expense ratio  which is especially critical during a period of substantial top line growth 
interest expense relates to the million line of credit agreement the company entered into with mutual in and the million surplus note agreement entered into with an affiliate on september  see additional discussion in the liquidity and capital resources section included herein 
the underwriting improvement  coupled with net investment income being largely comprised of tax exempt income  produced an effective tax expense rate in of versus an effective tax benefit of in for additional clarification  see the reconciliation between actual federal income taxes and the amount computed at the statutory rate as detailed in footnote in the notes to the company s consolidated financial statements 
compared to net income for the company decreased million in contributing to this decease was an increase in the company s gaap combined ratio to from in negatively impacting the company s insurance operations in were the loss results of the former meridian mutual business  assumed by the pooled subsidiaries beginning in july  and a decrease in the company s management and operations service fee income 
consolidated earned premiums increased million 
this increase was principally the result of the addition of the former meridian mutual business to the pooling arrangement  effective july   and a change in the pooled subsidiaries aggregate pooling participation percentage from to  effective october  these actions increased consolidated earned premiums 
the internal growth of the state auto standard segment s earned premiums increased consolidated earned premiums 
this increase has been largely driven by growth in commercial lines of business over the last twelve months  however  during the last half of the calendar year  personal lines of business began to experience sales increases 
management believes the personal lines sales increases are due to changes in the market place and to its establishing the position of personal lines sales specialist 
the internal growth of the state auto nonstandard segment earned premiums increased consolidated earned premiums 
production levels in this segment continued to improve during as a result of improved processing routines for agents and the easing of competitive pricing pressures it had felt from certain market leaders in the first half of the internal growth of both the meridian standard and nonstandard segment on consolidated earned premium was flat 
see discussion below regarding management s action during on the group advantage r program as well as management s page response to adequacy of premium rate levels within the standard segment and the company s plan on integration with regard to the meridian nonstandard segment 
net investment income increased million in contributing to the increase over the previous year was an increase in investable assets due to a transfer of cash and fixed maturity securities from mutual totaling million to the pooled subsidiaries in conjunction with the pooled subsidiaries assuming of the former meridian mutual business on july  and the change in the pooled subsidiaries pooling participation percentages  effective october   from to 
total cost of investable assets at december  and  was  million and million  respectively 
the investment yields  based on cash equivalents  fixed maturities and equity securities at cost  were and for the annual periods ending and  respectively 
during  the company experienced an increase in the number of calls over prior years on higher yielding fixed maturities 
monies from these calls were reinvested at lower rates 
see further discussion regarding investments at the liquidity and capital resources  investments and market risk sections  included herein 
management services income  including investment management fees  decreased million to million for the year ended december  this decrease was attributable to the resolution of the disagreement between the company and ohio department of insurance regarding the recognition of the service fee paid by mutual to state auto p c 
the service fee under the management agreement paid by mutual in was million down from million in see liquidity and capital resources included herein  for discussion of the overall impact of the loss of the management and operations service fee on the company s cash flow and operations 
losses and loss expenses increased million and as a percentage of earned premiums the gaap loss and lae ratio  were and for the years and  respectively 
during the fourth quarter of  the pooled subsidiaries produced a loss ratio under the stop loss described above that exceeded the threshold  thereby recovering the full layer of million from mutual 
adversely impacting the current year results were the loss results of the former meridian mutual business assumed by the pooled subsidiaries 
for discussion purposes  the following table provides comparative gaap loss and lae ratios for the company s insurance operating segments for the and periods  respectively  except for the meridian segments for  which is for the six month period ended december  gaap loss and lae ratio state auto standard segment state auto nonstandard segment meridian standard segment meridian nonstandard segment total gaap loss and lae ratio the company s state auto standard segment reflected an improvement in its gaap loss and lae ratio in to from in this segment s largest line of business  automobile  reflected a point improvement in from this segment s next largest line of business  homeowners  has experienced some deterioration in its gaap loss and lae ratio over the last several years 
management has been monitoring this line of business and has taken some corrective action through rate increases and improved underwriting techniques such as credit scoring 
the company s state auto nonstandard segment experienced an improvement in its gaap loss and lae ratio in to from in in  this segment began experiencing some volatility in loss activity in those states where national began operations in consequently  management began monitoring the premium rate adequacy in these new states and reacted accordingly throughout and by increasing rates in these new states 
additionally  this segment has implemented a number of underwriting tools  including point of sale underwriting as well as the use of credit scoring 
management believes these two tools have contributed to this segment s profit improvement 
page the former meridian mutual business has historically produced poorer loss results than the state auto book 
through the integration process  several areas within the meridian mutual book are being strengthened that should produce improved long term results 
the most notable improvement was management s focus on reviewing the meridian segments case reserves during the second half of to ensure that the claims were reserved in a manner consistent with state auto practices 
during the review  it became apparent that case reserves on the meridian segments for claims occurring in prior accident periods were not reserved consistently with historic state auto adequacy levels 
nearly  open claims were reviewed  adding approximately million to known case reserves on claims occurring in prior periods 
irrespective of this reserve strengthening  the meridian segments business continues to produce results that are not acceptable to management 
corrective action is taking place in both the standard and nonstandard segments 
group advantage r was a program within meridian s standard segment where meridian made its personal lines products available to sam s club members through insurance kiosks located in sam s club retail outlets 
while this program generated significant premium growth  it consistently failed to meet profitability objectives 
as a result  in late  the former meridian mutual stopped writing new group advantage r business and began to terminate existing business as permitted by law 
at the end of  there were approximately  group advantage r policies in force 
at year end  there are approximately of such policies in force 
these remaining policies are expected to non renew over the course of during  management also focused on strengthening the meridian standard segment s adherence to underwriting guidelines in a manner consistent with state auto practices  as well as analyzing the adequacy of prices relative to risks written 
consequently  management is in the process of re underwriting of the commercial renewals to be certain they fall within the state auto guidelines 
state auto also has a practice of reviewing the rate level for each line of business in each operating state each year 
concurrent with these reviews  the meridian standard segment s rate levels on its commercial book of business are being adjusted to the state auto rate level 
implementing the company s underwriting and pricing discipline within the meridian standard segment is anticipated to have an adverse effect on top line growth of the meridian standard segment 
this may be partially offset by new business being written within the state auto standard segment by those agencies previously representing the former meridian mutual but not state auto 
the meridian nonstandard segment produced significant underwriting losses generating a loss ratio for the six months ended december  of 
an integration plan is currently in place to write all new nonstandard auto business produced by former meridian agents through national on the national system platform 
the national system provides several enhancements that management anticipates will improve the nonstandard loss ratio for new risks written 
most notably  the national system uses credit scoring and point of sale underwriting tools 
the order of integration has been prioritized such that the states with the most need for profit improvement are migrating to national first 
new business for six of the states that the meridian nonstandard segment operates in is currently being written through national  with the remaining six states to follow throughout acquisition and operating expenses  as a percentage of earned premiums the gaap expense ratio  were and for the years and  respectively 
impacting the current year expenses was approximately million related to the company s estimate of its future guaranty fund assessments related to the reliance insurance company insolvency that was announced during the fourth quarter of interest expense relates to the line of credit agreement the company entered into with mutual during the second quarter of to assist in the funding of its stock repurchase program

page during  the company experienced an underwriting loss on its insurance operations  largely due to the loss results of the former meridian mutual business assumed by the pooled subsidiaries

the profits losses of these segments are monitored by management on an unconsolidated basis  as reflected in footnote  reportable segments  in the company s consolidated financial statements and therefore do not reflect adjustments for transactions with other segments or realized gains or losses on sales of investments

increased top line growth  as well as an increase in the state auto nonstandard segment s net investment income  despite deterioration in its loss results  contributed positively to this segment s profit in improvement in the company s segment profit within the state auto standard and nonstandard insurance segments was primarily due to an improvement in these segments loss experience and management s response to premium rate inadequacy as discussed at compared to in results of operations 
as discussed above  management continually monitors these segments premium rate adequacy and seeks adequate cost based rates 
comparison of the segment profit loss results of with that of for the meridian segments was affected by the reserve strengthening that occurred during the second half of while management recognizes that the meridian standard business continues to produce loss results poorer than the state auto standard segment  it believes its integration efforts that began in  as discussed at compared to  has improved this segment s results 
the increase in segment profit of the investment management segment in and was the result of this segment providing its services to the meridian insurers beginning june  this segment s revenue is based on the average fair value of the portfolio of the companies managed  which is largely comprised of fixed maturities 
during and  the investment management segment profit increased as managed invested assets increased 
as discussed above  beginning with the first quarter of  the management and operations services segment is now included in the all other category for segment reporting as the results of this segment no longer meet the quantitative thresholds for separate presentation as a reportable segment 
all other segment profits  including management and operations services  decreased in and the termination of the service fee under the management agreement was due to the resolution of the disagreement between the company and ohio department of insurance regarding the service fee page paid by mutual to the company in see discussion at compared to and compared to in results of operations

liquidity and capital resources liquidity refers to the ability of a company to generate adequate amounts of cash to meet its needs for both long and short term cash obligations as they come due 
the company s significant sources of cash are premiums  investment income and investments as they mature 
the company continually monitors its investment and reinsurance programs to ensure they are appropriately structured to enable the insurance subsidiaries to meet anticipated short and long term cash requirements without the need to sell investments to meet fluctuations in claim payments 
overall net cash provided by operating activities was million in  million in and million in the increase in is largely attributable to the prior year changes to the pooled subsidiaries participation in the pooling arrangement 
in the second half of  the pooled subsidiaries received cash of million and fixed maturities of million from mutual as a result of adding the meridian mutual business to the pooling arrangement and changing the pooling participation percentage of the pooled subsidiaries from to 
in there was a cash transfer of million to the pooled subsidiaries in connection with the amended pooling arrangement  as well as a cash transfer of million to state auto p c from mutual relating to the net pension and post retirement plan liabilities assumed by state auto p c relating to the transfer of employees of mutual as of january  prior to  state auto p c provided only executive management services to all insurance affiliates 
absent the impact of these transactions in and  net cash provided by operating activities was million and million  respectively 
over the last three years  operating cash flows have been sufficient to meet the operating needs of the company while providing opportunities for increased investment and financing needs 
the combination of the elimination of the relatively consistent cash flow from the management and operations services fee from mutual in along with significantly larger insurance segments is expected to result in more volatility going forward but will also provide opportunity for increased earnings and cash flows from operations 
overall net cash used in investing activities was million during  million in and million during the respective year s investing activity was reflective of the cash flow generated from operations discussed above 
during the company experienced fluctuating activity within its fixed maturity portfolio 
call activity in continued in response to the declines in the interest rate environment 
while the company continued to focus its attention on improving the loss results of the meridian book of business  which has put upward pressure on the company s overall loss experience in recent years  the company increased its sale activity of its fixed maturities in an effort to increase its taxable position in its investment portfolio 
monies generated from the call and sale activity have been reinvested at lower yielding rates 
cash provided by financing activities consists of proceeds from issuance of debt and common stock and cash used to acquire treasury shares and pay dividends to shareholders 
overall net cash provided by financing activities was million in  million in and  in net cash provided by financing activities increased during primarily due to net proceeds from issuance of debt see discussion below  partly offset by payments to re purchase company common shares 
during net cash provided by financing activities increased due to an increase in net proceeds from issuance of common stock over mutual  whose ownership in state auto financial is approximately  has waived its right to receipt of the dividends declared by state auto financial since in an effort to enhance the statutory surplus of the insurance subsidiaries of state auto financial for use in support of underwriting operations which in turn is expected to increase the statutory surplus of mutual 
in years before  prior to the declaration of each dividend by state auto financial  mutual s directors reviewed the facts and circumstances then present in deciding whether to waive such dividend 
beginning in  the issue of the waiver of mutual s dividend on its shares of state auto financial was referred to the independent committee of the board of directors of mutual 
it met and determined that it would review dividend waiver page decisions on an annual basis 
for the year  this committee of mutual s board of directors decided to waive mutual s dividends that might be declared by the board of directors of state auto financial for in order to take better advantage of the investment opportunity state auto financial represents for mutual 
in  once again this matter was referred to the independent committee of the mutual board which determined to waive mutual s right to receipt of dividends declared by state auto financial for the year impacting cash provided by financing activities during  and was state auto financial s board of directors approving plans to repurchase shares of its common stock from the public 
in march  the board of directors of state auto financial approved a plan to repurchase up to million shares of its common stock from the public over a period extending to december  during  the company repurchased  shares from the public for a total of million 
impacting cash used in financing activities during and was a stock repurchase plan approved to purchase up to million of state auto financial s common stock from the public ending december  the repurchase plan 
in and  the company repurchased approximately  shares each year from the public for a total of million and million  respectively 
in conjunction with a repurchase plan  state auto financial entered into a line of credit agreement with mutual for million 
the interest rate is adjustable annually on each january to reflect adjustments in the then current prime lending rate as well as state auto financial s current financial position 
the interest rate was  and for  and  respectively 
beginning january   the interest rate on this credit agreement will be 
commencing in  principal is due upon demand  with final payment to be received on or prior to december  effective september   milbank entered into a million surplus contribution note with meridian security 
subject to the condition described below and other terms of the note  the maturity date is september  the interest rate is equal to the us treasury ten year note yield at september  plus basis points and is adjustable october   to the then current us treasury ten year note yield plus basis points for the remaining term of the note 
interest is accrued  but all payments of principal or interest may be made only with the prior written approval of the south dakota director of insurance  milbank s domiciliary state 
interest is scheduled to be paid semiannually in arrears beginning march  the purpose of this surplus contribution note was to lower milbank s net written premium to statutory surplus ratio the leverage ratio 
the increase in milbank s leverage ratio resulted from an unusual rate of written premium growth over the last eighteen months due to a combination of increased top line growth and an increase in the company s pooling participation percentage  effective october  milbank s pooling percentage increased from to  as well as the addition of the former meridian mutual business to the pooling arrangement  effective july  also affecting its leverage ratio had been the increased losses sustained by the company during the period of transition of the former meridian mutual book of business 
at december   milbank s leverage ratio is to effective december   state auto financial entered into a day million term loan note agreement with a bank 
interest adjusts quarterly and accrues based on libor plus basis points at december  
interest on the note is through march  and for the period march  through september  the purpose of this term loan note was to contribute additional capital to state auto p c to improve this company s leverage ratio 
the reason for the increase in state auto p c s leverage ratio is similar to that of milbank s  which is described above 
state auto p c s pooling percentage increased from to  effective october  at december   state auto p c s leverage ratio is to at december   national s leverage ratio is to compared to to at december  the increase in the leverage ratio is the result of this company s substantial current year net written premium growth 
management believes the leverage ratios for milbank  state auto p c and national are higher than is optimal 
management is in the process of considering alternatives and developing a plan to improve these ratios 
it is likely there will be a cost to the company attendant to generating additional surplus within these three insurance subsidiaries  but no details are known at this time

risk based capital is a formula that attempts to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  loss reserve adequacy and other business factors 
applying the risk based capital requirements as of december   each of the state auto insurance companies surpassed all standards established by the formula 
the state auto insurance companies are participants in a catastrophe reinsurance program 
the amount retained by the state auto insurance companies is million for each occurrence 
for up to million in losses  excess of million  traditional reinsurance coverage is provided 
state auto p c assumes catastrophe reinsurance from mutual  milbank  sa wisconsin  farmers casualty  sa ohio  national  mid plains and the meridian insurers  in the amount of million excess of million 
this layer of million in excess of million has been excluded from the pooling arrangement 
there have been no losses assumed under this agreement 
to provide funding if the state auto insurance companies were to incur catastrophe losses in excess of million  state auto financial has continued a structured contingent financing transaction with a financial institution and a syndicate of other lenders the lenders to provide up to million for reinsurance purposes 
in the event of such a loss  this arrangement provides that state auto financial would sell redeemable preferred shares to saf funding corporation  a special purpose company spc  which would borrow the money necessary for such purchase from the lenders 
state auto financial would then contribute to state auto p c the funds received from the sale of its preferred shares 
state auto p c would use the contributed capital to pay its direct catastrophe losses and losses assumed under the catastrophe reinsurance agreement 
state auto financial is obligated to repay spc which would repay the lenders by redeeming the preferred shares over a five year period 
in the event of a default by state auto financial  the obligation to repay spc has been secured by a put agreement among state auto financial  mutual and the lenders  under which mutual would be obligated to either purchase the preferred shares from the spc or repay the spc for the loan s outstanding 
state auto p c s december  liability for losses and loss expenses of million has been guaranteed by mutual 
pursuant to the guaranty agreement  all ultimate adverse development of the december  liability  if any  is to be reimbursed by mutual to state auto p c in conformance with pooling percentages in place at that time 
as of december   there has been no adverse development of the liability 
on march   the board of directors of state auto financial declared a quarterly cash dividend of per common share  payable on march   to shareholders of record on march  this is the th consecutive cash dividend declared by state auto financial s board since state auto financial had its initial public offering of common stock on june  state auto financial has increased cash dividends to shareholders for eleven consecutive years 
the maximum amount of dividends that may be paid to state auto financial during by its insurance subsidiaries without prior approval under current law is limited to million 
the company is required to notify the insurance subsidiaries respective state insurance commissioner within five business days after declaration of all dividends and at least ten days prior to payment 
additionally  the domiciliary commissioner of each insurer subsidiary has the authority to limit a dividend when the commissioner determines  based on factors set forth in the law  that an insurer s surplus is not reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate to its financial needs 
such restrictions are not expected to limit the capacity of state auto financial to meet its cash obligations 
as discussed above  there was particular emphasis throughout and on improving the former meridian mutual book of business  which is expected to continue in the company believes its underwriting and pricing discipline  as well as its commitment to delivering its products as effectively and efficiently as possible  have been key factors in the company s underwriting results over the last several years

ulae are those costs incurred in settling claims  such as in house processing costs  for which no identification can be made to specific claims 
alae and ulae comprise the loss expense portion of the total loss and loss expenses payable 
the risks and uncertainties inherent in the estimates include  but are not limited to  actual settlement experience different from historical data  trends  changes in business and economic conditions  court decisions creating unanticipated liabilities  ongoing interpretation of policy provisions by the courts  inconsistent decisions in lawsuits regarding coverage and additional information discovered before settlement of claims 
the company s results of operations and financial condition could be impacted  perhaps significantly  in the future if the ultimate payments required to settle claims vary from the liability currently recorded 
the preceding paragraphs briefly describe certain factors management considers in estimating the ultimate liability for losses and loss expenses 
with respect to the auto line of business  which represents almost half of the company s total reserves  the most significant external variable is legal developments 
as discussed in impact of significant external factors below  court decisions have a significant impact on the property and casualty insurance industry 
some of these decisions have a more prospective effect as  for example  when contract provisions relating to third party coverages are construed in ways not anticipated by the company 
other court decisions have more of a retroactive effect  in particular in the auto insurance line 
auto insurance tends to be a line of business more regulated by statutes  consequently  the courts tend to have more of an opportunity to construe these statutes and apply their interpretations to existing contracts 
uninsured motorists and underinsured motorists collectively um are statutory coverages in almost every state page where the company does business 
when courts construe um statutes in a manner which is adverse to the company and the industry  the effect of that decision is typically retroactive  because  legally speaking when the court interprets a statute it is as though the statute was always construed in that manner 
this retroactive effect is exacerbated in um cases and other first party coverage cases because the statute of limitations applicable to um claims and other first party coverages can be as long as years 
claims that had been closed or not even presented  going back as long as years  can be re born by an adverse court decision 
the company considers the impact of adverse court decisions of which it has become aware when it sets ultimate loss and lae reserves for auto insurance as well as other lines to the extent those lines may be retroactively affected by such matters 
the effect of court decisions is also apparent in the commercial lines of coverages such as commercial multi peril and other liability and products liability 
courts can expand coverage or void exclusions which can increase the company s exposure to claims 
some of these third party claims may still be brought within the statute of limitations applicable to such third party claims and expose the company to some retroactive liabilities 
these liabilities are sought to be addressed by the ultimate loss and lae reserve that is the company s estimate of loss and loss expenses payable 
it is not feasible to quantify the impact of judicial decisions by the courts that may have retroactive effect because the company cannot foresee  among the range of issues that are litigated every day in courts in each state in which the company does business  which cases will be decided adversely and how such decisions will actually apply to the company 
the following table presents the loss and loss expenses payable by major line of business at december  and  respectively change dollars in thousands automobile standard   automobile nonstandard   homeowners and farmowners   commercial multi peril   workers compensation   fire and allied lines   other liability and products liability   other personal lines  other commercial lines   total losses and loss expenses payable  net of reinsurance recoverable on losses and loss expenses payable of  and    respectively overall total net losses and loss expenses payable increased from this increase is primarily driven by an increase in claim submissions  as the policy count base grew significantly during the year 
as shown in the table  the other commercial lines payable percentage increase is greater than the average increase for all lines 
we believe this is due to higher than average growth in commercial lines  and several unusually large claims incurred during overall  management does not believe there is a significant change in the total book of business at december  compared to december  unlike  where the company s loss and loss expenses incurred increased by million for claims that occurred in prior years primarily as the result of case reserve strengthening on meridian claims  in  loss and losses expenses incurred increased million of december  page net loss and loss expense payable 
the current year development of the prior years ultimate liability does not reflect any changes in the company s fundamental claims reserving practices 
a tabular presentation of the current year million development broken down by accident year is shown below derived from the company s and  year loss development tables  as presented in the reserves section of the company s form k  narrative description of business section 
the development is measured in dollars and as a percentage of the total december  net loss and loss expense payable current year percentage of development of ultimate total net loss accident liability and year redundancy loss expenses deficiency payable dollars in thousands and prior  total  in management s opinion  the current year development  given the breakdown by accident year  is well within normal expectations for reserve development and claim settlement uncertainty 
new accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statements of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  statements 
under the new rules  goodwill will no longer be amortized but will be subject to impairment tests in accordance with the statements 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
effective january   the company implemented the new rules in accordance with the statements 
as part of the implementation  the company performed the requisite transitional impairment tests for goodwill 
the adoption of the statements did not materially impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
impact of significant external factors inflation can have a significant impact on property and casualty insurers because premium rates are established before the amount of losses and loss expenses are known 
when establishing rates  the company attempts to anticipate increases from inflation subject to the limitations of modeling economic variables 
general inflation  as measured by the cpi  has been relatively modest over the last several years  however price inflation on the goods and services purchased by insurance companies in settling claims has been steadily increasing 
in particular  repair costs for homes  autos  and commercial buildings  and medical care costs  have risen over the last few years 
we continue to adjust our pricing projections as loss cost trends change to ensure premiums keep pace with inflation in all lines of business 
page the company considers inflation when estimating liabilities for losses and loss expenses  particularly for claims having a long period between occurrence and settlement 
the liabilities for losses and loss expenses are management s best estimates of the ultimate net cost of underlying claims and expenses and are not discounted for the time value of money 
in times of high inflation  the normally higher yields on investment income may partially offset potentially higher claims and expenses 
the company is also affected by court decisions 
premiums rates are actuarially determined to enable an insurance company to generate an underwriting profit 
these rates contemplate a certain level of risk 
the courts may modify  in a number of ways  the level of risk which insurers had expected to assume including eliminating exclusions  multiplying limits of coverage  creating rights for policyholders not intended to be included in the contract and interpreting applicable statutes expansively to create obligations on insurers not originally considered when the statute was passed 
courts have also undone legal reforms passed by legislatures  which reforms were intended to reduce a litigant s rights of action or amounts recoverable and so reduce the costs borne by the insurance mechanism 
these court decisions can adversely affect an insurer s profitability 
they also create pressure on rates charged for coverages adversely affected and this can cause a legislative response resulting in rate suppression that can adversely affect an insurer

as insurers write new business the database is accessed to analyze any loss experience of the insured  vehicle and or property location 
many times insurer s premium rates will be adjusted to reflect the loss experience accessed from these databases 
in some cases the overall acceptability of the insured s application in the standard market may be determined by these reports 
during  use of this loss information database product by the insurance industry as a predictive underwriting tool has been challenged by several west coast states and most recently in a few of the company s states of operation 
while it is too soon to determine states reaction to the utilization of these database systems  any restrictive regulation of the full use of these underwriting reports could have an adverse impact on the company as it has utilized these database systems for several years as an underwriting tool 
since such regulation is applicable to all companies writing business which utilize these reports the company does not expect to suffer a competitive disadvantage

in addition  other companies in the insurance industry have similar acquisition strategies 
there can be no assurance that any future acquisitions will be successfully integrated into the company s operations  that competition for acquisitions will not intensify or that the company will be able to complete such acquisitions on acceptable terms and conditions

in addition  although premium rate regulation varies among states and lines of insurance  such regulations generally require approval of the regulatory authority prior to any changes in rates 
furthermore  all of the states in which the state auto group transacts business have enacted laws which restrict these companies underwriting discretion 
examples of these laws include restrictions on agency terminations and laws page requiring companies to accept any applicant for automobile insurance and laws regulating underwriting tools
