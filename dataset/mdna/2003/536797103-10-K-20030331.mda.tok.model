item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a leading operator of automotive franchises and retailer of new and used vehicles and services 
as of march   we offered brands of new vehicles through franchises in stores in the western united states and over the internet 
as of march   we operate stores in oregon  in california  in washington  in texas  in idaho  in colorado  in nevada  in south dakota  in alaska and in nebraska 
we sell new and used cars and light trucks  sell replacement parts  provide vehicle maintenance  warranty  paint and repair services  and arrange related financing and insurance for our automotive customers 
during an economic downturn  customers tend to shift towards the purchase of more reasonably priced new vehicle models or used vehicles 
many customers decide to delay purchasing a new vehicle and instead repair existing vehicles 
in addition  manufacturers typically offer increased dealer and customer incentives during an economic downturn in order to support new vehicle sales volume 
these factors lead to less volatility in earnings for automobile retailers than for automobile manufacturers or auto parts suppliers 
historically  new vehicle sales have accounted for approximately to of our total revenues but less than of total gross profit 
we emphasize sales of higher margin products  which generate over of our gross profits 
our revenues and gross profit by product line were as follows for and percent of gross percent of total total revenues margin gross profit new vehicles retail used vehicles service  body and parts finance and insurance fleet and other excludes wholesale used vehicle sales  representing of total revenues  and a reduction in gross margin of

table of contents in  we reclassified documentation fees from finance and insurance income to new and used vehicle revenue  as appropriate  in order to bring our reporting in line with industry practice 
the resulting effect was a reduction of approximately per vehicle of finance and insurance income and an increase in new and retail used vehicle gross margins of between and basis points 
accordingly  the finance and insurance sales per retail unit  revenue by product line and gross margin percentage disclosures have been recalculated for prior periods to be consistent with the presentation 
net income was not affected by this reclassification

total revenues increased to record levels for compared to due to acquisitions and same store retail sales growth 
we achieved same store new vehicle sales growth of in compared to this compares favorably to industry decreases in new vehicle sales of for the same period 
these results were achieved through an aggressive company wide marketing campaign based on the driving america theme aimed at increasing market share in order to secure a long term customer base for all business lines 
the increase in new vehicle same store sales was augmented by same store increases in finance and insurance sales and were partially offset by decreases in same store used vehicle and service and parts sales 
the used vehicle business was weaker due to the strong new vehicle incentive environment 
the service and pats business has been negatively impacted in the past couple of years by substantial improvements in the quality of domestic vehicles  resulting in less warranty work 
during  manufacturers offered  and are continuing to offer  incentives  including low interest rates and rebates  in order to attract new vehicle buyers 
the availability of cash rebates and zero percent and low interest rate financing has also enhanced our ability to sell finance  warranty and insurance products and services 
our finance and insurance sales per retail unit increased to per retail vehicle in compared to gross profit 
gross profit increased due to increased total revenues  offset in part by a lower overall gross profit percentage 
certain incentives and rebates received from manufacturers  including floorplan interest credits  are recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold at the time of vehicle sale 
gross profit margins achieved were as follows year ended december  lithia margin change new vehicles bp retail used vehicles service and parts overall bp stands for basis points one hundred basis points equals one percent 
the decrease in the overall gross profit margin in compared to is primarily a result of four factors a significant shift towards our lowest margin new vehicle business with the strong incentive environment  lower floorplan interest credits from the manufacturers on new vehicles due to lower market rates  aggressive pricing of new vehicles in order to gain market share  which resulted in lower new vehicle margins  and 
table of contents a mix shift in used vehicle sales to the lower margin one to three year old vehicles  which have lower margins than the older used vehicles 
these factors were partially offset by an increase in the gross margin achieved in our parts and service business in compared to selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense includes salaries and related personnel expenses  facility lease expense  advertising  legal  accounting  professional services and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense increased due to increased selling  or variable  expenses related to the increase in revenues and the number of locations 
as a percentage of revenue  selling  general and administrative expense decreased basis points in compared to due to expense leverage on higher sales 
depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased primarily as a result of the adoption of sfas no

goodwill and other intangibles amortization expense totaled million in income from operations 
operating margins decreased basis points in compared to due to the decrease in the overall gross margin percentage  offset in part by lower operating expenses as a percentage of revenue 
floorplan interest expense 
the decrease in floorplan interest expense in compared to is primarily due to approximately million in savings as a result of decreases in the effective interest rates on the floating rate credit lines  offset in part by a million increase in expense as a result of an overall average increase in the outstanding balances of our floorplan facilities  mainly due to acquisitions 
in addition to the interest expense on our flooring lines of credit  floorplan interest expense includes the interest expense related to our interest rate swaps 
other interest expense 
other interest expense includes interest on debt incurred related to acquisitions  real estate mortgages  our used vehicle line of credit and equipment related notes 
the decrease in other interest expense resulted from million of savings due to lower interest rates in compared to and approximately million in savings due to the pay down of million on our lines of credit in march  following our equity offering 
these decreases were offset in part by less capitalized interest on construction projects in progress in compared to and by an increase in the outstanding balances due to acquisitions and the financing of previously unfinanced real estate during the lower interest rates in are due in part to the refinancing of million of fixed interest rate mortgage loans since november  utilizing floating rate loans with toyota motor credit and ford motor credit

total revenues increased to record levels for compared to due to acquisitions  which were partially offset by same store retail sales decreasing 
the decrease in same store retail sales was due to a slower new vehicle sales environment in the first three quarters of  offset in part by same store increases in used vehicle and finance and insurance sales 
during the fourth quarter of  manufacturers offered  and continued to offer in the first quarter of  incentives  including low interest rates and rebates  in order to attract new vehicle buyers 
these incentives  along with improvements in our core operations  contributed to same store sales growth of in the fourth quarter of compared to the fourth quarter of the availability of cash rebates and zero percent and low interest rate financing have also enhanced our ability to sell finance  warranty and insurance products and services 
gross profit

incentives and rebates  including floorplan interest credits  received from manufacturers are recorded as a reduction to cost of goods sold 
gross margin expansion is common in the

table of contents seasonality and quarterly fluctuations historically  our sales have been lower in the first and fourth quarters of each year due to consumer purchasing patterns during the holiday season  inclement weather and the reduced number of business days during the holiday season 
as a result  financial performance may be lower during the first and fourth quarters than during the other quarters of each fiscal year 
we believe that interest rates  levels of consumer debt and consumer confidence  as well as general economic conditions  also contribute to fluctuations in sales and operating results 
historically  the timing and frequency of acquisitions has been the largest contributor to fluctuations in our operating results from quarter to quarter 
liquidity and capital resources our principal needs for capital resources are to finance acquisitions and capital expenditures  as well as for working capital 
we have relied primarily upon internally generated cash flows from operations  borrowings under our credit agreements and the proceeds from public equity offerings to finance operations and expansion 
we believe that our available cash  cash equivalents  available lines of credit and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to meet our anticipated operating expenses and capital requirements for at least twelve months from december  in addition  we anticipate that these resources will be sufficient to fund our anticipated acquisitions through on may   we redeemed the remaining  outstanding shares of our series m preferred stock for a total of million from our existing cash balances 
in march  we registered and sold million newly issued shares of our class a common stock for total proceeds of approximately million  net of offering expenses of approximately million 
we utilized the proceeds to pay down our lines of credit until such funds are required for acquisitions 
our inventories increased to million at december  from million at december  due to acquisitions and higher inventory levels in a slowing sales environment 
in addition  our days supply of inventory at december  was to lower than historical year end levels due to the success of the introduction of zero percent financing in the fourth quarter of accordingly  our new and used flooring notes payable increased to million at december  from million at december  our land  buildings and equipment increased to million at december  from million at december  due to the acquisition of stores during these acquisitions also resulted in the increase in goodwill and other intangibles  which totaled million at december  compared to million at december  in june  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our class a common stock 
through march  we have purchased  shares under this program and may continue to do so from time to time in the future as conditions warrant 
in february we entered into a working capital and acquisition credit facility with daimlerchrysler services north america llc totaling up to million  which expires in february  with interest due monthly 

table of contents our previous facility with ford motor credit company was terminated and paid off on february  we were in compliance with all covenants under this facility at december  the credit line with daimlerchrysler services is cross collateralized and secured by cash and cash equivalents  new and used vehicle and parts inventories  accounts receivable  intangible assets and equipment 
we pledged to daimlerchrysler services the stock of all of our subsidiaries except entities operating bmw  honda  nissan or toyota stores 
the financial covenants in our agreement with daimlerchrysler services require us to maintain compliance with  among other things  i a specified current ratio  ii a specified fixed charge coverage ratio  iii a specified interest coverage ratio  iv a specified adjusted leverage ratio  and v certain working capital levels 
toyota motor credit corporation  ford motor credit and general motors acceptance corporation have agreed to floor all of our new vehicles for their respective brands with daimlerchrysler services serving as the primary lender for substantially all other brands 
these new vehicle lines are secured by new vehicle inventory of the relevant brands 
we also have a real estate line of credit with toyota motor credit totaling million  which expires in may this line of credit is secured by the real estate financed under this line of credit 
in addition  us bank us has extended a million revolving line of credit for leased vehicles and equipment purchases  which expires january interest rates on all of the above facilities ranged from to at december  amounts outstanding on the lines at december  together with amounts remaining available under such lines were as follows in thousands outstanding at remaining availability as december  of december  new and program vehicle lines used vehicle line acquisition line real estate line equipment leased vehicle line there are no formal limits on the new and program vehicle lines with certain lenders 
at december   our long term debt and lease commitments were as follows in thousands long term year ending december  debt leases total thereafter total 
table of contents at december   we had capital commitments of approximately million for the construction of three new store facilities  additions to three existing facilities and the remodel of three facilities 
the three new facilities will be a ford store in boise  idaho  a body shop in aurora  colorado and a body shop in boise  idaho 
we have already incurred million for these commitments and anticipate incurring the remaining million during we expect to pay for the construction out of existing cash balances until completion of the projects  at which time we anticipate securing long term financing and general borrowings from third party lenders for to of the amounts expended 
critical accounting policies service contract and lifetime oil contract income recognition we receive fees from the sale of vehicle service contracts and lifetime oil contracts to customers 
the contracts are sold through an unrelated third party  but we may be charged back for a portion of the fees in the event of early termination of the contracts by customers 
we have established a reserve for estimated future charge backs based on an analysis of historical charge backs in conjunction with termination provisions of the applicable contracts 
at december   this reserve totaled million and is included in accrued liabilities and other long term liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
finance fee income recognition we receive finance fees from various financial institutions when we arrange financing for our customers on a non recourse basis 
we may be charged back for a portion of the financing fee income when the customer pays off their loan prior to the guidelines agreed to by the various financial institutions 
we have established a reserve for potential charge backs based on historical experience  which typically result if the customer pays off their loan during the to days after receiving financing 
at december   this reserve totaled  and is included in accrued liabilities on our consolidated balance sheet 
workers compensation insurance premium accrual insurance premiums are paid for under a retrospective cost policy  whereby premium cost depends on experience 
we accrue premiums based on our historical experience rating  although the actual experience can be something greater or less than the anticipated claims experience 
we expect that the retrospective cost policy  as opposed to a guaranteed cost with a flat premium  will be the most cost efficient over time 
intangible assets we review our goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets at least annually by applying a fair value based test using the discounted estimated cash flows for the reporting unit 
discounted future cash flows are prepared by applying a growth rate to historical revenues 
growth rates are calculated individually for each region with data derived from the us census bureau on population growth and the us department of labor  bureau of labor statistics for historical consumer price index data 
the discount rate applied to the future cash flows is derived from a capital asset pricing model which factors in an equity risk premium and a risk free rate 
the review is conducted more frequently than annually if events or circumstances occur that warrant a review of the fair value of a reporting unit 
our other identifiable intangible assets include the franchise value of the business units  which is considered to have an indefinite life and not subject to amortization  but rather is included in the fair value based testing 
impairment could occur if the operating business unit does not meet the determined fair value testing 
at such point  an impairment loss would be 
table of contents recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the assets fair value 
during  we concluded that there was no impairment 
goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets totaled million at december  used vehicle inventory used vehicle inventories are stated at cost plus the cost of any equipment added  reconditioning and transportation 
we select a sampling of dealerships throughout the year to perform quarterly testing of book values against market valuations utilizing the kelly blue book and nada guidelines 
used vehicle inventory values are cyclical and could experience impairment when market valuations are significantly below inventory costs 
historically  we have not experienced significant write downs on our used vehicle inventory 
recent accounting pronouncements see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk variable rate debt we use variable rate debt to finance our new and program vehicle inventory 
the interest rate on the flooring debt is tied to either the one month libor  the three month libor or the prime rate 
these debt obligations therefore expose us to variability in interest payments due to changes in these rates 
the flooring debt is based on open ended lines of credit tied to each individual store from the various manufacturer finance companies 
if interest rates increase  interest expense increases 
conversely  if interest rates decrease  interest expense decreases 
our variable rate flooring notes payable and other credit line borrowings subject us to market risk exposure 
at december   we had million outstanding under such agreements at interest rates ranging from to per annum 
a increase in interest rates would increase annual interest expense by approximately  net of tax  based on amounts outstanding on the lines of credit at december  hedging strategies we believe it is prudent to limit the variability of a portion of our interest payments 
accordingly  we have entered into interest rate swaps to manage the variability of our interest rate exposure  thus leveling a portion of our interest expense in a rising or falling rate environment 
including all four of the swaps listed below  we currently have hedged approximately of our new vehicle flooring debt 
including the four swaps and other fixed rated debt obligations  approximately of our total debt has fixed rates 
the interest rate swaps change the variable rate cash flow exposure on a portion of the flooring debt to fixed rate cash flows by entering into receive variable  pay fixed interest rate swaps 
under the interest rate swaps  we receive variable interest rate payments and make fixed interest rate payments  thereby creating fixed rate flooring debt 

table of contents we have entered into the following interest rate swaps with us bank dealer commercial services effective september  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  effective november  a three year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of per annum  effective january  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of  and effective february  a five year  million interest rate swap at a fixed rate of 
we earn interest on all of the interest rate swaps at the one month libor rate 
the september   the november  and the february  swaps are adjusted on the first and sixteenth of every month and we are obligated to pay interest at the fixed rate set for each swap on the same amount 
the january  swap is adjusted once a month on the th of each month and we are obligated to pay interest at the fixed rate set 
the difference between interest earned and the interest obligation accrued is received or paid each month and is recorded in the statement of operations as flooring interest expense 
the one month libor rate at december  was per annum 
we do not enter into derivative instruments for any purpose other than to manage interest rate exposure 
that is  we do not speculate using derivative instruments 
the fair value of interest rate swap agreements and the amount of hedging losses deferred on interest rate swaps was million at december  changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are reported  net of related income taxes  in accumulated other comprehensive income 
these amounts are subsequently reclassified into interest expense as a yield adjustment in the same period in which the related interest on the flooring debt affects earnings 
because the critical terms of the interest rate swaps and the underlying debt obligations are the same  there was no ineffectiveness recorded in interest expense 
incremental interest expense  net of tax  incurred as a result of the interest rate swaps was million in at current interest rates  we estimate that we will incur additional interest expense  net of tax  of approximately million related to our interest rate swaps during risk management policies we assess interest rate cash flow risk by continually identifying and monitoring changes in interest rate exposures that may adversely impact expected future cash flows and by evaluating hedging opportunities 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor interest rate cash flow attributable to both our outstanding and our forecasted debt obligations as well as our offsetting hedge positions 
the risk management control systems involve the use of analytical techniques  including cash flow sensitivity analysis  to estimate the expected impact of changes in interest rates on our future cash flows 

table of contents as of december   prior to entering into the two new swap agreements in  approximately of our total debt outstanding was subject to un hedged variable rates of interest 
as a result  interest rate declines during have resulted in a net reduction of our interest expense for compared to what it would have been at similar debt levels with no interest rate decline 
we intend to continue to gradually hedge our interest rate exposure if market rates continue to decline
