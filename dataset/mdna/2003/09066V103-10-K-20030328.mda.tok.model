item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations elsewhere in this report 
competition the primary competitive embolotherapy product is polyvinyl alcohol  or pva  a product introduced into the market more than years ago 
we encounter  and expect to continue to encounter  competition in the sale of our current and future embolotherapy products 
our principal competitors in the field of embolotherapy are boston scientific corporation  cook incorporated and cordis corporation a johnson johnson company  as well as companies selling or developing non embolotherapy solutions for the disease states targeted by us 
these competitors have  and our future competitors are likely to have  greater financial  operational  sales and marketing resources and more experience in research and development than we have 
we compete primarily on the basis of product performance  ease of use  degree of targeted embolization control  and quality of patient outcome 
government regulation fda regulation 
the fda  and other federal  state  local  and foreign authorities  regulate our products and manufacturing activities 
pursuant to the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act and the regulations promulgated thereunder  the fda regulates the development  clinical testing  manufacture  packaging  labeling  storage  distribution and promotion of medical devices 
before a new device can be introduced into the market  the manufacturer must generally obtain marketing clearance through a k notification or approval through a premarket approval application 
we generally will be required to obtain k clearance or premarket approval prior to commercial distribution of future products or additional applications of current products 
changes in approved devices 
device manufacturers must obtain new fda k clearance when there is a major change or modification in the intended use of a legally marketed device or a change or modification  including product enhancements  to a legally marketed device that could significantly affect its safety or effectiveness 
for devices marketed pursuant to k determinations of substantial equivalence  we must obtain fda clearance of a new k notification prior to marketing the modified device 
good manufacturing practices and reporting 
the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act requires us to comply with good manufacturing practices or quality systems regulations 
we must comply with various quality control requirements pertaining to all aspects of our product design and manufacturing process  including requirements for packaging  labeling and record keeping  including complaint files 
the fda enforces these requirements through periodic inspections of medical device manufacturing facilities 
in addition  the medical device reporting regulation obligates us to inform the fda whenever information reasonably suggests that one of our devices may have caused or contributed to death or serious injury  or when one of our devices malfunctions  if the device would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or a serious injury in the event the malfunction recurred 
we believe we  and all of our contract manufacturers  are in compliance with applicable good manufacturing practices and quality systems regulations 
labeling and advertising 
labeling and promotional activities are also subject to scrutiny by the fda 
among other things  labeling is violative of the law if it is false or misleading in any respect or it fails to contain adequate directions for use 
moreover  claims that are outside the labeling either approved or cleared by the fda may violate the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act 
our product promotion is also subject to regulation by the federal trade commission under the federal trade commission act  which prohibits unfair methods of competition and unfair or deceptive acts or practices in or affecting commerce  as well as unfair or deceptive practices such as the dissemination of any false advertisement pertaining to medical devices 
import requirements 
to import a device  the importer must file an entry notice and bond with the us customs department pending an fda decision on the product s admissibility 
all devices are subject to fda examination before release from customs 
any article that appears to be in violation of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act may be refused admission and a notice of detention and hearing may be issued 
export requirements 
products for export from europe and from the united states are subject to foreign countries import requirements and the fda s or european regulating bodies exporting requirements 
in addition to the import requirements of foreign countries  we must also comply with the united states laws governing the export of products regulated by the fda 
however  foreign countries often require  among other things  an fda certificate for products for export 
to obtain this certificate  the device manufacturer must certify to the fda that the product has been granted clearance or approval in the united states and that the manufacturing facilities appeared to be in compliance with good manufacturing practices regulations at the time of the last fda inspection 
fines and penalties for noncompliance 
failure to comply with applicable fda regulatory requirements could result in  among other things  premarket clearance or approval withdrawal  injunctions  product withdrawals  voluntary or mandatory patient physician notifications  recalls  warning letters  product seizures  civil penalties  fines and criminal prosecutions 
federal trade commission enforcement can result in orders requiring  among other things  limits on advertising  corrective advertising  consumer redress  rescission of contracts and such other relief as may be deemed necessary 
medical device laws are also in effect in many countries outside of the united states 
these range from comprehensive device approval requirements for some or all of our medical device products to simpler requests for product data or certification 
the number and scope of these requirements are increasing 
sales of medical devices in the european union are subject to the european medical device directive 
this directive contains requirements for quality system and product performance guidelines with which all manufacturers must comply 
these guidelines contain quality system guidelines and preproduction product design verification that closely resemble current fda guidelines 
in  we obtained iso international quality systems registration  a certification showing that our procedures and manufacturing facilities comply with standards for quality assurance and manufacturing process control 
our compliance with this registration has been confirmed since in semi annual surveillance audits 
failure to comply with applicable federal  state and foreign medical device laws and regulations would likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  federal  state and foreign regulations regarding the manufacture and sale of medical devices are subject to future changes 
we are subject to various federal  state  local and foreign laws and regulations relating to the protection of the environment  as well as health and safety 
in the course of our business  we are involved in the handling  storage and disposal of certain chemicals 
the laws and regulations applicable to our operations include provisions that regulate the discharge of materials into the environment 
usually these environmental laws and regulations impose strict liability  rendering a person liable without regard to negligence or fault on the part of such person 
such environmental laws and regulations may expose us to liability for the conduct of  or conditions caused by  others  or for acts that were in compliance with all applicable laws at the time the acts were performed 
we do not believe that we have been required to expend material amounts in connection with our efforts to comply with environmental requirements or that compliance with such requirements will have a material adverse effect upon our capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
failure to comply with applicable environmental and related laws could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition  because the requirements imposed by such laws and regulations are frequently changed  we are unable to predict the cost of compliance with such requirements in the future  or the effect of such laws on our capital expenditures  results of operations or competitive position 
proprietary technology and patent rights we seek to establish and protect our proprietary technologies and products through a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secrets laws  as well as confidentiality provisions in our contracts 
we have implemented a patent strategy designed to maximize our intellectual property rights 
we are pursuing patent coverage in the united states and foreign countries to protect the technology  inventions and improvements that we consider critical to the development of our products and business 
in january  we entered into an agreement with l assistance publique hopitaux de paris  referred to as ap hp  pursuant to which ap hp has granted us the exclusive right to use two jointly owned patents relating to microspheres 
we are required to pay to ap hp a royalty on the commercial sale of any products that incorporate technology covered by the patents 
we may only sublicense these exclusive rights under the agreement with the prior written consent of ap hp  which consent cannot be unreasonably withheld 
the rights granted under the contract are for an initial period which ends on september   and are renewable by mutual agreement between the parties 
the agreement can be terminated on three months notice by either party if the other party does not perform one or more of its obligations under the agreement and fails to cure its nonperformance during the notice period 
these jointly owned patents will expire in in addition  as part of the sale of our former core business to invitrogen  inc  formerly know as life technologies  in may  we entered into a cross license agreement with invitrogen 
under that agreement  invitrogen has granted to us an exclusive  worldwide  perpetual  royalty free license to its technology and patents relating to our core field of development  including any improvement to that technology made prior to may under the agreement  we also granted to invitrogen an exclusive  worldwide  perpetual  royalty free license to any improvements to the technology they have licensed to us which are useful in invitrogen s fields of development 
either party can terminate the agreement  and all licenses granted thereunder  on sixty days notice in the event of a breach of the agreement by the other party 
in  we entered into an agreement with dr 
shinichi hori  pursuant to which we have an exclusive royalty bearing license to japanese patent rights for our hepasphere sap microsphere product 
these patent rights expire in there are no united states or other international filings corresponding to this patent application 
we intend to file patent applications directed to improvement of this inventor s technology 
however  present applications may not issue as patents  and these patents  if issued  may not provide us with sufficient protection against competitors 
further  we may be required to obtain additional licenses concerning the japanese patent application and any licenses  if obtained  may not be on terms that are acceptable to us 
in  we received a united states patent that is directed to the treatment of urinary incontinence using microparticles 
a related patent application was also awarded to us in  directed to the use of microspheres in dermal augmentation 
we have numerous us patent applications currently pending 
each of these files has a corresponding european application pending 
the subjects of the patents include new material for embolization  new uses of our material outside of embolization and new methods of using our material for embolization and other applications 
our success depends to a significant degree upon our ability to develop proprietary products and technologies and to obtain patent coverage for these products and technologies 
we intend to continue to file patent applications covering any newly developed products and technologies 
however  as discussed above  there can be no guarantee that any of our pending or future filed applications will be issued as patents 
there can be no guarantee that the united states patent and trademark office or some third party will not initiate an interference proceeding involving any of our pending applications or issued patents 
finally  there can be no guarantee that our issued patents or future issued patents  if any  will provide adequate protection from competition  as further discussed below 
patents provide some degree of protection for our proprietary technology 
however  the pursuit and assertion of patent rights  particularly in areas like medical device development  involve complex legal and factual determinations and  therefore  are characterized by significant uncertainty 
in addition  the laws governing patent issuance and the scope of patent coverage continue to evolve  particularly in life sciences 
moreover  the patent rights we possess or are pursuing generally cover our technologies to varying degrees 
as a result  we cannot ensure that patents will issue from any of our patent applications or from applications licensed to us  or that any of our issued patents will offer meaningful protection 
in addition  our issued patents or patents licensed to us may be successfully challenged  invalidated  circumvented or rendered unenforceable so that our patent rights may not create an effective competitive barrier 
moreover  the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent  as do the laws of the united states 
there can be no assurance that any patents issued to us will provide a legal basis for establishing an exclusive market for our products or provide us with any competitive advantages  or that the patents of others will not have an adverse effect on our ability to do business or to continue to use our technologies freely 
in view of these factors  the value of our intellectual property position is uncertain 
we may be subject to third parties filing claims asserting that our technologies or products infringe on their intellectual property 
we cannot predict whether third parties will assert such claims against us or our licensees or against the licensors of technology licensed to us  or whether those claims will harm our business 
if we are forced to defend against such claims  regardless of their merit or whether they are resolved in favor of or against us  our licensees or our licensors  we may face costly litigation and diversion of management s attention and resources 
as a result of such disputes  we may have to develop  at a substantial cost  non infringing technology  or enter into licensing agreements 
these agreements  if necessary  may be unavailable on terms acceptable to us  or at all  which could seriously harm our business or financial condition 
we also rely in part on trade secret protection of our intellectual property 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets by entering into confidentiality agreements with third parties  employees and consultants 
our employees also sign agreements requiring that they assign to us their interests in inventions and original expressions and any corresponding patents and copyrights arising from their work for us 
however  it is possible that these agreements may be breached  invalidated or rendered unenforceable  and  if so  our trade secrets could be disclosed to others  including our competitors  and there may not be an adequate corrective remedy available 
despite the measures we have taken to protect our intellectual property  parties to our agreements may breach the confidentiality provisions in our contracts or infringe or misappropriate our patents  copyrights  trademarks  trade secrets and other proprietary rights 
in addition  third parties may independently discover or invent competitive technologies  or reverse engineer our trade secrets or other technology 
therefore  the measures we are taking to protect our proprietary technology may not be adequate 
employees as of february   we employed persons 
of these employees  are primarily engaged in research  development and clinical activities  are engaged in manufacturing  are engaged in sales and marketing  and the remainder are engaged in finance and administration 
of these persons  are located in the united states  are located in france and is located in japan 
our employees in the united states are not covered by a collective bargaining agreement 
in europe  our employees are covered by the provisions of an agreement setting forth national guidelines and standards for labor relations within our industry 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
risk factors that may affect future operating results this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
for this purpose  any statements contained herein that are not statements of historical fact may be considered to be forward looking statements 
although not a complete list of words that might identify forward looking statements  we use the words believes  anticipates  plans  expects  intends  and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
there are a number of important factors that could cause our actual results to differ materially from those indicated by forward looking statements 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include those discussed below  as well as those discussed elsewhere in this form k 
we expressly disclaim any obligation to update or alter our forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
risk relating to our future profitability because we have a history of losses and our future profitability is uncertain  our common stock is a speculative investment we have incurred operating losses since our inception and  as of december   had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we expect to spend substantial funds to continue research and product testing  to establish sales  marketing  quality control  regulatory  manufacturing and administrative capabilities and for other general corporate purposes 
we expect to continue to incur operating losses until at least the fourth quarter of  as we expand our commercialization efforts 
we may never become profitable 
if we do become profitable  we may not remain profitable on a continuing basis 
our failure to become and remain profitable would depress the market price of our common stock and impair our ability to raise capital and expand  diversify or continue our operations 
risks relating to our industry  business and strategy if we do not achieve widespread market acceptance of our microspheres products  our business prospects will be seriously harmed our microspheres are based on new technologies and therapeutic approaches 
in the united states  we began selling our microspheres product in the first half of in november  we received fda clearance to market our microspheres in the united states for specific use in the embolization of uterine fibroids 
our success will depend upon the medical community s  patients and third party payors continued acceptance of our microspheres product as medically therapeutic and cost effective 
our future success will also depend upon obstetrics and gynecology physicians referring patients to interventional radiologists to receive treatment using our products in lieu of  or in addition to  receiving other forms of treatment that the obstetrics and gynecology physicians can otherwise provide directly 
negative publicity associated with any adverse medical effects attributed to embolization treatments generally  or our product specifically  may create the market perception that our products are unsafe 
for example  patients commonly experience a day or two of post procedure abdominal pain or cramping 
other infrequently occurring complications may include allergic reactions  rashes  early onset of menopause  infertility and infection that may  in some cases  require a hysterectomy 
in addition  our microspheres are designed to remain in the body permanently 
as a result  there is some risk that some or all of the microspheres used in a medical procedure may travel in the blood system beyond the intended surgical site and occlude  or block  other blood vessels  resulting in the potential for significant adverse health effects on the patient or  in a worst case  even death 
moreover  to use our microspheres correctly for a particular medical procedure  trained physicians must select and use the proper size and quantity 
a physician s selection and use of the wrong size or quantity of our microspheres could potentially have significant adverse health effects on the patient  including death 
it will be necessary for us to spend significant amounts of money and allocate management resources to educate physicians about the selection and use of the proper size and quantity of microspheres in patient therapy 
in addition  there is only limited data concerning the long term health effects on persons receiving embolotherapy using our microspheres 
if we are not able to successfully educate physicians to properly use our product  or if the market determines or concludes that our product is not safe or effective for any reason  we may be exposed to product liability claims  product recalls  fines or other penalties or enforcement actions by regulatory agencies and associated adverse publicity 
in addition  we have provided to our customers a satisfaction guarantee that requires us to accept the return of any inventory and credit the entire amount of the original order if a properly trained customer is not satisfied with the performance of either our microspheres or our embocath catheter products 
if we experience adverse publicity or are subject to product liability claims  excessive guarantee claims  recalls  fines and the like  we will be unable to achieve widespread market acceptance of our embosphere microsphere products and achieve profitability 
we will be required to expend significant resources for research  development  testing and regulatory approval of our products under development  and these products may not be developed successfully we are developing and commercializing products for medical applications using embolotherapy techniques 
most of our next generation embolotherapy product candidates are still in the early stages of research and development 
our products may not provide greater benefits than current treatments or products  or alternative treatments or products under development 
all of our products under development will require significant additional research  development  pre clinical and or clinical testing  regulatory approval and a commitment of significant additional resources prior to their commercialization 
our potential products may not be developed successfully  be proven safe and effective in clinical trials  offer therapeutic or other improvements over current treatments and products  meet applicable regulatory standards or receive regulatory approvals  be capable of production in commercial quantities at acceptable costs  or be successfully marketed 
if we do not develop and introduce new products  we may not achieve revenue opportunities we derived more than a majority of our revenues for the years ended december  and from the sale of embosphere microspheres and embogold microspheres 
in addition  although we did not receive fda clearance to market our microspheres for the specific use in the treatment of uterine fibroids until november  we believe that a majority of our revenues in the united states for the years ended december  and were derived from the sale of our microspheres for use in uterine fibroid embolization 
we derived approximately of our revenues for the year ended december   and of our revenues for the year ended december   from the sale of non strategic medical device products that we do not expect to constitute a significant portion of our revenues on an ongoing basis 
accordingly  we need to develop and introduce new applications for our embolotherapy technology and pursue opportunities for microsphere technology in other medical applications 
if we are not successful in developing new applications and products  we may not achieve revenue opportunities 
if we experience delays  difficulties or unanticipated costs in establishing the sales  distribution and marketing capabilities necessary to successfully commercialize our products  we will have difficulty maintaining and increasing our sales we are continuing to develop sales  distribution and marketing capabilities in the united states  the european union  the far east and in south america 
it is expensive and time consuming for us to develop a global marketing and sales force 
moreover  we may choose  or find it necessary  to enter into strategic collaborations to sell  market and distribute our products 
we may not be able to provide adequate incentive to our sales force or to establish and maintain favorable distribution and marketing collaborations with other companies to promote our products 
in addition  any third party with whom we have established a marketing and distribution relationship may not devote sufficient time to the marketing and sales of our product  thereby exposing us to potential expenses in exiting such distribution agreements 
any third party collaborators and we must also market our products in compliance with federal  state and local laws relating to the providing of incentives and inducements 
violation of these laws can result in substantial penalties 
if we are unable to successfully motivate and expand our marketing and sales force and further develop our sales and marketing capabilities  or if our distributors fail to promote our products  we will have difficulty maintaining and increasing our sales 
if we are unable to obtain adequate product liability insurance  then we may have to pay significant monetary damages in a successful product liability claim against us the development and sale of medical devices entails an inherent risk of product liability 
product liability insurance is generally expensive for medical device companies such as ours 
although we maintain limited product liability insurance coverage for our products  it is possible that we will not be able to obtain further product liability insurance on acceptable terms  if at all 
insurance we subsequently obtain may not provide us with adequate coverage against all potential claims 
if we are exposed to product liability claims for which we have insufficient insurance  we may be required to pay significant damages  which would prevent or delay our ability to commercialize our products 
if we are not able to compete effectively  we may experience decreased demand for our products  which may result in price reductions we have many competitors in the united states and abroad  including medical device  biotechnology and other alternative therapeutic companies  universities and other private and public research institutions 
our success depends upon our ability to develop and maintain a competitive position in the embolotherapy market 
our key medical device competitors are cordis corporation a johnson johnson company  boston scientific corporation and cook incorporated 
these and many of our other competitors have greater capabilities  experience and financial resources than we do 
as a result  they may develop products that compete with our microspheres product more rapidly or at less cost than we can 
currently  the primary products with which our microspheres compete for some of our applications are polyvinyl alcohol  polymerizing gels and coils 
in addition  our competitors may develop technologies that render our products obsolete or otherwise noncompetitive 
we may not be able to improve our products or develop new products or technologies quickly enough to maintain a competitive position in our market and continue to commercially develop our business 
moreover  we may not be able to compete effectively  and competitive pressures may result in less demand for our products and impair our ability to become profitable 
if we fail to maintain  or in some instances obtain  an adequate level of reimbursement for our products by third party payors  there may be no commercially viable markets for our products the availability and levels of reimbursement by governmental and other third party payors affects the market for any medical device 
we may not be able to sell our products profitably if reimbursement is unavailable or limited in scope or amount 
some insurance companies do not fully reimburse for embolization procedures 
these third party payors continually attempt to contain or reduce the costs of healthcare by challenging the prices that companies such as ours charge for medical products 
in some foreign countries  particularly the countries of the european union where our microspheres product is currently marketed and sold  the pricing of medical devices is subject to governmental control  and the prices charged for our products have in some instances been reduced as a result of these controls 
additionally  in both the united states and some foreign jurisdictions  there have been a number of legislative and regulatory proposals to change the healthcare system 
further proposals are likely 
these proposals  if adopted  could result in less revenue per procedure for us  and could affect our ability to market our products profitably 
if we do not retain our senior management  other key employees  scientific collaborators and advisors  we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy the loss of key members of our management team could harm us 
we also depend on our scientific collaborators and advisors  all of whom have other commitments that may limit their availability to us 
our success is substantially dependent on the ability  experience and performance of these members of our senior management and other key employees  scientific collaborators and advisors 
because of their ability and experience  if we lose one or more of these individuals  we may not be able to successfully implement our business strategy 
if we do not attract and retain skilled personnel  we will not be able to expand our business our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to attract and retain highly skilled scientific  operational  managerial and marketing personnel  particularly as we expand our activities in product development  the regulatory approval process and sales and manufacturing 
we face significant competition for these types of persons from other companies  research and academic institutions  government entities and other organizations 
consequently  if we are unable to attract and retain skilled personnel  we will not be able to expand our business 
if we make any acquisitions  we will incur a variety of costs and may never successfully integrate the acquired business into ours we may attempt to acquire businesses  technologies  services or products that we believe are a strategic complement to our business model 
we may encounter operating difficulties and expenditures relating to integrating an acquired business  technology  service or product 
these acquisitions may also absorb significant management attention that would otherwise be available for ongoing development of our business 
moreover  we may never realize the anticipated benefits of any acquisition 
we may also make dilutive issuances of equity securities  incur debt or experience a decrease in the cash available for our operations  or incur contingent liabilities in connection with any future acquisitions 
because sepracor inc and our executive officers and directors own a significant amount of our common stock  they may be able to exert control over us as of december   sepracor inc owned approximately of our outstanding common stock 
moreover  two of our directors are executive officers of sepracor 
sepracor and our executive officers and directors will have significant control over all corporate actions requiring stockholder approval  irrespective of how our other stockholders may vote  including the election of directors  the amendment of charter documents  the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions  including a sale of substantially all of our assets  and the defeat of any non negotiated takeover attempt that might otherwise benefit the public stockholders 
this ownership concentration could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
in addition  conflicts of interest between sepracor and us may arise  including with respect to competitive business activities and control of our management and our affairs 
if the estimates we make  and the assumptions on which we rely  in preparing our financial statements prove inaccurate  our actual results may vary from those reflected in our projections and accruals 
our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  the amounts of charges accrued by us and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
there can be no assurance  however  that our estimates  or the assumptions underlying them  will be correct 
this  in turn  could adversely affect our stock price 
risks relating to regulatory matters if we do not obtain the regulatory approvals required to market and sell our products  then our business may be unsuccessful and the market price of our stock may decline we are subject to regulation by government agencies in the united states and abroad with respect to the manufacture  packaging  labeling  advertising  promotion  distribution and sale of our products 
for example  our products are subject to approval or clearance by the fda prior to marketing in the united states for commercial use 
similar regulations exist in most major foreign markets  including the european union and asia 
the process of obtaining necessary regulatory approvals and clearances will be time consuming and expensive for us 
if we do not receive required regulatory approval or clearance to market our products  we may not be able to develop and commercialize our products and become profitable  and the value of our common stock may decline 
we plan to seek k clearance for our embogold microspheres for ufe 
there is no assurance that we will be able to gain such clearance 
if the fda or other regulatory agencies place restrictions on  or impose additional approval requirements with respect to  products we are then marketing  we may incur substantial additional costs and experience delays or difficulties in continuing to market and sell these products even though the fda granted us clearance with respect to marketing our embosphere microspheres  in the treatment of uterine fibroids  hypervascularized tumors and arteriovascular malformation  it may have placed certain restrictions on the indications for which we may market the product  which could result in lower revenues 
the marketing claims we are permitted to make in labeling or advertising regarding our microspheres are limited to those specified in any fda clearance or approval 
we may in the future make modifications to our microspheres or their labeling which we determine do not necessitate the filing of a new k notification 
however  if the fda does not agree with our determination  it will require us to make additional k filings for the modification  and we may be prohibited from marketing the modified product until we obtain fda clearance 
similarly  if we obtain premarket approval  we may not be able to make product or labeling changes until we get fda clearance 
further  the fda has classified our embolotherapy device into class iii  which means that even though we have obtained clearance under section k to market the device for certain indications  the fda could in the future promulgate a regulation requiring premarket approval of the device under section of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act to allow it to remain on the market 
we may experience difficulty in providing the fda with sufficient data for premarket approval in a timely fashion  if at all 
in addition  the fda may require us to conduct a postmarket surveillance study that would require us to track specific elements of patient experience with our microspheres product after we have begun marketing it 
if such a study revealed previously unknown adverse events or an unexpectedly high rate of adverse events  the fda could place further restrictions on our marketing of the device  or rescind our clearance or approval 
our products will be subject to continuing fda requirements relating to quality control  quality assurance  and maintenance of records  documentation  manufacturing  labeling and promotion of medical devices 
we are also required to submit medical device reports to the fda to report device related deaths or serious injuries  as well as malfunctions  the recurrence of which would be likely to cause or contribute to a death or serious injury 
these reports are publicly available 
if we fail to comply with regulatory laws and regulations  we will be subject to enforcement actions  which will affect our ability to market and sell our products and may harm our reputation if we fail to comply with applicable federal  state or foreign laws or regulations  we could be subject to enforcement actions  which could affect our ability to develop  market and sell our products successfully and could harm our reputation and lead to less acceptance of our products by the market 
these enforcement actions include product seizures  voluntary or mandatory recalls  voluntary or mandatory patient or physician notification  withdrawal of product clearances or approvals  withdrawal of investigational device exemption approval  restrictions on  or prohibitions against  marketing our products  fines  restrictions on importation of our products  injunctions  civil and criminal penalties  and withdrawal of premarket approval or rescission of premarket notification clearance 
risks relating to intellectual property if we are unable to obtain patent protection for our products  their competitive value could decline we may not obtain meaningful protection for our technology and products with the patents and patent applications that we own or license relating to our microsphere technology or other ancillary products 
in particular  the patent rights we possess or are pursuing generally cover our technologies to varying degrees  and these rights may not prevent others from designing products similar to or otherwise competitive with our microspheres and other products commercialized by us 
for example  our us patent directed to copolymers used to make our present microspheres expired in june two other us patents and their foreign equivalents are also directed to materials and methods for performing embolization 
to the extent that our competitors are able to design products competitive with ours without infringing our intellectual property rights  we may experience less market penetration with our products and  consequently  we may have decreased revenues 
we do not know whether competitors have similar united states patent applications on file  since united states patent applications filed before november  or for which no foreign patents will be sought are secret until issued  and applications filed after november  are published approximately months after their earliest priority date 
consequently  the united states patent and trademark office could initiate interference proceedings involving our owned or licensed united states patent applications or issued patents 
further  there is a substantial backlog of patent applications at the united states patent and trademark office  and the approval or rejection of patent applications may take several years 
we require our employees  consultants and advisors to execute confidentiality agreements 
however  we cannot guarantee that these agreements will provide us with adequate protection against improper use or disclosure of confidential information 
in addition  in some situations  these agreements may conflict with  or be subject to  the rights of third parties with whom our employees  consultants or advisors have prior employment or consulting relationships 
further  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information and techniques  or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
our failure to protect our proprietary information and techniques may inhibit or limit our ability to exclude certain competitors from the market 
if we become involved in expensive patent litigation or other proceedings to enforce our patent rights  we could incur substantial costs and expenses or substantial liability for damages or be required to stop our product development and commercialization efforts in order to protect or enforce our patent rights  we may have to initiate legal proceedings against third parties  such as infringement suits or interference proceedings 
by initiating legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  we may also provoke these third parties to assert claims against us and  as a result  our patents could be narrowed  invalidated or rendered unenforceable by a court 
furthermore  we may be sued for infringing on the intellectual property rights of others 
we may find it necessary  if threatened  to initiate a lawsuit seeking a declaration from a court regarding the proprietary rights of others 
intellectual property litigation is costly  and  even if we prevail  could divert management attention and resources away from our business 
the patent position of companies like ours generally is highly uncertain  involves complex legal and factual questions  and has recently been the subject of much litigation 
we may not prevail in any patent related proceeding 
if we do not prevail in any litigation  we could be required to pay damages  stop the infringing activity  or obtain a license 
any required license might not be available to us on acceptable terms  or at all 
in addition  some licenses may be nonexclusive  and therefore  our competitors may have access to the same technology licensed to us 
if we fail to obtain a required license or are unable to design around a patent  we may be prevented from selling some of our products  which could decrease our revenues 
if any of our licenses to use third party technologies in our products are terminated  we may be unable to develop  market or sell our products we are dependent on various license agreements relating to each of our current and proposed products that give us rights under intellectual property rights of third parties 
these licenses impose commercialization  sublicensing  royalty  insurance and other obligations on us 
our failure  or any third party s failure  to comply with the terms of any of these licenses could result in our losing our rights to the license  which could result in our being unable to develop  manufacture or sell products which contain the licensed technology 
risks relating to our financial results and need for financing we will continue to need additional funds  and if additional capital is not available  we may have to limit  scale back or cease our operations we may need to raise additional funds to develop and commercialize our products successfully 
if we cannot raise more funds  we could be required to reduce our capital expenditures  scale back our product development  reduce our workforce and license to others products or technologies that we otherwise would seek to commercialize ourselves 
although we may seek additional funding through collaborative arrangements  borrowing money or the sale of additional equity securities  we may not receive additional funding on reasonable terms or at all 
any sales of additional shares of our capital stock are likely to dilute our existing stockholders 
further  if we issue additional equity securities  the new equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of existing holders of our common stock 
alternatively  we may borrow money from commercial lenders  possibly at high interest rates  which will increase the risk of your investment in us 
if operating results fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter  then our stock price may decline our operating results could fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations may be due to several factors  including the timing and volume of customer orders for our commercial products  procedure cancellations and general economic conditions 
we also expect that our operating results will be affected by seasonality  since we expect our revenue growth to subside in the third quarter of each year from the first two quarters of each year because we typically experience a slowdown of business during the summer months 
due to these fluctuations  our operating results in some quarters may not meet the expectations of our investors 
in that case  our stock price may decline 
in addition  a large portion of our expenses  including expenses for facilities  equipment and personnel  are relatively fixed 
accordingly  if our revenue declines or does not grow as much as we anticipate  we might not be able to improve our operating margins 
failure to achieve anticipated levels of revenues could therefore significantly harm our operating results for a particular fiscal period 
risks relating to the production and supply of our products if we experience manufacturing delays or interruptions in production  then we may experience customer dissatisfaction and our reputation could suffer if we fail to produce enough products at our own manufacturing facility or at a third party manufacturing facility  we may be unable to deliver products to our customers on a timely basis  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction and could harm our reputation and ability to compete 
we currently produce all of our microsphere products in one manufacturing facility in france 
in addition  the final product packaging of our microspheres  segway guidewires  embocath catheters and certain other ancillary products sold in europe is performed by independent contract manufacturers under fda good manufacturing practices 
we would likely experience significant delays or cessation in producing our products at any of these facilities if a labor strike  natural disaster  local or regional conflict or other supply disruption were to occur 
if we are unable to manufacture our products at our facility in france  or package certain of our products with our contract manufacturer  we may be required to enter into arrangements with one or more alternative contract manufacturing companies 
in addition  if we are required to depend on third party manufacturers  our profit margins may be lower  which will make it more difficult for us to achieve profitability 
medical device manufacturers must adhere to the fda s current good manufacturing practices regulations  which are enforced by the fda through its facilities inspection program 
the manufacturers may not be able to comply or maintain compliance with good manufacturing practices regulations 
if our manufacturers fail to comply  their noncompliance could significantly delay our receipt of new product premarket approvals or result in fda enforcement action  including an embargo on imported devices 
for a premarket approval device  if we change our manufacturing facility or switch to a third party manufacturer  we will be required to submit a premarket approval application supplement before the change is implemented 
because we rely on a limited number of suppliers  we may experience difficulty in meeting our customers demands for our products in a timely manner or within budget we currently purchase key components of our microspheres from a variety of outside sources 
some of these components may only be available to us through a few sources 
our reliance on our suppliers exposes us to risks  including the possibility that one or more of our suppliers could terminate their services at any time without penalty  the potential inability of our suppliers to obtain required components  the potential delays and expenses of seeking alternative sources of supply  reduced control over pricing  quality and timely delivery due to the difficulties in switching to alternative suppliers  and the possibility that one or more of our suppliers could fail to satisfy any of the fda s required current good manufacturing practices regulations 
consequently  in the event that our suppliers delay or interrupt the supply of components for any reason  our ability to produce and supply our products could be impaired  which could lead to customer dissatisfaction 
risks relating to our foreign operations if we are unable to meet the operational  legal and financial challenges that we will encounter in our international operations  we may not be able to grow our business our worldwide manufacturing and european sales operations are currently conducted primarily through our french subsidiary 
furthermore  we currently derive a portion of our revenues from the sale of our microspheres and other products in the european union 
we are increasingly subject to a number of challenges which specifically relate to our international business activities 
our international operations may not be successful if we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges  which would limit the growth of our business 
these challenges include failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  which could slow our growth in international markets  potentially longer sales cycles to sell products  which could slow our revenue growth from international sales  and potentially longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable 
because we exchange foreign currency received from international sales into us dollars and are required to make foreign currency payments  we may incur losses due to fluctuations in foreign currency translations a significant portion of our business is conducted in the european union euro 
we recognize foreign currency gains or losses arising from our operations in the period incurred 
as a result  currency fluctuations between the us dollar and the currencies in which we do business will cause foreign currency translation gains and losses  which may cause fluctuations in our future operating results 
we do not currently engage in foreign exchange hedging transactions to manage our foreign currency exposure 
risk relating to our stock price because the market price of our stock is highly volatile  investments in our stock could rapidly lose their value and we may incur significant costs from class action litigation the market price of our stock is highly volatile 
as a result  investments in our stock could rapidly lose their value 
in addition  the stock market often experiences extreme price and volume fluctuations  which affect the market price of many medical device companies and which are often unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
recently  when the market price of a stock has been as volatile as our stock price has been  holders of that stock have occasionally instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders were to bring a lawsuit of this type against us  even if the lawsuit is without merit  we could incur substantial costs in defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
item properties we currently lease office and manufacturing facilities in rockland  massachusetts  and roissy  france 
our rockland  massachusetts  office includes approximately  square feet of corporate offices and laboratory space pursuant to a five year lease expiring in march of our roissy  france facility includes approximately  square feet of office  laboratory and manufacturing space and is leased through may at our facility in france  we produce our embosphere microspheres and some ancillary disposable devices 
embosphere microsphere production includes the synthesis of raw materials and third party manufactured intermediary compounds 
currently  the final product packaging of our microspheres  segway guidewires  embocath catheters and certain other ancillary products sold in europe is performed by independent contract manufacturers under fda good manufacturing practices 
we believe that our currently leased facilities in rockland  massachusetts  and roissy  france are suitable to meet our current requirements and that suitable additional or substitute space will be available to us on commercially reasonable terms  if needed in the future 
item legal proceedings on january   our french subsidiary  biosphere medical  sa  received notice from terumo europe  nv that terumo had initiated legal proceedings in the commercial court of pontoise  france alleging that it suffered damages from a purported termination of the distribution contract by biosphere medical  sa biosphere medical  sa and terumo europe entered into a distribution agreement in january pursuant to which terumo europe became the exclusive distributor of biosphere medical  sa embosphere microsphere and embogold microsphere products in certain countries of europe 
it is not possible at this time to make a reasonable assessment as to the final outcome of this proceeding

overview biosphere develops  manufactures and markets agents for medical applications using embolotherapy techniques 
our core technologies  consisting of patented bio engineered polymers and manufacturing methods  are used to produce miniature spherical beads with unique properties for a variety of applications 
embolotherapy works by reducing blood flow to target areas of the body 
the procedure is performed by injecting agents  usually particles  through a catheter and into the blood vessels that feed these target areas 
by selectively blocking the target tissue s blood supply  the deprived tissue will either become destroyed or devitalized  resulting in therapeutic benefit 
our principal focus is on growing our embosphere microsphere business worldwide  which we believe will be a key driver to our success 
we are also focused on maintaining our leadership position through the introduction of new embolic products  new accessory embolic products  and product improvements 
our revenue is primarily generated from product sales of our embosphere microspheres and embogold microspheres in the united states  european union  australia and canada 
product revenues also include the sale of barium and other ancillary medical device products manufactured by us or by third parties 
we believe that a majority of our revenue in the united states for the years ended december  and was derived from the sale of embosphere microspheres and embogold microspheres for use in uterine fibroid embolization 
in april  we received clearance from the fda for embolization of hypervascularized tumors and arteriovenous malformations 
in november  we received additional clearance from the fda to market our embosphere microspheres for use in treating symptomatic uterine fibroids in a procedure referred to as uterine fibroid embolization  or ufe 
currently  our embosphere microspheres are the only embolic product specifically approved for use in ufe 
after receiving ufe marketing clearance  we began an aggressive marketing campaign to promote our embosphere microspheres in the treatment of uterine fibroids 
we received ce mark approval of our embosphere microspheres product in the european union in ce mark approval is a certification granted by european regulatory bodies  or by some manufacturers with satisfactory quality systems  that substantiates the compliance of products with specific standards of quality and or safety 
this approval is generally required prior to the commercialization of a medical device in the european union 
in january  we received marketing approval of our embosphere microspheres product in australia and canada 
during  we established two wholly owned subsidiaries to pursue the development of other microsphere technologies 
in april  we established biosphere medical japan  inc  a delaware corporation  to develop and commercialize embosphere microspheres  as well as hepasphere sap microspheres  in asia 
in december  we established bsmd ventures  inc  also a delaware corporation  to explore and develop non embolotherapy applications 
we have experienced operating losses in each fiscal period since our inception 
as of december   we had approximately million in cash and short term marketable securities and an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
in connection with the execution of our business plan  we expect to experience continued operating losses for the next fiscal year 
critical accounting policies the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure at the date of our financial statements 
our significant accounting policies are summarized in note b to our consolidated financial statements 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical in gaining full understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition revenues from product sales are recognized when requested goods are shipped to customers and collection is considered probable 
management establishes reserves for potential sales returns and evaluates  on a monthly basis  the adequacy of those reserves based upon realized experience 
under our current policy  only those products on a customer s initial order qualify for product satisfaction related credit returns 
to date  returns related to product satisfaction have been minimal and immaterial 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any significant change in product satisfaction and any resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
accounts receivable we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon our historical payment experience and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
substantially all of our receivables are due from hospitals  distributors  health care clinics  and managed care systems located throughout the united states  australia  canada  and europe 
a significant portion of products sold  both foreign and domestic  are ultimately funded through government reimbursement programs 
as a consequence  changes in these programs can have an adverse impact on liquidity and profitability of our customer base 
inventories we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase or manufacture the inventory or the market value for such inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities in process and on hand and record a provision for production loss and obsolete inventory based primarily on actual loss experience and on our estimated forecast of product demand 
a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess inventory quantities on hand 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize such costs in our costs of goods sold at the time of such determination 
although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our production process and forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in production yield or product demand could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
deferred taxes we use the asset and liability accounting method whereby deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized based on temporary differences between the financial statements and tax bases of assets and liabilities using current statutory tax rates 
a valuation allowance against net deferred tax assets is recorded if  based on the available evidence  it is more likely than not that some or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
management evaluates  on a quarterly basis  the ability to recover the deferred tax assets and the level of the valuation allowance 
due to the size of our net operating loss carryforward in relation to our history of unprofitable operations  we have not recognized any of our net deferred tax assets 
during  we recorded income tax benefits equal to the cumulative amount of recoverable prior years tax payments and expense primarily foreign subsidiary and certain state minimum net worth tax for current income 
however  future improvements in operational performance could result in the increased certainty of our ability to apply our deferred tax assets against taxable income which could  in turn  result in a significant impact on the value of our deferred tax assets and our reported operating results 
results of operations years ended december  and total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in included in total revenue was  of collaboration revenue earned in relation to a supply agreement dissolved in the or million increase in product sales from to is primarily due to an increase in volume sales of embogold microspheres and embosphere microspheres in north america 
also significantly contributing to the sales growth was an increase in the average per unit selling price of our microspheres  driven mostly by the september introduction of a premium priced embogold microspheres in a pre filled syringe package  and the may introduction of our new embosphere microspheres pre filled syringe package 
north american product sales increased from million in to million in as a result of our strategic focus on ufe and other embolotherapy applications using our microsphere products  we expect that sales of embosphere microspheres and our ancillary embolotherapy delivery systems will continue to increase and account for the majority of our revenue in costs of products sold for year ended december  was million  compared with million for the same period in the or  increase was primarily due to a increase in product sales  partially offset by a shift in the aggregate product sales mix away from the lower margin european ancillary device products to the higher margin embosphere microspheres and embogold microspheres products 
gross margin from all our device product sales for the year ended december  was million  or approximately of product sales  compared with million  or of product sales  for the same period in research and development expenses incurred in and relate to i research to identify and evaluate new and innovative embolotherapy products based on our platform microsphere technology  ii pre clinical testing and clinical trials of product candidates  iii development related to improving manufacturing processes  and iv product and production facilities validation processes under fda good manufacturing practices 
our research efforts are primarily focused in the following areas continuing to advance our microsphere technology for use in embolotherapy applications  developing next generation embolotherapy technologies  including active microsphere platforms that advance the scope of embolotherapy into new therapeutic applications  and building a broad  ancillary product portfolio to complement our microsphere platforms in embolotherapy applications 
our research and development functions typically work on a number of projects concurrently 
in addition  except for clinical expenses  a substantial amount of fixed research and development costs such as salary and salary related benefits  rent  equipment depreciation  utilities  insurance and maintenance are shared among various programs 
accordingly  we have not and do not plan to separately track all specific costs for each of our research and development projects 
we estimate that during the year ended december  and  the majority of our research and development expenses were related to clinical trial costs  development and validation of our new embotherapy products and packaging formats  development and validation of our embocath catheter and segway guidewire  as well as salary and related benefit expenses and laboratory supplies related to our radiosphere  temprx and hepasphere sap programs 
in the year ended december   total research and development expenses decreased  from million in to million in the same period in the decrease was primarily due to the completion of our pivotal phase ii clinical trials to support fda specific labeling clearance to use our microsphere products in the treatment of uterine fibroids 
total clinical costs were  and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
also contributing to the decrease was a decline in new syringe and new vial packaging validation costs as these products were transitioned out of development and into production in late offsetting the decrease  to a limited extent  was an increase in salary and related benefit expenses associated with increased research and development functions in the united states 
we anticipate that our research and development expenses through the next several quarters will remain consistent with current expense levels as other pipeline products and technologies progress through their respective development and approval processes 
selling and marketing expenses for the year ended december  decreased to million from million in the reduction in expenses was primarily due to territory realignment to focus our efforts on geographic areas with higher anticipated procedural volume 
as a result of our receipt in november of fda clearance to market our embosphere microspheres in ufe  we anticipate selling and marketing expenses to increase significantly over the next year as we begin aggressively promoting i ufe awareness as an alternative to hysterectomy  and ii embosphere microspheres as a uniquely beneficial product in ufe procedures 
selling and marketing expenses are also expected to grow consistent with realized growth in worldwide product sales 
general and administrative expenses increased from million for the year ended december  to million in the increase was primarily due to executive transition and severance expenses incurred in connection with the departures of the former ceo and european president 
offsetting the total general and administrative expense increase was the absence of litigation defense expenses during and the elimination of goodwill amortization expenses as required under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
interest income was  for the year ended december  compared with  in the decrease in interest income from to was due primarily to decreases in the average daily invested cash balances and interest rates on available investment grade assets 
interest expense is generally incurred in relation to capital leases and short term working capital bank obligations 
interest expense was relatively consistent from to other income loss increased to  in from  in the increase in was due primarily to realized euro to us dollar foreign currency exchange gains associated with our intercompany trade accounts 
loss of  was primarily comprised of realized foreign currency exchange losses 
also contributing to the increase in other income from to was a  reversal during of a french statutory reserve established in connection with a business acquisition 
income tax benefit recorded during represents recoverable prior year tax expense 
all other tax benefit resulting from our operating losses has been reserved for in its entirety as management believes the ability to realize any benefit against future taxable income is uncertain 
years ended december  and total revenue increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the same period in included in the total revenue was  in collaboration revenue recognized in relation to a supply agreement dissolved in the or million increase in product sales from million in to million in was primarily due to an increase in sales of our embosphere microspheres in north america following receipt of fda k clearance for use of our embosphere microspheres for embolization of hypervascularized tumors and arteriovenous malformations and the resultant commercial introduction in april north american product sales increased from million in to million in costs of products sold for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in the or  increase was due to increased sales volume offset by the effects of a shift in product sales to the embosphere microsphere products  which produced higher gross profit margins than our other products 
also contributing to the gross margin improvement during and was the effect of improved manufacturing efficiencies associated with higher manufacturing volume at our french production facility 
gross margin from product sales for the year ended december  was million or of product sales  compared with million or of product sales for the same period in research and development expenses increased to million in from million in the million increase from to was due primarily to clinical trial and regulatory submission costs incurred relative to seeking regulatory clearance for embosphere microspheres and embogold microspheres in the united states 
the increase from to was also due to the final process development and product validation costs incurred with respect to the release of our embogold microspheres product line  combined with additional salary and staffing expense in the united states 
selling  general and administrative expenses  net of non cash  non employee stock option acceleration charges  increased to million for the year ended december  from million in the million increase in selling  general and administrative expenses from to were primarily due to the implementation of our product commercialization plan  including salary and other related costs associated with increased personnel  as well as other expenses associated with developing and introducing a new product platform in both the north american and european territories 
in connection with stock options previously issued to non employee advisors  we recognized  in accordance with emerging issues task force abstract accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services eitf  million in non employee compensation expense during the year ended december  the non cash stock based compensation charge has been presented as a separate line item within the statement of operations for the year ended december  the million aggregate fair value of the non employee stock options was derived from the black scholes option pricing model 
interest income was  in the year ended december  compared to  in the growth in interest income was due to the continued increase in average daily invested cash balances offset  to a limited extent  by reduced rates of return 
increased invested cash primarily resulted from the net proceeds of million  million and million from our february  july and july equity placements  respectively 
interest expense decreased from  in to  in interest expense during primarily resulted from the cost of financing working capital as well as certain capital leases  particularly in our french subsidiary 
interest expense in resulted primarily from non cash interest charges generated from the potential obligation to purchase the remaining outstanding minority interest in bmsa 
see note c to the consolidated financial statements 
other income and expense decreased from  in  to  in other income and expense is primarily comprised of the foreign currency exchange gains and losses and  to a limited extent  gains on the sale of idle assets 
income tax expense recorded during represents statutory income tax associated with the operations of our french subsidiary 
liquidity and capital resources we have historically funded our operations from product sales  net proceeds provided by public and private equity offerings  funds provided by the sale of our former chromatography business  funds provided by sepracor  bank financing  equipment financing leases and  to a lesser extent  the exercise of stock options 
as of december   we had million of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities  a decrease of million from million as of december  this decrease resulted from million used to fund operations and  used in property and plant purchases offset  to a limited extent  by  in net investment proceeds   provided by financing activities and  in foreign exchange euro rate changes 
as of december   we had million in working capital 
we expect to finance our operations through product sales and existing cash balances 
for the year ended december   we used million in operating cash primarily to fund our sales  marketing  research and product development activities and to finance working capital requirements 
cash used in operations is expected to decrease over the next twelve month period as anticipated increases in product sales are expected to partially offset the company s operational and product development expenditures 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december   and primarily represents transfers of investments to cash to fund current operational needs 
offsetting the total increase was  in property and equipment purchases 
property and equipment purchases during the year ended december  included the acquisition and completed implementation of a new management information system  as well as additional scientific  manufacturing and computer equipment needed for our expansion in both the united states and french facilities 
we anticipate that the level of capital expenditures over the next twelve to eighteen months will be comparable with levels of spending over the prior twelve to eighteen month period  consistent with our plan to expand our infrastructure capabilities 
if available on favorable terms  we expect to finance certain future fixed asset acquisitions through leasing arrangements 
net cash provided by financing activities was  for the nine months ended december   of which  resulted from the exercise of common stock options and warrants and  was used in principle payments on outstanding debt and lease obligations 
we believe that our existing cash and other working capital  including the approximate million in cash and cash equivalents that we have as of december   will be sufficient to fund our operating and capital requirements  as currently planned  at least through the next twelve month period 
however  our cash requirements may vary materially from those now planned due to a number of factors  including  without limitation  changes in post ufe clearance marketing programs  anticipated research and development efforts  the scope and results of pre clinical and clinical testing  changes in the focus and direction of our research and development programs  competitive and technological advances  the timing and results of fda regulatory review and the market s acceptance of any approved products 
we expect to incur additional costs  including costs related to ongoing research and development activities  pre clinical studies  clinical trials  the expansion of our manufacturing  laboratory and administrative functions  as well as costs relating to further market development and commercialization efforts 
we may also need additional funds for possible strategic acquisitions of synergistic businesses  products and or technologies 
these additional funds may be substantial and raised from time to time through additional public or private sales of equity  through borrowings  or through other financings 
there are no assurances that we will be able to obtain any additional funding that may be required on acceptable terms 
borrowing arrangement in march  bmsa entered into a   equivalent as of december  term loan with a french national bank that is payable in euros over five years and accrues interest at per annum 
the total loan balance outstanding as of december  was approximately  or in may  we entered into a two year credit facility with a bank under which we may borrow  subject to limitations defined in the agreement  up to million for general working capital and corporate purposes 
there were no borrowings outstanding under this agreement as of december  each available   or day advance shall bear interest at a per annum rate that we may select equal to either i a variable rate as determined by the bank or ii a rate equal to the corresponding   or day libor rate to of december  plus a libor advance rate spread as determined by certain current working capital balances at the time of the advance 
our ability to borrow under this credit line is dependent upon maintenance of certain financial ratios and levels of cash and cash equivalents and tangible capital bases 
in connection with the credit facility  the company has entered into a security agreement pursuant to which we have pledged to the bank all of our us assets  excluding the equity ownership of bmsa  as collateral 
as of december   we were in compliance with all credit facility covenants 
commitments as of december   we have entered into two operating leases pursuant to the lease of our facilities in rockland  massachusetts and roissy  france 
the rockland  massachusetts  lease expires in march of and the roissy  france operating lease expires in may during  we entered into several non cancelable capital lease agreements with various equipment financing companies  in connection with the acquisition of certain manufacturing and computer equipment 
the leases have initial terms of to months with interest rates of to 
all corresponding leased equipment serves as pledged capital with respect to each respective capital lease agreement 
future cash payments  including interest  under contractual obligations in effect as of december   are as follows period term loans operating leases capital leases total in thousands thereafter total contractual cash commitments related party transactions currently  the final product packaging of our microspheres  segway guidewires  embocath catheters and certain other ancillary products sold in europe is performed by independent contract manufacturers under fda good manufacturing practices 
if such services were not available at a reasonable cost from our existing contract manufacturers  we would need to obtain new contracts with new providers or incur the expense of internalizing the packaging process 
such a conversion could cause us to incur additional expense in validating the process under fda good manufacturing practices  delay the availability of finished product and limit commercial sales of our products 
as of december   the receivable from related party included offering expenses in the amount  that sepracor  inc agreed to pay as a result of sepracor s participation in the july secondary offering of million shares of our common stock 
partially offsetting the offering expenses owed to us were amounts due to sepracor for certain health benefits paid by sepracor on our behalf  along with related health benefit administrative services provided on an arm s length basis through october as of december   all service agreements with sepracor had been either terminated or discontinued  and as of december   all related party commitments have been settled in full 
as of december   sepracor owns approximately of our outstanding shares of common stock 
pursuant to this ownership interest  sepracor is also entitled to certain rights with respect to the registration under the securities act of a total of  shares of our common stock 
these rights provide that sepracor may require us to register shares  subject to certain conditions and limitations 
as of december   sepracor has not exercised such rights 
for the year ended december   we were not a party to any unconsolidated special purpose entities or financial instruments with off balance sheet risk 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities fas 
fas reconsiders all of the guidance contained in eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
fas applies to costs associated with a certain termination benefits commonly identified as one time termination benefits  b costs to terminate a contract that is not a capital lease  and c other associated costs  including costs to consolidate facilities or relocate employees 
fas  which may be adopted early  is effective for exit and disposal activities initiated after december  we are currently evaluating fas and are unable  at this time  to determine the impact  if any  that might result from adopting this standard 
fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor accounting  will significantly change current practice in the accounting for  and disclosure of  guarantees 
most guarantees are to be recognized and initially measured at fair value  which is a change from current practice 
in addition  guarantors will be required to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of the guarantor making payments under the guarantee is remote 
in general  the interpretation applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that contingently require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party based on changes in an underlying that is related to an asset  liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party 
the interpretation s disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december   while the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
at the november  meeting  the emerging issues task force reached a consensus on issue  accounting for revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables  which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  and or rights to use assets 
the final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  with early adoption permitted 
additionally  companies will be permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
we do not believe the adoption of eitf will have a material impact on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  and derivative commodity instruments as of december   we did not participate in any derivative financial instruments or other financial and commodity instruments for which fair value disclosure would be required under financial accounting standards board statement of financial accounting standard no 
disclosures about fair value of financial instruments 
however  in the future  the company may consider certain financing instruments  including foreign currency forward contracts  or alternative instruments  which may be considered derivative in nature 
primary market risk exposures our primary market risk exposure is in the area of foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we are exposed to currency exchange rate fluctuations related to our operations in france 
operations in france are denominated in the euro  and as of december   approximately  or  remained outstanding within the inter company trade accounts 
accordingly  a hypothetical percent increase in euro to us dollar conversion rates would result in an approximate  foreign currency market to market change in the fair value of our inter company trade account balance as of december  we have not engaged in formal currency hedging activities to date  but do have a limited natural hedge in that our revenues and expenses in france are primarily denominated in the euro 
we also attempt to minimize exchange rate risk by converting non us currency to non us dollars as often as practicable 
we generally view our investment in foreign subsidiaries operating under a functional currency the euro other than our reporting currency the us dollar as long term 
our investment in foreign subsidiaries is sensitive to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates 
the effect of a change in foreign exchange rates on our net investment in foreign subsidiaries is reflected in the other accumulated comprehensive loss component of stockholders equity 
because our foreign currency exchange rate risk is not material  no quantitative tabular disclosure has been provided 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that an increase in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to decrease 
to minimize this risk in the future  we maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities  including commercial paper  investment grade asset backed corporate securities  money market funds and government and non government debt securities 
a hypothetical basis point increase in interest rates would result in an approximate  decrease in the fair value of our investments as of december  however  due to the conservative nature of our investments  the relatively short duration of their maturities  our ability to convert some or all of our long term investments to less interest rate sensitive holdings and our general intent to hold most securities until maturity  we believe interest rate risk is mitigated 
as of december   approximately of the million classified as available for sale marketable securities will mature within one year
