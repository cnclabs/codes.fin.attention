item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates our financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
the policies discussed below are considered by management to be critical because they are not only important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations but also because application and interpretation of these policies requires both judgment and estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain and unknown 
as a result  actual results may differ materially from our estimates 
sales allowances and bad debt reserves we principally derive revenue from sales of packaged interactive software games designed for play on videogame consoles such as the playstation  xbox and nintendo gamecube  pcs and hand held game machines such as the nintendo game boy advance 
product revenue is recognized net of sales allowances 
we also have stock balancing programs for our personal computer products  which allow for the exchange of personal computer products by resellers under certain circumstances 
we may decide to provide price protection for both our personal computer and video game system products 
in making this determination we evaluate inventory remaining in the channel  the rate of inventory sell through in the channel  and our remaining inventory on hand 
it is our policy to exchange products or give credits  rather than give cash refunds 
we estimate potential future product returns  price protection and stock balancing programs related to current period product revenue 
we analyze historical returns  current sell through of distributor and retailer inventory of our products  current trends in the video game market and the overall economy  changes in customer demand and acceptance of our products and other related factors when evaluating the adequacy of the sales returns and price protection allowances 
in addition  management monitors and manages the volume of our sales to retailers and distributors and their inventories  as substantial overstocking in the distribution channel can result in high returns or the requirement for substantial price protection in subsequent periods 
in the past  actual returns have not generally exceeded our reserves 
however  actual returns and price protections may materially exceed our estimates as unsold products in the distribution channels are exposed to rapid changes in consumer preferences  market conditions or technological obsolescence due to new platforms  product updates or competing products 
for example  the risk of product returns for our products may increase as the xbox  nintendo gamecube and playstation consoles pass the midpoint of their lifecycle and an increasing number and aggregate amount of competitive products heighten pricing and competitive pressures 
while management believes it can make reliable estimates for these matters  if we changed our assumptions and estimates  our returns reserves would change  which would impact the net revenue we report 
for example  if actual returns were significantly greater than the reserves we have established  the actual results would decrease our reported revenue 
conversely  if actual returns were significantly less than our reserves  this would increase our reported revenue 
similarly  significant judgment is required to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts in any accounting period 
we determine our allowance for doubtful accounts by evaluating customer creditworthiness in the context of current economic trends 
depending upon the overall economic climate and the financial condition of our customers  the amount and timing of our bad debt expense could change significantly 
we cannot predict customer bankruptcies or an inability of any of our customers to meet their financial obligations to us 
therefore  our estimates could differ materially from actual results 
our gross accounts receivable balance was million and our allowance for product returns  pricing allowances and doubtful accounts was million as of march  as of march   our gross accounts receivable balance was million and our allowance for product returns  pricing 
table of contents allowances and doubtful accounts was million 
reserves for bad debts and sales allowances increased percent from million at march  to million at march  the increase in the overall reserves as of march  is due to the increase in gross revenue in the six and months ended march  compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year 
net revenue increased percent during fiscal due to the higher installed base of playstation consoles and having a full year of sales of games for the xbox and nintendo gamecube 
the increase in price protection and sales returns is directly attributable to the increase in sales that occurred during fiscal sales return and price protection requirements as a percentage of gross revenue in the six and months ended march  have remained relatively constant compared to the same periods in the prior fiscal year 
we have recorded reserves for returns of product and price protection credits issued for products sold in prior periods 
we believe these reserves are adequate based on historical experience and our current estimate of potential returns and allowances 
prepaid royalties prepaid royalties consist primarily of prepayments we make for manufacturing royalties  advances paid to our co publishing and or distribution affiliates and license fees paid to celebrities  professional sports organizations and other organizations for our use of their trade name and content 
also included in prepaid royalties are prepayments made to independent software developers under development arrangements that have alternative future uses 
prepaid royalties are expensed at the contractual or effective royalty rate as cost of goods sold based on actual net product sales 
we evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties quarterly and charge to cost of goods sold any product post launch amounts we deem unlikely to be realized through product sales 
any impairments on pre launch advances are charged to research and development expense 
we rely on forecasted revenue to evaluate the future realization of prepaid royalties 
if actual revenue  or revised sales forecasts  fall below the initial forecasted sales  the charge may be larger than anticipated in any given quarter 
once the charge has been taken  that amount will not be expensed in future quarters when the product has shipped 
the current portion of prepaid royalties  included in other current assets  was million at march  and million at march  the long term portion of prepaid royalties  included in other assets  was million at march  and million at march  valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets we evaluate both purchased intangible assets and long lived assets in order to determine if events or changes in circumstances indicate an other than temporary impairment in value 
this evaluation requires us to estimate  among other things  the remaining useful lives along with future estimates of cash flows of the business 
all require the use of judgment and estimates 
our actual results could differ materially from our current estimates 
under current accounting standards  we make judgments about the remaining useful lives of purchased intangible assets and other long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate an other than temporary impairment in the remaining value of the assets recorded on our balance sheet 
in order to determine if an other than temporary impairment has occurred  management makes various assumptions about the future value of the asset  by evaluating future business prospects and estimated cash flows 
our future net cash flows are primarily dependent on the sale of products for play on proprietary video game platforms 
the success of our products is affected by our ability to accurately predict which platforms and which products we develop will be successful 
also  our revenue and earnings are dependent on our ability to meet our product release schedules 
due to product sales shortfalls  we may not realize the future net cash flows necessary to recover our long lived assets  which may result in an impairment charge recorded in the future 
we recorded asset impairment charges of million during fiscal and million during fiscal see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements  included in item hereof  for a discussion of the asset impairment charges recorded 
on april   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
as a result of adopting this standard  we will continue to amortize finite lived intangibles  but no longer amortize certain other intangible assets  most notably goodwill 
in 
table of contents lieu of amortization  sfas no 
requires a two step approach to testing goodwill for impairment for each reporting unit 
the first step  which was required to be completed by september   tests for impairment by applying fair value based tests at the company s reporting unit level 
the second step if necessary  required to be completed by march   measures the amount of impairment by applying fair value based tests to individual assets and liabilities within each reporting unit 
we completed the first step of transitional goodwill impairment testing during the first quarter of fiscal and found no indicators of impairment of our recorded goodwill 
as a result  we have recognized no transitional impairment loss in fiscal in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
we completed the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of fiscal with a measurement date of january  and found no indicators of impairment of our recorded goodwill 
future impairment tests may result in a charge to earnings and there is a potential for a write down of goodwill in connection with the annual impairment test 
following adoption of sfas no 
 we continue to evaluate whether any event has occurred which might indicate that the carrying value of an intangible asset is not recoverable 
income taxes in the ordinary course of the company s business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our current tax exposures in each jurisdiction including the impact  if any  of additional taxes resulting from tax examinations and making judgments regarding the recoverability of deferred tax assets 
a valuation allowance is established to the extent recovery of deferred tax assets is not likely based on our estimation of future taxable income in each jurisdiction 
tax exposures can involve complex issues and may require an extended period to resolve 
to determine the quarterly tax rate  we are required to estimate full year income and the related income tax expense in each jurisdiction 
the estimated effective tax rate is adjusted for the tax related to significant unusual items 
changes in the geographic mix or estimated level of annual pre tax income can affect the overall effective tax rate

we also derive additional revenue from selling subscriptions to some of our online games  selling advertisements on our online web pages  selling our packaged goods through our online store and by allowing other companies to manufacture and sell our products in conjunction with other products

com business segment to reduce its workforce and consolidate facilities 
these restructuring and resulting asset impairment charges were necessary in order to focus on key online priorities and reduce the ea

table of contents adjustments to the restructuring reserves in future periods  if necessary  based upon the then current events and circumstances 
the restructuring plan resulted in the termination of approximately employees  or one third of the ea 
com business segment workforce  which affected all departments across the organization 
the estimated costs for consolidation of facilities are comprised of contractual rental commitments under real estate leases for vacated office space offset by estimated future sub lease income 
included in these costs are estimated costs to close offices or consolidate facilities in various locations and costs to write off a portion of the assets from these facilities 
in addition  our restructuring efforts required an evaluation of asset impairment in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  to adjust these depreciable assets and certain intangibles to their estimated fair value 
we evaluated the impact of consolidating or abandoning certain online technologies and processes and reviewed the effect of changes to our subscription online product offerings in relation to the asset base of the ea

if any of the events or circumstances described below occurs  our business and financial performance could be harmed and the market value of our securities could decline 
if we do not develop products for widely accepted new video game platforms  our business will suffer 
we derive most of our revenue from the sale of products for play on proprietary video game platforms of third parties  such as sony s playstation therefore  the success of our products is driven in large part by the success of new video game hardware systems and our ability to accurately predict which platforms will be most successful in the marketplace 
we must make product development decisions and commit significant resources well in advance of the anticipated introduction of a new platform 
a new platform for which we are developing products may be delayed  may not succeed or may have a shorter life cycle than anticipated 
if the platforms for which we are developing products are not released when anticipated or do not attain wide market acceptance  our revenue growth will suffer 
if we do not accurately predict the importance to consumers of online game play for different console products  our sales may be limited in the future 
sony and microsoft have introduced online game play for their respective playstation and xbox consoles 
we anticipate that nintendo will do so for its gamecube console 
we have agreed to support online game features for our sony playstation products but do not currently offer similar capability for our xbox products 
we currently cannot predict the importance to consumers of these features 
if consumers consider online play capability to be a significant component of games for the xbox  our sales of products for the xbox would decline 
our business is both seasonal and cyclical 
if we fail to deliver our products at the right times  our sales will suffer 
our business is highly seasonal  with the highest levels of consumer demand  and a significant percentage of our revenue  occurring in the december quarter 
the timing of hardware platform introduction is often tied to the year end holiday season and is not within our control 
if we miss this key selling period  due to product delays or delayed introduction of a new platform for which we have developed products  our sales will suffer disproportionately 
our industry is also cyclical 
video game platforms have historically had a life cycle of four to six years 
as one group of platforms is reaching the end of its cycle and new platforms are emerging  consumers often defer game software purchases until the new platforms are available  causing sales to decline 
this decline may not be offset by increased sales of products for the new platform 
for example  the market for products for sony s older playstation game console has dropped faster than expected since the launch of the playstation platform 
our business is intensely competitive and increasingly hit driven 
if we do not continue to deliver hit products  our success will be limited 
competition in our industry is intense  and new products are regularly introduced 
during calendar year  approximately percent of the sales of videogames in north america consisted of only hit products out of thousands published 
these hit titles are increasingly expensive to produce 
if our competitors develop more successful products  or if we do not continue to develop consistently high quality products  our revenue will decline 

table of contents if we are unable to maintain or acquire licenses to intellectual property  we will publish fewer hit titles and our revenue will decline 
many of our products are based on or incorporate intellectual property owned by others 
for example  our ea sports products include intellectual property licenses from the major sports leagues and players associations 
similarly  many of our hit ea games titles such as james bond  harry potter and lord of the rings  are based on key film and literary licenses 
competition for these licenses is intense 
if we are unable to maintain these licenses and obtain additional licenses with significant commercial value  we will be unable to increase our revenue in the future 
if patent claims continue to be asserted against us  we may be unable to sustain our current business models or profits 
many patents have been issued that may apply to widely used game technologies 
additionally  infringement claims under many recently issued patents are now being asserted against internet implementations of existing games 
several such claims have been asserted against us 
such claims can harm our business 
we incur substantial expenses in evaluating and defending against such claims  regardless of the merits of the claims 
in the event that there is a determination that we have infringed a third party patent  we could incur significant monetary liability and be prevented from using the rights in the future 
other intellectual property claims may increase our product costs or require us to cease selling affected products 
many of our products include extremely realistic graphical images  and we expect that as technology continues to advance  images will become even more realistic 
some of the images and other content are based on real world examples that may inadvertently infringe upon the intellectual property rights of others 
although we believe that we make reasonable efforts to ensure that our products do not violate the intellectual property rights of others  it is possible that third parties still may claim infringement 
from time to time  we receive communications from third parties regarding such claims 
existing or future infringement claims against us  whether valid or not  may be time consuming and expensive to defend 
such claims or litigations could require us to stop selling the affected products  redesign those products to avoid infringement  or obtain a license  all of which would be costly and harm our business 
our business  our products and our distribution are subject to increasing regulation in key territories of content  consumer privacy and online delivery 
if we do not successfully respond to these regulations  our business may suffer 
legislation is continually being introduced that may affect both the content of our products and their distribution 
for example  privacy laws in the united states and europe impose various restrictions on our web sites 
those rules vary by territory although the internet recognizes no geographical boundaries 
other countries  such as germany  have adopted laws regulating content both in packaged goods and those transmitted over the internet that are stricter than current united states laws 
in the united states  the federal and several state governments are considering content restrictions on products such as ours  as well as restrictions on distribution of such products 
any one or more of these factors could harm our business by limiting the products we are able to offer to our customers and by requiring additional differentiation between products for different territories to address varying regulations 
this additional product differentiation would be costly 
if we do not consistently meet our product development schedules  we will experience fluctuations in our operating results 
product development schedules  particularly for new hardware platforms  high end multimedia pcs and the internet  are difficult to predict because they involve creative processes  use of new development tools for new platforms and the learning process  research and experimentation associated with 
table of contents development for new technologies 
we have in the past experienced development delays for several of our products 
failure to meet anticipated production or go live schedules may cause a shortfall in our revenue and profitability and cause our operating results to be materially different from expectations 
delays that prevent release of our products during peak selling seasons may reduce lifetime sales of those products 
technology changes rapidly in our business  and if we fail to anticipate new technologies  the quality  timeliness and competitiveness of our products will suffer 
rapid technology changes in our industry require us to anticipate  sometimes years in advance  which technologies our products must take advantage of in order to make them competitive in the market at the time they are released 
therefore  we usually start our product development with a range of technical development goals that we hope to be able to achieve 
we may not be able to achieve these goals  or our competition may be able to achieve them more quickly than we can 
in either case  our products may be technologically inferior to competitive products  or less appealing to consumers  or both 
if we cannot achieve our technology goals within the original development schedule of our products  then we may delay products until these technology goals can be achieved  which may delay or reduce revenue and increase our development expenses 
alternatively  we may increase the resources employed in research and development in an attempt to accelerate our development of new technologies  either to preserve our product launch schedule or to keep up with our competition  which would increase our development expenses 
if we do not continue to attract and retain key personnel  we will be unable to effectively conduct our business 
the market for technical  creative  marketing and other personnel essential to the development of our products and management of our businesses is extremely competitive 
in the last fiscal year  notwithstanding the downturn of the economy generally  competitive recruiting efforts aimed at our employees and executives continued 
for example  in fiscal  a team of employees that developed one of our hit medal of honor products left the company to develop products for a competitor 
our leading position within the interactive entertainment industry makes us a prime target for recruiting of executives and key creative talent 
in addition  the cost of real estate in the san francisco bay area the location of our headquarters and one of our largest studios remains high  and has made recruiting from other areas and relocating employees to our headquarters more difficult 
if we cannot successfully recruit and retain the employees we need  our ability to develop and manage our businesses will be impaired 
our platform licensors are our chief competitors and frequently control the manufacturing of and or access to our video game products 
if they do not approve our products  we will be unable to ship to our customers 
our agreements with hardware licensors such as sony for the playstation  microsoft for the xbox and nintendo for the gamecube  who are also our chief competitors  typically give significant control to the licensor over the approval and manufacturing of our products  which could  in certain circumstances  leave us unable to get our products approved  manufactured and shipped to customers 
in most events  control of the approval and manufacturing process by the platform licensors increases both our manufacturing lead times and costs as compared to those we can achieve independently 
while we believe that our relationships with our hardware licensors are currently good  the potential for delay or refusal to approve or manufacture our products exists 
such occurrences would harm our business and our financial performance 
in addition  as online capabilities for videogame platforms emerge  our platform licensors will control our ability to provide online game capabilities for our console platform products 
currently  both microsoft and sony provide online capabilities for xbox and playstation products  respectively 
in each case  compatibility code and the consent of the licensor are required for us to include online capabilities in our products 
in addition  the business model for microsoft s and sony s online businesses for their videogame 
table of contents products may compete with our online business 
as these capabilities become more significant  the failure or refusal of our licensors to approve our products  or the successful deployment by these licensors of services competitive to ours may harm our business 
our international revenues are subject to currency fluctuations 
for the year ended march  international net revenue comprised percent of total consolidated net revenue 
for the fiscal year ended march   international net revenue comprised percent of total consolidated net revenue 
we expect foreign sales to continue to account for a significant and growing portion of our revenue 
such sales are subject to unexpected regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers 
additionally  foreign sales are primarily made in local currencies  which may fluctuate against the dollar 
while we hedge against foreign currency fluctuations  we cannot control translation issues 
our reported financial results could be affected if significant changes in current accounting principles are adopted 
recent actions and public comments from the sec have focused on the integrity of financial reporting generally 
similarly  congress has considered a variety of bills that could affect certain accounting principles 
the fasb and other regulatory accounting agencies have recently introduced several new or proposed accounting standards  such as accounting for stock options  some of which represent a significant change from current practices 
changes in our accounting for stock options could materially increase our reported expenses 
our stock price has been volatile and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
as a result of the factors discussed in this report and other factors that may arise in the future  the market price of our common stock historically has been  and we expect will continue to be  subject to significant fluctuations 
these fluctuations may be due to factors specific to us  to changes in analysts earnings estimates  or to factors affecting the computer  software  internet  entertainment  media or electronics businesses 

table of contents item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to various market risks  including the changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from changes in market rates and prices 
foreign exchange contracts used to hedge foreign currency exposures and short term investments are subject to market risk 
we do not consider our cash and cash equivalents to be subject to interest rate risk due to their short maturities 
we do not enter into derivatives or other financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
foreign currency exchange rate risk we utilize foreign exchange contracts to hedge foreign currency exposures of underlying assets and liabilities  primarily certain intercompany receivables that are denominated in foreign currencies  thereby  limiting our risk 
our foreign exchange contracts are accounted for as derivatives whereby the gains and losses on these contracts are reflected in the consolidated statements of operations 
gains and losses on open contracts at the end of each accounting period resulting from changes in the forward rate are recognized in earnings and are designed to offset gains and losses on the underlying foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities 
at march   we had foreign exchange contracts  all with maturities of less than one month to purchase and sell approximately million in foreign currencies  primarily british pounds  swedish krona  european currency units euro and other currencies 
fair value represents the difference in value of the contracts at the spot rate and the forward rate 
the counterparties to these contracts are substantial and creditworthy multinational commercial banks 
the risks of counterparty nonperformance associated with these contracts are not considered to be material 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage foreign exchange risks  there can be no assurances that our hedging activities will adequately protect us against the risks associated with foreign currency fluctuations 
the following table below provides information about our foreign currency forward exchange contracts at march  the information is provided in us dollar equivalents and presents the notional amount forward amount  the weighted average contractual foreign currency exchange rates and fair value 
weighted average contract contract amount rate fair value in in thousands thousands foreign currency to be sold under contract british pound swedish krona euro japanese yen australian dollar south african rand norwegian krone swiss franc danish krone new zealand dollar brazilian real total foreign currency to be purchased under contract british pound total 
table of contents while the contract amounts provide one measurement of the volume of these transactions  they do not represent the amount of our exposure to credit risk 
the amounts arising from the possible inabilities of counterparties to meet the terms of their contracts are generally limited to the amounts  if any  by which the counterparties obligations exceed our obligations as these contracts can be settled on a net basis at our option 
we control credit risk through credit approvals  limits and monitoring procedures 
interest rate risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we manage our interest rate risk by maintaining an investment portfolio primarily consisting of debt instruments of high credit quality and relatively short average maturities 
we also manage our interest rate risk by maintaining sufficient cash and cash equivalent balances such that we are typically able to hold our investments to maturity 
at march   our cash equivalents and short term investments included debt securities of  million 
notwithstanding our efforts to manage interest rate risks  there can be no assurances that we will be adequately protected against the risks associated with interest rate fluctuations 
the table below presents the amounts and related weighted average interest rates of our investment portfolio at march  average interest rate cost fair value dollars in thousands cash equivalents variable rate short term investments fixed rate see definition in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
maturity dates for short term investments range from months to months with call dates ranging from months to months
