item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion provides information about the major components of the results of operations and financial condition  liquidity  and capital resources of mfc 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies the financial condition and results of operations presented in the consolidated financial statements  accompanying notes to the consolidated financial statements and management s discussion and analysis are  to a large degree  dependent upon the accounting policies of the company 
the selection and application of these accounting policies involve judgments  estimates  and uncertainties that are susceptible to change 
presented below is discussion of those accounting policies that management believes are the most important critical accounting policies to the portrayal and understanding of the company s financial condition and results of operations 
these critical accounting policies require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
in the event that different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  and depending upon the severity of such changes  the possibility of materially different financial condition or results of operations is a reasonable likelihood 
allowance for loan losses the company monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
the company maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of controls over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance they are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan and lease portfolio  and the loan grading system 
the company evaluates various loans individually for impairment as required by statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan  and sfas no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan income recognition and disclosures 
loans evaluated individually for impairment include non performing loans  such as loans on non accrual  loans past due by days or more  restructured loans and other loans selected by management 
the evaluations are based upon discounted expected cash flows or collateral valuations 
if the evaluation shows that a loan is individually impaired  then a specific reserve is established for the amount of impairment 
if a loan evaluated individually is not impaired  then the loan is assessed for impairment under sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies sfas  with a group of loans that have similar characteristics 
for loans without individual measures of impairment  the company makes estimates of losses for groups of loans as required by sfas loans are grouped by similar characteristics  including the type of loan  the assigned loan grade and the general collateral type 
a loss rate reflecting the expected loss inherent in a group of loans is derived based upon estimates of default rates for a given loan grade  the predominant collateral type for the group and the terms of the loan 
the resulting estimate of losses for groups of loans are adjusted for relevant environmental factors and other conditions of the portfolio of loans and leases  including borrower and industry concentrations  levels and trends in delinquencies  charge offs and recoveries  changes in underwriting standards and risk selection  level of experience  ability and depth of lending management  and national and local economic conditions 
the amount of estimated impairment for individually evaluated loans and groups of loans is added together for a total estimate of loans and lease losses 
this estimate of losses is compared to the allowance for loan and lease losses of the company as of the evaluation date and  if the estimate of losses is greater than the allowance  an additional provision to the allowance would be made 
if the estimate of losses is less than the allowance  the degree to which the allowance exceeds the estimate is evaluated to determine whether the allowance falls outside a range of estimates 
if the estimate of losses is below the range of reasonable estimates  the allowance would be reduced by way of a credit to the provision for loan losses 
the company recognizes the inherent imprecision in estimates of losses due to various uncertainties and variability related to the factors used  and therefore a reasonable range around the estimate of losses is derived and used to ascertain whether the allowance is too high 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail and it is determined that the allowance is not adequate to absorb the new estimate of probable losses  an additional provision for loan losses would be made  which amount may be material to the consolidated financial statements 
valuation of derivatives the company maintains an overall interest rate risk management strategy that incorporates the use of derivative financial instruments 
the company has used derivative financial instruments only for asset liability management through the hedging of a specific transaction or position  and not for trading or speculative purposes 
management believes that the risk associated with using derivative financial instruments to mitigate interest rate risk sensitivity is minimal and should not have any material unintended impact on the company s financial condition or results of operations 
intangibles and goodwill the company has approximately million in intangible assets and goodwill at december   an increase of million since december  the increase is associated with the april  acquisition of gilkison patterson investment advisors  inc gpia  a registered investment advisor 
in connection with this investment  a purchase price valuation using fas and as a guideline was completed to determine the appropriate allocation to identified intangibles 
the valuation concluded that approximately of the purchase price was related to the acquisition of customer relationships with an amortizable life of years 
another of the purchase price was allocated to a non compete agreement with an amortizable life of years 
the remainder of the purchase price has been allocated to goodwill 
the purchase price allocation process requires management estimates and judgment as to expectations for the life span of various customer relationships as well as the value that key members of management add to the success of the company 
for example  customer attrition rates were determined based upon assumptions that the past five years may predict the future 
if the actual attrition rates  among other assumptions  differed from the estimates and judgments used in the purchase price allocation  the amounts recorded in the financial statements could result in a possible impairment of the intangible assets and goodwill or require an acceleration in the amortization expense 
in addition  fas requires that goodwill be tested annually using a two step process 
the first step is to identify a potential impairment 
the second step measures the amount of the impairment loss  if any 
processes and procedures have been identified for the two step process 
when the company completes its ongoing review of the recoverability of intangible assets and goodwill  factors that are considered important to determining whether an impairment might exist include loss of customers acquired or significant withdrawals of the assets currently under management and or early retirement or termination of key members of management 
any changes in the key management estimates or judgments could result in an impairment charge  and such a charge could have an adverse effect on the company s financial condition and results of operations

net interest income is the amount by which interest generated from earning assets exceeds the expense of funding those assets 
changes in volume and mix of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  as well as their respective yields and rates  have a significant impact on the level of net interest income

provision for loan losses mfc s loan loss provision during and was  mfc is committed to making loan loss provisions that maintain an allowance that adequately reflects the risk inherent in the loan portfolio 
this commitment is more fully discussed in the asset quality section below 
noninterest income noninterest income has been and will continue to be an important factor for increasing profitability 
management recognizes this and continues to review and consider areas where non interest income can be increased 
noninterest income includes fees generated by the mortgage banking and investment sales departments of the bank as well as by tredegar and gpia 
trust fee income decreased during to million 
a significant portion of trust fees are based upon a percentage of the market value of the assets under management  so any decreases in market value of the assets under management result in a similar decrease in fees 
tredegar s accounts are typically invested in equities with a smaller allocation to fixed income securities 
the continued decline in equity market values have more than offset all of the growth in the fees as result of new business 
gpia s investment advisory fees added million to noninterest income for the eight months that they have been a subsidiary of mfc 
like tredegar  their fees are based upon a percentage of the market value of the assets under management  however  gpia s clients have substantially more invested in fixed income securities 
the fixed income market typically has an opposite reaction to the equity markets 
thus  about of their fee increase over is related to relative increases in market values of the portfolios managed while the remaining is related to new business growth 
due to historic low mortgage rates and increased refinancings  the mortgage banking department contributed an additional  of fees on loans held for sale during during  the bank increased its transaction oriented deposit accounts by resulting in growth in service charges and fee income 
the service charges and fees associated with deposit accounts increased during during  mfc realized  in net losses as a result of restructuring the investment portfolio in response to the change in the interest rate environment in total noninterest income for was million  compared to million for noninterest income for increased to million from million in the increase is due primarily to the increase on fees on loans held for sale  investment sales fees and service charges on deposit accounts 
the mortgage banking department contributed an additional  of fees on loans held for sale during the service charges and fees associated with deposit accounts increased during the increase in these fees was due primarily to a increase in transaction oriented deposit account growth

total noninterest expenses increased or million to million in the acquisition of gpia on april  accounts for or million of the total increase in noninterest expenses 
salaries and employee benefits increased million or due to increased commission expense for fee related business and enhancing the internal infrastructure to support a growing organization 
approximately  of the million increase in salaries expense is related to the acquisition of gpia 
occupancy and equipment expense increased  or to million 
the costs to move the existing operations departments from the company s main office to the operations facility as well as readying the buildings for occupancy have caused the increase in occupancy and equipment expense 
advertising expense increased in two additional bank mergers within the market areas presented opportunities for additional image advertising that resulted in increased business 
computer operations expense increased to  during the company placed in service additional equipment to enhance the security infrastructure of the internal network as well as upgraded the core bank processing software 
an increase in the usage of internet banking services by accountholders also contributed to the increase in computer operations expense 
other operating expenses increased  to million for compared to million for expenses associated with servicing an increased volume of accounts and transactions such as postage and printing have also impacted other operating expenses in noninterest expenses increased or million to million in this increase resulted from both pressures to provide competitive salary and benefit programs and occupancy and equipment investments to position the bank for future growth and productivity

at december   residential real estate family portfolio loans constituted of the total portfolio and decreased million during the year 
the current historic low mortgage interest rates have caused many of the bank s clients to refinance to a long term fixed rate product 
real estate construction loans consist primarily of pre sold family residential loans along with a marginal amount of commercial construction loans 
real estate construction loans increased to million at december  and represent of the total loan portfolio 
mfc s one time closing construction permanent loan product competes successfully in a high growth market like loudoun county because mfc is local and can respond quickly to inspections and construction draw requests 
non farm  non residential real estate loans are typically owner occupied commercial buildings 
non farm  non residential loans were of the total loan portfolio at december  the increase in the non farm non residential real estate loans is the result of an increased focus on diversifying the loan portfolio 
the bank has hired commercial business development officers who have been successful in attracting new business to the bank 
the branch network has also helped to support the loan portfolio diversification  such as increased commercial real estate loans 
home equity lines and agricultural real estate loans were and of total loans  respectively  at december  mfc s commercial  financial and agricultural loan portfolio consists of secured and unsecured loans to small businesses 
at december   these loans comprised of the loan portfolio

generally business debt has declined nationwide as well as locally thus causing a decrease in loan demand 
consumer installment loans primarily consist of unsecured installment credit and account for of the loan portfolio 
consistent with its focus on providing community based financial services  mfc generally does not extend loans outside its principal market area 
mfc s market area for its lending services encompasses fauquier and loudoun counties  where it operates full service branches 
mfc s unfunded loan commitments totaled million at december  and million at december  the decrease in the amount of unfunded commitments is attributed in part to the increase in real estate construction financing as well as customer demand for credit line products  primarily home equity lines 
at december   mfc had no concentration of loans in any one industry in excess of of its total loan portfolio

these include underwriting standards for new originations and ongoing monitoring and reporting of asset quality and adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
total nonperforming assets  which consist of nonaccrual loans  restructured loans and foreclosed property  were million at december  this is an increase of  from the december  balance of  the increase is largely two residential real estate loans both of which are well secured 
nonperforming assets at december  decreased  from  at december  nonperforming assets loans are placed on nonaccrual status when collection of principal and interest is doubtful  generally when a loan becomes days past due 
there are three negative implications for earnings when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status 
first  all interest accrued but unpaid at the date that the loan is placed on nonaccrual status is either deducted from interest income or written off as a loss 
second  accruals of interest are discontinued until it becomes certain that both principal and interest can be repaid 
finally  there may be actual losses that require additional provisions for loan losses be charged against earnings 
for real estate loans  upon foreclosure  the balance of the loan is transferred to other real estate owned oreo and carried at the lower of the outstanding loan balance or the fair market value of the property based on current appraisals and other current market trends 
if a write down of the oreo property is necessary at the time of foreclosure  the amount is charged off against the allowance for loan losses 
a review of the recorded property value is performed in conjunction with normal loan reviews  and if market conditions indicate that the recorded value exceeds the fair market value  additional write downs of the property value are charged directly to operations

the allowance for loan losses was of nonperforming loans at december  at december  and the allowance for loan losses was  and  of nonperforming loans 
management evaluates nonperforming loans relative to their collateral value and makes appropriate reductions in the carrying value of those loans based on that review 
allowance for loan losses the company monitors and maintains an allowance for loan losses to absorb an estimate of probable losses inherent in the loan and lease portfolio 
the company maintains policies and procedures that address the systems of controls over the following areas of maintenance of the allowance the systematic methodology used to determine the appropriate level of the allowance to provide assurance they are maintained in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  the accounting policies for loan charge offs and recoveries  the assessment and measurement of impairment in the loan and lease portfolio  and the loan grading system

the allocation of the allowance as shown in the table above should not be interpreted as an indication that loan losses in future years will occur in the same proportions that they may have in prior years or that the allocation indicates future loan loss trends 
additionally  the proportion allocated to each loan category is not the total amount that may be available for the future losses that could occur within such categories since the total allowance is a general allowance applicable to the total portfolio 
securities mfc manages its investment securities portfolio consistent with established policies that include guidelines for earnings  rate sensitivity  liquidity and pledging needs

this standard requires classification of investments into three categories  held to maturity htm  available for sale afs  or trading  as further defined in note to the company s consolidated financial statements 
mfc s does not maintain a trading account and has classified no securities in this category 
htm securities are required to be carried on the financial statements at amortized cost 
afs securities are carried on the financial statements at fair value 
the unrealized gains or losses  net of deferred income taxes  are reflected in shareholders equity 
the htm classification places restrictions on mfc s ability to sell securities or to transfer securities into the afs classification 
since mfc desires the flexibility to respond to changing balance sheet needs through investment portfolio management  it has chosen to classify only a small portion of its portfolio in this category 
at december   of the portfolio was classified as htm 
mfc holds in its loan and securities portfolios investments that adjust or float according to changes in prime lending rate 
these holdings are not considered speculative but instead necessary for good asset liability management 
the carrying value of the securities portfolio was million at december   an increase of million or from the carrying value of million at december  the market value of the afs securities at december  was million 
the unrealized loss on the afs securities was  that was more than offset by an unrealized gain of million at december  the net market value gain at december  is reflective of the recent decrease in market interest rates

the securities portfolio represents approximately of the earning assets of mfc 
for that reason  it is managed primarily to provide superior returns without sacrificing interest rate  market and credit risk

fluctuations in federal funds sold and money market investments reflect excess deposit growth over loan growth as well as management s goal to maximize asset yields while maintaining proper asset liability structure 
deposits deposits continue to be an important funding source and primary supply of mfc s growth 
mfc s strategy has been to increase its core deposits at the same time that it is controlling its cost of funds 
the maturation of the branch network  as well as increased advertising campaigns and bank mergers  have contributed to the significant growth in deposits over the last several years

the total number of net new deposit transactional excluding time deposits accounts have increased per year for the past two years 
mfc will continue to fund assets primarily with deposits and will focus on core deposit growth as the primary source of liquidity and stability 
mfc offers individuals and small to medium sized businesses a variety of deposit accounts  including demand and interest checking  money market  savings and time deposit accounts

the federal reserve board has established minimum regulatory capital standards for bank holding companies and state member banks 
the regulatory capital standards categorize assets and off balance sheet items into four categories that weigh balance sheet assets according to risk  requiring more capital for holding higher risk assets 
the minimum ratio of qualifying total capital to risk weighted assets is  of which at least must be tier capital  composed of common equity and retained earnings 
mfc had a ratio of total capital to risk weighted assets of at december   compared to at december  the ratio of tier capital to risk weighted assets was and at december  and  respectively 
both ratios exceed the minimum capital requirements adopted by the federal banking regulatory agencies

recent accounting pronouncements in december   the american institute of certified public accountants aicpa issued statement of position  accounting by certain entities including entities with trade receivables that lend to or finance the activities of others  to reconcile and conform the accounting and financial reporting provisions established by various aicpa industry audit guides 
this statement is effective for annual and interim financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
on march   the financial accounting standard board determined that commitments for the origination of mortgage loans that will be held for sale must be accounted for as derivatives instruments  effective for fiscal quarters beginning after april  the bank enters into commitments to originate loans whereby the interest rate on the loan is determined prior to funding 
such rate lock commitments on mortgage loans to be sold in the secondary market are considered derivatives 
accordingly  these commitments including any fees received from the potential borrower are recorded at fair value in derivative assets or liabilities  with changes in fair value recorded in the net gain or loss on sale of mortgage loans 
fair value is based on fees currently charged to enter into similar agreements  and for fixed rate commitments also considers the difference between current levels of interest rates and the committed rates 
the cumulative effect of adopting statement no 
for rate lock commitments as of december   was not material 
the company originally adopted statement no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities on january  in april  the financial accounting standards board issued statement  rescission of fasb no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the amendment to statement eliminates an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
the provisions of this statement related to the rescission of statement shall be applied in fiscal years beginning after may  the provisions of this statement related to statement are effective for transactions occurring after may   with early application encouraged 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires recognition of a liability  when incurred  for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity 
the liability should be measured at fair value 
the provisions of the statement are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  effective january   the corporation adopted financial accounting standards board statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
accordingly  goodwill is no longer subject to amortization over its estimated useful life  but is subject to at least an annual assessment for impairment by applying a fair value based test 
additionally  statement requires that acquired intangible assets such as core deposit intangibles be separately recognized if the benefit of the asset can be sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged  and amortized over their estimated useful life 
branch acquisition transactions were outside the scope of the statement and therefore any intangible asset arising from such transactions remained subject to amortization over their estimated useful life 
in october  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 acquisitions of certain financial institutions 
the statement amends previous interpretive guidance on the application of the purchase method of accounting to acquisitions of financial institutions  and requires the application of statement no 
 business combinations  and statement no 
to branch acquisitions if such transactions meet the definition of a business combination 
the provisions of the statement do not apply to transactions between two or more mutual enterprises 
in addition  the statement amends statement no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets  to include in its scope core deposit intangibles of financial institutions 
accordingly  such intangibles are subject to a recoverability test based on undiscounted cash flows  and to the impairment recognition and measurement provisions required for other long lived assets held and used 
the adoption of statement nos

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk is the risk of loss in a financial instrument arising from adverse changes in market rates or prices such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices and equity prices 
mfc s primary market risk exposure is interest rate risk  though it should be noted that the assets under management by tredegar are affected by equity price risk 
the ongoing monitoring and management of this risk is an important component of mfc s asset liability management process  which is governed by policies established by its board of directors that are reviewed and approved annually 
the board of directors delegates responsibility for carrying out asset liability management policies to the asset liability committee alco of the bank 
in this capacity  alco develops guidelines and strategies that govern mfc s asset liability management related activities  based upon estimated market risk sensitivity  policy limits and overall market interest rate levels and trends 
interest rate risk represents the sensitivity of earnings to changes in market interest rates 
as interest rates change  the interest income and expense streams associated with mfc s financial instruments also change  affecting net interest income  the primary component of mfc s earnings 
alco uses the results of a detailed and dynamic simulation model to quantify the estimated exposure of net interest income to sustained interest rate changes 
while alco routinely monitors simulated net interest income sensitivity over a rolling two year horizon  it also employs additional tools to monitor potential longer term interest rate risk 
the simulation model captures the impact of changing interest rates on the interest income received and interest expense paid on all assets and liabilities reflected on mfc s balance sheet 
the simulation model is prepared and updated four times during each year 
this sensitivity analysis is compared to alco policy limits  which specify a maximum tolerance level for net interest income exposure over a one year horizon  assuming no balance sheet growth  given both a basis point bp upward and downward shift in interest rates 
a parallel and pro rata shift in rates over a month period is assumed 
given the current historic low in interest rates for the fiscal year  the model assumed only a bp decrease in interest rates 
the following reflects the range of mfc s net interest income sensitivity analysis during the fiscal years of and as compared to the board approved policy limit 
rate change estimated net interest income sensitivity high low average bp bp 
rate change estimated net interest income sensitivity high low average bp 
bp at the end of  mfc s interest rate risk model indicated that in a rising rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could decrease by on average 
for the same time period the interest rate risk model indicated that in a declining rate environment of basis points over a month period net interest income could increase by on average 
while these numbers are subjective based upon the parameters used within the model  management believes the balance sheet is very balanced with little risk to rising rates in the future 
during  mfc was able to test the parameters and assumptions of its simulation model in light of the decrease in short term rates over months 
the simulation model proved to be accurate in its presentation of a company that benefits from falling interest rates 
as presented in the table above  mfc has had minimal interest rate risks to either falling or rising interest rates over the past two years 
mfc could expect a negative impact to net interest income of  if rates rise basis points over the next months 
if rates decline basis points  mfc could expect a positive impact to net interest income of  over the next months 
during may  mfc entered into two interest rate swap agreements to assume variable market indexed interest payments in exchange for fixed rate interest payments 
the interest rate swap was used to offset the cost of offering a premium market rate on a promotional retail certificate of deposit 
mfc raised million in new deposits during this three day promotion 
the terms of the certificate of deposit and the fixed portion of the interest rate swap are identical 
the notional principal amount of interest rate swaps outstanding was million at december  the original term was months and matured in may the weighted average fixed payment rate was throughout the term 
variable interest payments received were based on three month libor the effect of these agreements was to transform the certificates of deposit fixed rate liabilities to variable rate certificates of deposit liabilities 
the net income from these agreements was  for the year ended december  the preceding sensitivity analysis does not represent an mfc forecast and should not be relied upon as being indicative of expected operating results 
these hypothetical estimates are based upon numerous assumptions  including the nature and timing of interest rate levels including yield curve shape  prepayments on loans and securities  deposit decay rates  pricing decisions on loans and deposits  reinvestment or replacement of asset and liability cashflows 
while assumptions are developed based upon current economic and local market conditions  mfc cannot make any assurances about the predictive nature of these assumptions  including how customer preferences or competitor influences might change 
also  as market conditions vary from those assumed in the sensitivity analysis  actual results will also differ due to factors such as prepayment and refinancing levels likely deviating from those assumed  the varying impact of interest rate change  caps or floors on adjustable rate assets  the potential effect of changing debt service levels on customers with adjustable rate loans  depositor early withdrawals and product preference changes  and other internal and external variables 
furthermore  the sensitivity analysis does not reflect actions that alco might take in response to or anticipation of changes in interest rates
