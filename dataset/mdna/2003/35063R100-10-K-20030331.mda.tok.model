overview founded in  foundry designs  develops  manufactures and markets a comprehensive  end to end suite of high performance ethernet layer and layer switches  metro routers and internet traffic management products for enterprises  educational institutions  government agencies  web hosting companies  application service providers asps  electronic banking and finance service providers  and internet service providers isps 
our product suite includes the netiron family of metro routers  fastiron family of ethernet edge switches  edgeiron layer ethernet switches  bigiron family of gigabit ethernet core switches and serveriron family of ethernet layer internet traffic management switches 
in june  we introduced a series of new products which incorporate the jetcore asic chipset which consists of different asics that provide various combinations of or gigabit ethernet ports to deliver advanced switching and routing functionalities 
built on micron technology  the jetcore chipset represents the third major asic development from foundry in a four year span 
purpose built to meet the feature  performance and scalability needs of the high bandwidth enterprise  metro and internet networks  foundry s jetcore chipset is the foundation of foundry s next generation switching and routing platforms 
for the past two years  we have operated in a difficult economic environment  particularly in the us  as our customers reduced or deferred spending on capital equipment 
for the year ended december   we generated net income of million or per diluted share on revenues of million 
these results compare to net income of million or per diluted share on revenues of million in the decrease in revenues reflects the negative impact of difficult economic conditions on our revenues mitigated  in part  by greater customer acceptance of our new product offerings based on the jetcore asic which stabilized the revenue decline we experienced since despite slightly lower revenues in  we generated significantly higher net income in as a result of our efforts to carefully manage our headcount  control discretionary spending  and aggressively manage our accounts receivable and inventories 
we completed with quarter over quarter revenue growth and remained profitable throughout despite the challenging economic environment 
the depressed economic conditions and political instability in asia and the middle east have created and may continue to create a reluctance by our customers to resume or increase capital spending 
despite the uncertainty of the current business environment  we remain focused on our long term strategy of maintaining profitability and positive cash flows by focusing on innovation  competitively pricing our products and prudent financial management 
despite the weak economic environment  foundry has continued to deliver on its business model  which centers on the introduction of industry leading products and careful expense control 
our execution on this model allowed the company to improve its financial results on a quarter over quarter basis throughout  increasing revenue  and improving gross margins and operating profits 
management remains committed to improving the company s financial performance  however  there is no certainty we will be able to maintain or further improve results 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of our consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the period reported 
by their nature  these estimates and judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management bases their estimates and judgments on historical experience  market trends  and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
these and other significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this form k 
revenue recognition we derive a significant amount of revenue from sales of stackable and chassis based networking equipment  with the remaining revenue generated from customer support fees  training and installation services 
foundry s revenue recognition policy follows sec staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
specifically  foundry recognizes revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the sales price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
product revenue is generally recorded at the time of shipment when title and risk of loss passes to the customer  unless we have future obligations for installation or have to obtain customer acceptance  in which case revenue is not recorded until such obligations have been satisfied or customer acceptance has been received 
revenue is not recognized when the customer has a right of return or when undelivered products or services are essential to the functionality of delivered products 
at the time revenue is recognized  foundry establishes an accrual for estimated warranty expenses associated with its sales  recorded as a component of cost of revenue 
foundry s standard warranty period extends months from the date of sale and the warranty accrual represents the best estimate of the amounts necessary to settle future and existing claims on products sold as of the balance sheet date 
while foundry believes that the warranty accrual is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such estimates could differ materially from actual warranty costs in the future 
if the company s actual warranty costs are greater than the accrual  cost of revenues will increase in the future 
foundry also provides a reserve for estimated customer returns 
this provision is based on the historical returns  analysis of credit memo data and return policies 
sales to foundry s resellers do not provide for rights of return and the contracts with foundry s original equipment manufacturers do not provide for rights of return except in the event foundry s products do not meet specifications or there has been an epidemic failure  as defined in the agreements 
if the historical data used by the company to calculate the estimated sales returns and allowances does not properly reflect future returns  revenue could be misstated 
support services are offered under renewable  annual fee based contracts or as part of multiple element arrangements 
when support services are sold under multiple element arrangements  the company allocates revenue to each element based upon its relative fair value and recognizes the revenue for each element when the revenue recognition criteria have been met for each element 
fair value is generally determined based on the price charged when the element is sold separately 
revenue from customer support contracts is deferred and recognized ratably over the contractual period  generally one to five years 
a total of million of support revenue was deferred on the accompanying balance sheet as of december  other service revenue for training and installation services is recognized as services are rendered 
allowance for doubtful accounts we actively manage our accounts receivable to minimize credit risk 
we typically sell to customers for which there is a history of successful collection 
new customers are subjected to a credit review process  which evaluates the customers financial position and ability to pay 
new customers are typically assigned a credit limit based on a formulated review of their financial position 
such credit limits are only increased after a successful collection history with the customer has been established 
we continually monitor and evaluate the collectibility of our trade receivables based on a combination of factors 
we record specific allowances for doubtful accounts when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligation to us such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration of financial position 
estimates are used in determining our allowances for all other customers based on factors such as current trends  the length of time the receivables are past due and historical collection experience 
we mitigate some collection risk by requiring some international customers to secure letters of credit or bank guarantees prior to placing an order with us 
while we believe that our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is adequate and that the judgment applied is appropriate  such amounts estimated could differ materially from what will actually transpire in the future 
inventories the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
our inventory purchases and commitments are made in order to build inventory to meet future shipment schedules based on forecasted demand for our products 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory each period  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments to inventory for excess  obsolescence or impairment  when appropriate  to reflect inventory at net realizable value 
revisions to our inventory adjustments may be required if actual demand  component costs or product life cycles differ from our estimates 
we subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to companies that assemble and test our products 
our agreements with some of these companies allow them to procure long lead time component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast provided by foundry with lead times of up to months 
foundry may be contractually obligated to the purchase of long lead time component inventory procured by certain contract manufacturers in accordance with the forecast  unless foundry gives notice of order cancellation at least days prior to the delivery date 
as of december   the company was potentially committed to purchase approximately million of such inventory 
if actual demand of our products is below the projections  we may have excess inventory as a result of our purchase commitments of long lead time components with our contract manufacturers 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required in determining any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
management makes an assessment of the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent that recovery is not believed to be more likely than not  a valuation allowance is established 
for the years ended december  and  we did not record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets because we believe the amount is more likely than not to be realized 
in the event foundry is unable to realize some or all of its deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
our net deferred tax assets as of december  and were million and million  respectively 
legal contingencies we are subject to the possibility of loss contingencies in the normal course of our business  including those related to intellectual property and securities litigation 
a loss contingency is accrued when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we continually reassess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to our contingencies  as well as potential ranges of probable losses  and will recognize a liability  if any  for these contingencies based on a careful analysis of each issue with the assistance of outside legal counsel and other experts 
for further detail  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for a description of our legal proceedings 
results of operations net revenues the following table shows product and service net revenues for the years ended december    and in thousands year ended december  of net revenues of net revenues of net revenues net revenues product service total net revenues product net revenues were million  million  and million in   and  respectively  representing a decrease of in and a decrease of in the decreases were the result of reductions to our average selling prices in response to competitive pressures as a result of the continued economic slowdown 
these adverse effects continued in  but their effect on product revenues in were lessened  to an extent  by increased sales volume due to strong customer acceptance of our new jetcore based product offerings that began shipping in service revenues consist primarily of revenue from customer support contracts  and to a lesser extent  from providing professional and educational services 
service net revenues were million  million and million and accounted for  and in  and  respectively 
the increases were due to a higher installed base of our networking equipment each year as customers purchased new support contracts associated with their equipment purchases and renewed their maintenance contracts on existing equipment 
customer support contracts range from years  but a majority are for one year periods 
revenues from support contracts are recognized ratably over the service period 
for the year ended december   one customer accounted for greater than of our revenues 
sales to mitsui in japan accounted for of our revenues in for the years ended december  and  no customer accounted for greater than of our revenues 
domestic sales within the united states accounted for   and in  and  respectively 
outside of the united states  one country  japan  accounted for of revenues in no individual country outside of the united states accounted for greater than of revenues in or gross margins the following table shows gross margins for product and service revenues and the related gross margin percentages for the years ended december    and in thousands year ended december  gross margin gross margin gross margin gross margins product service total gross margin our cost of product revenues consists primarily of material  labor  manufacturing overhead  warranty costs  and the provision for inventory 
product gross margins were million  million  and million in   and or   and of product net revenues  respectively 
the increase in product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues in was due to lower inventory provisions of million in compared to million in and the mix of products sold 
the significant decrease in product gross margin as a percentage of product revenues from to was due to a combination of decreased product revenues  as a result of lower average selling prices in response to competitive pressures  and significantly higher inventory provisions in response to the depressed economic environment and a major product line transition in the fourth quarter of the provision for inventory increased from million in to million in  of which million was recorded in fourth quarter to specifically reserve for excess inventories as a result of our product realignment and transition from our ironcore asics based product lines to the new and more powerful products incorporating our next generation jetcore asics 
during  we physically disposed of million of the previously reserved obsolete products as a result of the product transition 
our cost of service revenues consists primarily of costs of providing services under customer support contracts 
these costs include service material costs  labor  and manufacturing overhead 
service gross margins were in and in  and in service gross margin decreased in due to the write off of service inventory that was outstanding at customer sites 
many of these customers ceased operations during due to the economic recession and  as a result  foundry was unable to recover the service inventory 
our gross margins have sequentially improved in each quarter of the rate of gross margin improvement has been and may continue to be adversely affected by heightened price competition  component shortages  increases in material or labor costs  excess  obsolete  and impaired inventory charges  changes in channels of distribution  customer  product and geographic mix  or an increase in product costs 
see also risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock our gross margins may decline over time and the average selling prices of our products may decrease as a result of competitive pressures and other factors 
research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses the following table shows research and development  sales and marketing  and general and administrative expenses for the years ended december    and in thousands year ended december  of net revenues of net revenues of net revenues research and development sales and marketing general and administrative research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and related personnel expenses  prototype materials and expenses related to the development of our asics  software development and testing costs  and the depreciation of property and equipment related to research and development activities 
research and development expenses were million  million and million in  and or   and of revenue  respectively 
the million increase in research and development expenses from to was due to an increase in headcount from an average of engineers during to during offset by a reduction in prototype expenses as a result of the completion of the development of our next generation jetcore asics in the increase in research and development expenses of from to was due to headcount increases and increased expenditures on the design and development of new products  in particular  the development of jetcore asics in we believe continued investment in product enhancements and new product development is critical to attaining our strategic objectives  and as a result  we expect research and development expenses to continue to increase in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and customer support functions  as well as trade shows  advertising  promotional expenses and the cost of facilities 
sales and marketing expenses were million  million and million in  and or  and of revenue  respectively 
the decrease in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to a reduction in the average size of our direct sales force from in to in the increase in absolute dollars from to was primarily due to increases in the average size of our direct sales force from in to in  and increased marketing and advertising investments associated with the introduction of new products 
we believe that continued investment in sales and marketing is critical to our success and expect these expenses to slightly increase in absolute dollars in as we initiate additional sales and marketing programs to support our products 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance and administrative personnel  facilities  bad debt  legal  and other general corporate expenses 
general and administrative expenses were million  million and million in  and or  and of revenue  respectively 
the increase in absolute dollars in was primarily due to certain charges such as million for the write down of a note receivable from a stockholder  million of costs related to facilities consolidation  and increases in legal and facilities expenses 
included in general and administrative expenses was the provision for doubtful accounts receivable which totaled  in  million in and million in the increase in the provision during was due to the adverse impact of the economic recession on our customer base 
we expect general and administrative expenses will increase slightly in  compared to amortization of deferred stock compensation 
in connection with the grant of stock options to employees and a director  we recorded deferred stock compensation in the aggregate amount of million in  and million in  representing the difference between the exercise price and the deemed fair market value of our common stock on the date these stock options were granted 
we recorded no additional deferred stock compensation in or deferred stock compensation is reflected within stockholders equity and is being amortized to operations over the respective vesting period of the options 
we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation expense of approximately million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
at december   we had approximately million remaining to be amortized in interest income 
interest income is earned on funds we keep on deposit in interest bearing money market and short term investment accounts 
foundry had interest income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
interest income has decreased due to continually declining interest rates since january see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a description of our investment policy 
write down of minority investment 
in february  foundry made a million minority investment in a development stage private company  who was also a customer 
total sales to this customer were insignificant 
in december  the company determined that the investment s decline in fair market value was other than temporary based on certain factors such as the value of the most recent round of financing  market and industry conditions and financial condition of and business outlook for the company 
accordingly  foundry wrote down the minority investment in its entirety in the accompanying consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  income taxes 
the effective tax rates for each of the years ended december   and was  and  respectively 
the amounts reflect the federal statutory and state tax rates  offset by research and development tax credits  foreign sales corporation tax benefits  and tax exempt interest income 
the company s income taxes payable for federal and state purposes have been reduced  and the deferred tax assets increased  by the tax benefits associated with taxable dispositions of employee stock options 
when an employee exercises a stock option issued under a nonqualified plan or has a disqualifying disposition related to a qualified plan  the company receives an income tax benefit calculated as the difference between the fair market value of the stock issued at the time of the exercise and the option price  tax effected 
these benefits were credited directly to stockholders equity and amounted to million  million and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
management believes that the company will likely generate sufficient taxable income in the future to realize the tax benefits arising from its existing deferred tax assets 
therefore  no valuation allowance was required as of december   and liquidity and capital resources at december   foundry had cash and cash equivalents and short term investments totaling million as compared to million at december   an increase of million 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided by operating activities in consisted of net income of million adjusted for non cash items of million  and net cash provided by changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
non cash items of million in consisted primarily of a provision for inventory of million  depreciation of million  and the tax benefit from stock option exercises totaling million 
cash provided by operating activities in was comprised of million adjusted for non cash items of  and net cash used for changes in operating assets and liabilities of million 
the increase in cash provided by operating activities in was primarily due to higher net income generated in the decrease in cash provided by operating activities in was due to the economic recession which resulted in significantly lower net income of million 
cash provided by operating activities of million in was a result of significantly higher net income of million  a non cash tax benefit from stock option exercises of million offset by million of inventory purchases and an increase in accounts receivable of million 
cash provided primarily by net maturities of short term investments was million in this compares to cash utilized primarily in the net purchase of short term investments of million and million in and  respectively 
the fluctuations in investing activities were due to the shift between the company s purchases of short term investments and cash generated from the maturities of these short term investments 
all investments are classified as held to maturity 
during  the company reinvested significantly more of the proceeds from short term investments into highly liquid cash equivalents rather than into other short term investments as compared to and see item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a description of our investment policy 
financing activities in generated million of cash  arising from the issuance of common stock to employees through stock option exercises and the employee stock purchase plan 
in  we utilized million for financing activities  which comprised primarily of million used for the repurchase of foundry common stock in the open market offset by million of proceeds from the issuance of common stock to employees 
financing activities in generated million primarily from the issuance of common stock to employees  and to a lesser extent  the collection of stockholder promissory notes 
the following table summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods in thousands total less than year years greater than years operating leases purchase commitments with our contract manufacturers total contractual cash obligations although it is difficult for us to predict future liquidity requirements with certainty  we believe that our existing cash balances and anticipated funds from operations  will satisfy our cash requirements for at least the next months 
key factors impacting our cash flows include our ability to effectively manage our working capital  in particular inventory and accounts receivable  as well as future demand for our products and related pricing 
we may incur higher capital expenditures in the near future  when market conditions improve and if we expand our operations 
although we do not have any current plans or commitments to do so  from time to time  we may also consider the acquisition of products and businesses complementary to our business 
any acquisition or investment may require additional capital 
recently issued accounting standards accounting for stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas that amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to sfas s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas and apb opinion no

the statement s amendment of the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we do no expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
foundry has elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  to account for employee stock options 
guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including loan guarantees such as standby letters of credit 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair market value of the obligations it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of fin apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements or interim or annual periods ending after december  and are applicable to foundry s product warranty liability see note below to the consolidated financial statements 
foundry s adoption of fin is not expected to have a material impact on its results of operations and financial position 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  foundry is currently evaluating the effect that the adoption of eitf issue no 
will have on its results of operations and financial condition 
accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized and measured initially at fair value only when the liability is incurred 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  foundry s adoption of sfas is not expected to have a significant impact on its operating results and financial condition 
risk factors that may affect future results and market price of stock we may not be able to maintain profitability 
we generated net income of million for the year ended december  on revenues of million 
as of december   we had retained earnings of million 
when economic conditions improve  we may incur increased costs and expenses related to sales and marketing  including expansion of our direct sales operation and distribution channels  product development  customer support  expansion of our corporate infrastructure  and facilities expansion 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated revenue trends and a high percentage of our expenses are fixed in the short term 
as a result  any significant shortfall in revenue relative to our expectations could cause a significant decline in our quarterly operating results 
in order to be profitable  we must generate and sustain substantially higher revenue while maintaining reasonable cost and expense levels 
we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis in the future 
weak economic and market conditions and geopolitical turmoil may adversely affect our revenues  gross margins and expenses 
our quarterly revenue and operating results have and may continue to fluctuate due to the effects of general economic conditions in the united states and globally  and  in particular  market conditions in the communications and networking industries 
in the last several years  our operating results have been adversely affected as a result of the overall economic slowdown and reduced capital spending by businesses 
we are uncertain about the extent and length of the economic downturn 
additionally  the current political turmoil in many parts of the world  including terrorist and military actions  may continue to weaken the global economy 
if the economic conditions in the united states and globally do not improve  or if we experience a worsening in the global economic slowdown  we may continue to experience material negative effects on our business  operating results and financial condition 
because our financial results are difficult to predict  we may not meet quarterly financial expectations  which could cause our stock price to decline 
our quarterly revenue and operating results are difficult to predict  especially in recent periods  and may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
delays in generating or recognizing forecasted revenue could cause our quarterly operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the price of our common stock to fall 
in addition  demand for our products may fluctuate as a result of seasonality  particularly in europe 
we may experience a delay in generating or recognizing revenue for a number of reasons 
orders at the beginning of each quarter typically do not equal expected revenue for that quarter and are generally cancelable at any time prior to shipment 
therefore  we depend on obtaining orders in a quarter for shipment in that quarter to achieve our revenue objectives 
in addition  the failure to ship products by the end of a quarter may negatively affect our operating results 
our reseller agreements typically provide that the reseller may delay scheduled delivery dates without penalty 
further  our customer purchase orders and reseller agreements sometimes provide that the customer or reseller may cancel orders within specified time frames without significant penalty 
because of the uncertain nature of the economic environment and rapidly changing market we serve  period to period comparisons of operating results may not be meaningful 
in addition  you may not be able to rely on the results for any period as an indication of future performance 
in the future  our revenue may remain flat  decrease or grow 
as a consequence  operating results for a particular quarter are extremely difficult to predict 
although our customer base has increased substantially  we still depend on large  recurring purchases from certain customers  and a loss  cancellation or delay in purchases by these customers could negatively impact our revenue 
sales to our ten largest customers accounted for and of total revenues in and  respectively 
the loss of continued orders from our more significant customers could cause our revenue and profitability to suffer 
our ability to attract new customers will depend on a variety of factors  including the cost effectiveness  reliability  scalability  breadth and depth of our products 
while our financial performance may depend on large  recurring orders from certain customers and resellers  we do not generally have binding commitments from them 
for example our reseller agreements generally do not require minimum purchases  our customers can stop purchasing and our resellers can stop marketing our products at any time  our reseller agreements generally are not exclusive and are for one year terms  with no obligation of the resellers to renew the agreements  and our reseller agreements provide for discounts based on expected or actual volumes of products purchased or resold by the reseller in a given period 
because our expenses are based on our revenue forecasts  a substantial reduction or delay in sales of our products to  or unexpected returns from customers and resellers  or the loss of any significant customer or reseller could harm our business 
although our largest customers may vary from period to period  we anticipate that our operating results for any given period will continue to depend on large orders from a small number of customers 
intense competition in the market for network solutions could prevent us from maintaining or increasing revenue and sustaining profitability 
the market for network solutions is intensely competitive 
in particular  cisco systems inc maintains a dominant position in this market and several of its products compete directly with our products 
cisco s substantial resources and market dominance have enabled it to reduce prices on its products within a short period of time following the introduction of these products  which reduces the margins and  therefore  the profitability of its competitors 
purchasers of networking solutions may choose cisco s products because of its longer operating history  broader product line and strong reputation in the networking market 
in addition  cisco may have developed or could in the future develop new technologies that directly compete with our products or render our products obsolete 
although we are currently among the top providers of network infrastructure solutions  we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against cisco  currently the leading provider in the networking market 
we also compete with other companies  such as extreme networks  juniper networks  riverstone networks  nortel networks  and enterasys networks 
some of our current and potential competitors have greater market leverage  longer operating histories  greater financial  technical  sales  marketing and other resources  more name recognition and larger installed customer bases 
additionally  we may face competition from unknown companies and emerging technologies that may offer new lan  man and lan wan solutions to enterprises and isps 
furthermore  a number of these competitors may merge or form strategic relationships that would enable them to apply greater resources and sales coverage than we can and to offer  or bring to market earlier  products that are superior to ours in terms of features  quality  pricing or other factors 
in order to remain competitive  we must  among other things  invest significant resources in developing new products with superior performance at lower prices than our competitors  and we must enhance our current products and maintain customer satisfaction 
in addition  we must make certain our sales and marketing capabilities allow us to effectively compete against our competitors 
if we fail to do so  our products may not compete favorably with those of our competitors and our revenue and profitability could suffer 
our ability to increase our revenue depends on expanding our direct sales operation and reseller distribution channels and continuing to provide excellent customer support 
if we are unable to effectively develop and retain our sales and support staff or establish and cultivate relationships with our indirect distribution channels  our ability to grow and increase revenue could be harmed 
additionally  if our resellers are not successful in their sales efforts  sales of our products may decrease and our operating results could suffer 
some of our resellers also sell products that compete with our products 
as a result  we cannot assure you that our resellers will market our products effectively or continue to devote the resources necessary to provide us with adequate sales  marketing and technical support 
in an effort to gain market share and support our customers  we may need to expand our direct sales operation and customer service staff to support new and existing customers 
the timing and extent of any such expansion is uncertain in light of the current economic environment 
expansion of our direct sales operation and reseller distribution channels may not be successfully implemented and the cost of any expansion may exceed the revenue generated 
we must continue to introduce new products with superior performance in a timely manner in order to sustain and increase our revenue 
the networking industry is characterized by rapid technological change  frequent new product introductions  changes in customer requirements  and evolving industry standards 
therefore  we need to introduce new products in a timely manner that offer substantially greater performance and support a greater number of users per device  all at lower price points to remain competitive 
the process of developing new technology is complex and uncertain  and if we fail to develop or obtain important intellectual property and accurately predict customers changing needs and emerging technological trends  our business could be harmed 
we must commit significant resources to develop new products before knowing whether our investments will eventually result in products that the market will accept 
after a product is developed  we must be able to forecast sales volumes and quickly manufacture a sufficient mix of products and configurations that meet customer requirements  all at low costs 
the current life cycle of our products is typically to months 
the introduction of new products or product enhancements may shorten the life cycle of our existing products  replace sales of some of our current products  thereby offsetting the benefit of even a successful product introduction  and may cause customers to defer purchasing our existing products in anticipation of the new products 
this could harm our operating results by decreasing sales  increasing our inventory levels of older products and exposing us to greater risk of product obsolescence 
in addition  we have experienced  and may in the future experience  delays in developing and releasing new products and product enhancements 
this has led to  and may in the future lead to  delayed sales  increased expenses and lower quarterly revenue than anticipated 
during the development of our products  we have also experienced delays in the prototyping of our asics  which in turn has led to delays in product introductions 
some of our customers depend on the growth of the internet for all or substantially all of their revenue 
if the internet does not expand as expected  our business will be adversely affected 
a portion of our business and revenue depends on the use of the internet and on the deployment of our products by customers that depend on the growth of the internet 
spending on internet infrastructure has decreased significantly  which has had a material adverse effect on our business 
to the extent that the economic slowdown and reduction in capital spending continue to adversely affect spending on internet infrastructure or if the internet does not expand as a widespread communications medium and commercial marketplace  the growth of the market for internet infrastructure equipment may not continue and the demand for our products could be harmed 
hewlett packard is our most significant oem 
our business could be harmed if our relationship with hewlett packard is terminated 
hewlett packard hp  currently our most significant oem  accounted for of revenue for each of the years ended december  and if hp chooses to reduce or terminate its oem relationship with foundry  our revenue and ability to market and sell our products to certain prospective customers may be harmed 
the united states government is an increasingly important customer  but there is no guarantee of future contract awards 
as part of the changing economic environment  the united states government has become an increasingly important customer for the networking industry and foundry in particular 
the process of becoming a qualified government vendor takes considerable time and effort  and the timing of contract awards is hard to predict 
our failure to win any significant contract award may have a material adverse effect on our financial results as we increase our dependence on us government sales 
our gross margins may decline over time and the average selling prices of our products may decrease as a result of competitive pressures and other factors 
our industry has experienced erosion of average product selling prices due to a number of factors  particularly competitive and macroeconomic pressures and rapid technological change 
the average selling prices of our products has decreased in the past and may continue to decrease in response to competitive pressures  increased sales discounts  new product introductions by our competitors or other factors 
both we and our competitors sometimes lower sales prices in order to gain market share or create more demand 
furthermore  as a result of the recent disruption in the technology sector coupled with more broad macro economic factors  both we and our competitors may pursue more aggressive pricing strategies in an effort to maintain sales levels 
such intense pricing competition could cause our gross margins to decline and may adversely affect our business  operating results or financial condition 
our gross margins may be adversely affected if we are unable to reduce manufacturing costs and effectively manage our inventory levels 
although management continues to closely monitor inventory levels  declines in demand for our products could result in additional provision for inventory 
additionally  our gross margins may be negatively affected by fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  component costs  the mix of product configurations sold and the mix of distribution channels through which our products are sold 
for example  we generally realize higher gross margins on direct sales to the end user than on sales through resellers or our oems 
as a result  any significant shift in revenue through resellers or our oems could harm our gross margins 
if product or related warranty costs associated with our products are greater than we have experienced  our gross margins may also be adversely affected 
we need additional qualified personnel to maintain and expand our business 
if we are unable to promptly attract and retain qualified personnel  our business may be harmed 
we believe our future success will depend in large part upon our ability to identify  attract and retain highly skilled managerial  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel 
in spite of the economic downturn  competition for these personnel can be intense  especially in the san francisco bay area  and we may experience some difficulty hiring employees in the timeframe we desire  particularly engineers 
volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may also adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
in order to improve productivity  the company has historically used stock options to motivate and retain its employees 
some of the proposals currently under consideration by the accounting profession regarding the accounting treatment of stock options could limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool 
we may not succeed in identifying  attracting and retaining personnel 
the loss of the services of any of our key personnel  the inability to identify  attract or retain qualified personnel in the future or delays in hiring required personnel  particularly engineers and sales personnel  could make it difficult for us to manage our business and meet key objectives  such as timely product introductions 
our success also depends to a significant degree upon the continued contributions of our key management  engineering  sales and marketing  finance and manufacturing personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
in particular  we believe that our future success depends on bobby r 
johnson  jr  president  chief executive officer and chairman of the board 
we do not have employment contracts or key person life insurance covering any of our personnel 
our presence in international markets involve inherent risks that we may not be able to control 
as a result  our business may be harmed if we are unable to successfully address these risks 
our success will depend  in part  on increasing international sales and expanding our international operations 
our international sales primarily depend on our resellers  including pervasive networks and spot distribution ltd 
in europe  mitsui in japan  shanghai gentek and gti in china and samsung in korea 
the failure of our resellers to sell our products internationally would limit our ability to sustain and grow our revenue 
in particular  our revenue from japan depends primarily on mitsui s ability to sell our products and on the strength of the japanese economy  which has been weak in recent years 
there are a number of risks arising from our international business  including potential recessions in economies outside the united states  longer accounts receivable collection cycles  seasonal reductions in business activity  higher costs of doing business in foreign countries  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  difficulties associated with enforcing agreements through foreign legal systems  political instability and export restrictions  potential adverse tax consequences  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  military conflict and terrorist activities 
one or more of such factors may have a material adverse effect on our future international operations and  consequently  on our business  operating results and financial condition 
generally  international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive on a price basis in international markets 
in the future  we may elect to invoice some of our international customers in local currency  which could subject us to fluctuations in exchange rates between the us dollar and the local currency 
we purchase several key components for our products from several sources  if these components are not available  our revenues may be harmed 
we purchase several key components used in our products from several sources and depend on supply from these sources to meet our needs 
the inability of any supplier to provide us with adequate supplies of key components or the loss of any of our suppliers may cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders and may have a material adverse effect on our business and financial condition 
our principal limited sourced components include dynamic and static random access memories  commonly known as drams and srams  asics  printed circuit boards  optical components  microprocessors and power supplies 
we acquire these components through purchase orders and have no long term commitments regarding supply or price from these suppliers 
from time to time  we have experienced shortages in allocations of components  resulting in delays in filling orders 
we may encounter shortages and delays in obtaining components in the future which could impede our ability to meet customer orders 
we depend on anticipated product orders to determine our material requirements 
lead times for limited sourced materials and components can be as long as six months  vary significantly and depend on factors such as the specific supplier  contract terms and demand for a component at a given time 
inventory management remains an area of focus as we balance the need to maintain strategic inventory levels to ensure competitive lead times with the risk of inventory obsolescence due to rapidly changing technology and customer requirements 
if orders do not match forecasts or if we do not manage inventory effectively  we may have either excess or inadequate inventory of materials and components  which could negatively affect our operating results and financial condition 
our reliance on third party manufacturing vendors to manufacture our products may cause a delay in our ability to fill orders 
we subcontract substantially all of our manufacturing to companies that assemble and test our products 
our agreements with some of these companies allow them to procure long lead time component inventory on our behalf based upon a rolling production forecast provided by foundry with lead times of up to months 
foundry may be contractually obligated to the purchase of long lead time component inventory procured by our contract manufacturers in accordance with the forecast  unless foundry gives notice of order cancellation at least days prior to the delivery date 
if actual demand of our products is below the projections  we may have excess inventory as a result of our purchase commitments of long lead time components with our contract manufacturers 
we do not have long term contracts with these manufacturers 
we have experienced delays in product shipments from our contract manufacturers  which in turn delayed product shipments to our customers 
we may in the future experience similar delays or other problems  such as inferior quality and insufficient quantity of product  any of which could harm our business and operating results 
we intend to regularly introduce new products and product enhancements  which will require us to rapidly achieve volume production by coordinating our efforts with our suppliers and contract manufacturers 
we attempt to increase our material purchases  contract manufacturing capacity and internal test and quality functions to meet anticipated demand 
the inability of our contract manufacturers to provide us with adequate supplies of high quality products  the loss of any of our contract manufacturers  or the inability to obtain raw materials  could cause a delay in our ability to fulfill orders 
due to the lengthy sales cycles of some of our products  the timing of our revenue is difficult to predict and may cause us to miss our revenue expectations 
some of our products have a relatively high sales price  and often represent a significant and strategic decision by a customer 
the decision by customers to purchase our products is often based on their internal budgets and procedures involving rigorous evaluation  testing  implementation and acceptance of new technologies 
as a result  the length of our sales cycle in these situations can be as long as months and may vary substantially from customer to customer 
while our customers are evaluating our products and before they may place an order with us  we may incur substantial sales and marketing expenses and expend significant management effort 
consequently  if sales forecasted from a specific customer for a particular quarter are not realized in that quarter  we may not meet our revenue expectations 
the timing of the adoption of industry standards may negatively impact widespread market acceptance of our products 
our success depends in part on both the adoption of industry standards for new technologies in our market and our products compliance with industry standards 
many technological developments occur prior to the adoption of the related industry standard 
the absence of an industry standard related to a specific technology may prevent market acceptance of products using the technology 
we intend to develop products using new technological advancements  such as mpls draft martini  and may develop these products prior to the adoption of industry standards related to these technologies 
as a result  we may incur significant expenses and losses due to lack of customer demand  unusable purchased components for these products and the diversion of our engineers from future product development efforts 
further  we may develop products that do not comply with a later adopted industry standard  which could hurt our ability to sell these products 
if the industry evolves to new standards  we may not be able to successfully design and manufacture new products in a timely fashion that meet these new standards 
even after industry standards are adopted  the future success of our products depends upon widespread market acceptance of their underlying technologies 
at least one networking equipment standards body has reportedly stopped all work on a standard in response to assertions by nortel that it controls the patent rights to certain industry standards 
attempts by third parties to impose licensing fees on industry standards could undermine the adoption of such standards and lessen industry opportunities 
if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our business and ability to compete could suffer 
our success and ability to compete are substantially dependent upon our internally developed technology and know how 
our proprietary technology includes our asics  our ironcore and jetcore hardware architecture  our ironware software  and certain mechanical designs 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws and contractual restrictions on disclosure to protect our intellectual property rights in these proprietary technologies 
although we have patent applications pending  there can be no assurance that patents will be issued from pending applications  or that claims allowed on any future patents will be sufficiently broad to protect our technology 
we provide software to customers under license agreements included in the packaged software 
these agreements are not negotiated with or signed by the licensee  and thus may not be enforceable in some jurisdictions 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights through confidentiality and license agreements  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy or otherwise obtain and use our products or technology 
these precautions may not prevent misappropriation or infringement of our intellectual property 
monitoring unauthorized use of our products is difficult and the steps we have taken may not prevent misappropriation of our technology  particularly in some foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as in the united states 
we may be subject to intellectual property infringement claims that are costly to defend and could limit our ability to use certain technologies in the future 
the networking industry is increasingly characterized by the existence of a large number of patent claims and related litigation regarding patent and other intellectual property rights 
in particular  some companies in the networking industry claim extensive patent portfolios 
as a result of the existence of a large number of patents and rapid rate of issuance of new patents in the networking industry  it is not economically practical for a company of our size to determine in advance whether a product or any of its components may infringe patent rights claimed by others 
from time to time third parties have asserted exclusive patent  copyright and trademark rights to technologies and related standards that are important to us 
such third parties may assert claims or initiate litigation against us or our manufacturers  suppliers or customers alleging infringement of their proprietary rights with respect to our existing or future products 
in march  nortel filed a lawsuit against foundry in the united states district court for the district of massachusetts alleging that certain of the company s products infringe several of nortel s patents and seeking injunctive relief as well as unspecified damages 
nortel has also brought suit  on the same or similar patents  against a number of other networking companies 
foundry has analyzed the validity of nortel s claims and believes that nortel s suit is without merit 
foundry is committed to vigorously defending itself against these claims 
on october   the company filed a lawsuit against nortel in the united states district court  northern district of california alleging that certain of nortel s products infringe a foundry patent as well as allegations concerning breach of contract 
the company is seeking injunctive relief as well as damages 
irrespective of the merits of the company s position  we may incur substantial expenses in defending against third party claims 
in the event of a determination adverse to us  we could incur substantial monetary liability  and be required to change our business practices 
either of these could have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in difficult economic times  certain companies often attempt to realize revenues from their patent portfolios by establishing licensing programs 
some of these companies have contacted foundry regarding a license 
foundry carefully reviews any license requests  but is unwilling to license any technology it does not require for its product portfolio 
any asserted license demand can require considerable effort to review and respond 
moreover  a denial by us of a license request could result in threats of litigation or actual litigation  which  if initiated  could harm our business 
if our products contain undetected software or hardware errors  we could incur significant unexpected expenses and lost sales and be subject to product liability claims 
our products are complex and may contain undetected defects or errors  particularly when first introduced or as new enhancements and versions are released 
despite our testing procedures  these defects and errors may be found after commencement of commercial shipments 
any defects or errors in our products discovered in the future or failures of our customers networks  whether caused by our products or another vendors products could result in negative customer reactions  product liability claims  negative publicity regarding us and our products  delays in or loss of market acceptance of our products  product returns  lost sales  and unexpected expenses to remedy errors 
if we do not adequately manage our systems and processes  our business may be harmed 
our ability to successfully implement our business plan requires an effective planning and management process 
our current or planned personnel systems  procedures and controls may not be adequate to support our future operations 
we need to continue to improve existing and implement new operational and financial systems  procedures and controls 
any delay in the implementation of or disruption in the transition to new or enhanced systems  procedures or controls  could harm our ability to accurately forecast sales demand  manage our supply chain and record and report financial and management information on a timely and accurate basis 
our products may not meet the standards required for their sale  which may harm our business 
in the united states  our products must comply with various regulations and standards defined by the federal communications commission and underwriters laboratories 
internationally  products that we develop may be required to comply with standards established by telecommunications authorities in various countries as well as those of certain international bodies 
although we believe our products are currently in compliance with domestic and international standards and regulations in countries we currently sell to  there is no assurance that our existing and future product offerings will continue to comply with evolving standards and regulations 
if we fail to obtain timely domestic or foreign regulatory approvals or certification  we may not be able to sell our products where these standards or regulations apply  which may prevent us from sustaining our revenue or maintaining profitability 
we may engage in acquisitions that could result in the dilution of our stockholders  cause us to incur substantial expenses and harm our business if we cannot successfully integrate the acquired business  products  technologies or personnel 
although foundry focuses on internal product development and growth  we may learn of acquisition prospects that would complement our existing business or enhance our technological capabilities as part of our business strategy 
future acquisitions by us could result in large and immediate write offs  the incurrence of debt and contingent liabilities or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could negatively affect our results of operations 
furthermore  acquisitions involve numerous risks and uncertainties  including difficulties in the assimilation of products  operations  personnel and technologies of the acquired companies  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering geographic and business markets in which we have no or limited prior experience  and potential loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
although we do not currently have any agreements or plans with respect to any material acquisitions  we may make acquisitions of complementary businesses  products or technologies in the future 
we may not be able to successfully integrate any businesses  products  technologies or personnel that might be acquired in the future  and our failure to do so could harm our business 
we may need to raise capital  but the availability of additional financing is uncertain 
we believe that our existing working capital and cash from future operations will enable us to meet our working capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  if cash from future operations is insufficient  or if cash is used for acquisitions or other currently unanticipated uses  we could be required to raise substantial additional capital 
additional capital  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to obtain additional capital  we may be required to reduce the scope of our planned product development and marketing efforts  which could harm our business  financial condition and operating results 
to the extent that we raise additional capital through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of such securities could result in dilution to our existing stockholders and could cause our stock price to decline 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities would have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock 
the terms of debt securities could impose restrictions on our operations and could cause our stock price to decline 
we face litigation risks 
we are a party to lawsuits in the normal course of our business 
litigation in general  and intellectual property and securities litigation in particular  can be expensive  lengthy and disruptive to normal business operations 
moreover  the results of complex legal proceedings are difficult to predict 
we believe that we have defenses in the lawsuits pending against us as indicated in part i 
item legal proceedings  and we are vigorously contesting these allegations 
responding to the allegations has been  and probably will be  expensive and time consuming for us 
an unfavorable resolution of the lawsuits could adversely affect our business  results of operations  or financial condition 
our stock price has been volatile historically  which may make it more difficult to resell shares when needed at attractive prices 
the trading price of our common stock has been and may continue to be subject to wide fluctuations 
our stock price may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors  such as quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by us or our competitors  changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities analysts  the operating and stock price performance of other companies that investors may deem comparable  and news reports relating to trends in our markets 
in addition  the stock market in general  and technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the price of our stock  regardless of our operating performance 
additionally  volatility or lack of positive performance in our stock price may adversely affect our ability to retain key employees  all of whom have been granted stock options 
if we are required to record stock option grants as compensation expense on our income statement  our profitability may be reduced significantly 
there is an ongoing debate among regulators and companies regarding the expensing of stock options 
the current methodology for expensing such stock options is based on  among other things  the historical volatility of the underlying stock 
as noted above  our stock price has been historically volatile 
therefore  the adoption of an accounting standard requiring companies to expense stock options would negatively impact our profitability and may adversely impact our stock price 
such adoption could also limit our ability to continue to use stock options as an incentive and retention tool 
management beneficially owns approximately of our stock  their interests could conflict with yours  significant sales of stock held by them and foundry s employees could have a negative effect on foundry s stock price 
foundry s directors and executive officers beneficially own approximately of our outstanding common stock as of december  as a result of their ownership and positions  our directors and executive officers collectively are able to significantly influence all matters requiring stockholder approval  including the election of directors and approval of significant corporate transactions 
our employees who own foundry common stock are also collectively able to significantly influence such matters 
such concentration of ownership may have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of foundry 
in addition  sales of significant amounts of shares held by foundry s employees  directors and executive officers  or the prospect of these sales  could adversely affect the market price of foundry s common stock 
anti takeover provisions could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us 
our board of directors has the authority to issue up to  shares of preferred stock and to determine the price  rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions  including voting rights  of those shares without any further vote or action by the stockholders 
the rights of the holders of common stock may be subject to  and may be adversely affected by  the rights of the holders of any preferred stock that may be issued in the future 
the issuance of preferred stock may have the effect of delaying  deferring or preventing a change of control of foundry without further action by the stockholders and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of the holders of common stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
further  certain provisions of our charter documents  including provisions eliminating the ability of stockholders to take action by written consent and limiting the ability of stockholders to raise matters at a meeting of stockholders without giving advance notice  may have the effect of delaying or preventing changes in control or management of foundry  which could have an adverse effect on the market price of our stock 
in addition  our charter documents do not permit cumulative voting  which may make it more difficult for a third party to gain control of our board of directors 
our operations could be significantly hindered by the occurrence of a natural disaster  terrorist acts or other catastrophic event  or power shortages 
our operations are susceptible to outages due to fire  floods  power loss  power shortages  telecommunications failures  break ins and similar events 
in addition  our headquarters and contract manufacturers are located in northern california  an area susceptible to earthquakes 
in recent years  the western united states and california in particular has experienced episodes of diminished electrical power supply 
as a result of these episodes  our contractors facilities and certain of our operations or facilities may be subject to rolling blackouts or other unscheduled interruptions of electrical power 
as a result of this energy crisis  these contractors may be unable to manufacture sufficient quantities of our products or they may increase their service fees 
in addition  since silicon valley is an important industrial area for the united states  we may be subject to acts of terrorism  which could cause a material disruption in our operations 
the prospect of such unscheduled interruptions may continue for the foreseeable future and we are unable to predict either their occurrence  duration or cessation 
we do not have multiple site capacity for all of our services in the event of any such occurrence 
despite our implementation of network security measures  our servers are vulnerable to computer viruses  break ins  and similar disruptions from unauthorized tampering with our computer systems 
we may not carry sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for losses that may occur as a result of any of these events 
any such event could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results  and financial condition 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foundry s investments are made in accordance with an investment policy approved by the board of directors 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserve capital while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
we generally place our investments with high credit quality issuers and  by policy  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer or fund 
a hypothetical basis point decline or increase in short term interest rates would reduce or increase the annualized earnings on our million of cash equivalents and short term investments at december  by approximately million 
our investment portfolio as of december  includes only marketable securities with original maturities of less than one year and with secondary or resale markets to ensure portfolio liquidity 
we have no investments denominated in foreign country currencies and therefore are not subject to foreign currency risk on such investments 
due to the nature of our short term investments  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure 
therefore  no quantitative tabular disclosures are required 
currently  all of our sales and expenses are denominated in us dollars  with the exception of canada s operations denominated in canadian dollars  and  as a result  we have not experienced significant foreign exchange gains and losses to date 
we do not currently enter into forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
however  in the event our exposure to foreign currency risk increases  we may choose to hedge those exposures
