overview we are a leading developer of next generation tools for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and function 
understanding genetic variation and function is critical to the development of personalized medicine  a key goal of genomics and proteomics 
our tools provide information that could be used to improve drugs and therapies  customize diagnoses and treatment  and cure disease 
completion of the sequencing of the human genome will drive demand for tools that can assist researchers in processing the billions of tests necessary to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information 
this requires functional analysis of highly complex biological systems  involving a scale of experimentation not practical using currently available tools and technologies 
using our technologies  we have developed a comprehensive line of products that can address the scale of experimentation and the breadth of functional analysis required to achieve the goals of molecular medicine 
our patented beadarray technology uses fiber optics to achieve a level of array miniaturization that allows for a new scale of experimentation 
an array is a collection of miniaturized test sites arranged on a surface that permits many tests  or assays  to be performed in parallel 
by arranging our arrays in a pattern that matches the wells of industry standard containers called microtiter plates  we can simultaneously process many samples in parallel  achieving throughput significantly beyond the capability of any technology known to us 
we assemble our arrays using relatively inexpensive materials 
our proprietary manufacturing process allows us to easily adapt the arrays to a broad range of applications 
these characteristics allow us to create next generation arrays with a unique combination of high throughput  cost effectiveness and flexibility 
in addition  our complementary oligator technology permits parallel synthesis of the millions of different pieces of dna necessary to perform large scale genetic analysis on arrays 
we provide both products and services that utilize our proprietary technologies 
during  we launched our commercial snp genotyping services product line which combines our beadarray technology with an automated  laboratory information management system  or lims  controlled process to provide high throughput identification of the most common form of genetic variation  known as single nucleotide 
table of contents polymorphisms  or snps 
we also manufacture custom oligonucleotides for sale using our proprietary oligator technology 
in the third quarter of  we announced the launch of our production scale genotyping laboratory 
this system is built around our proprietary beadarray technology 
included in the system are sherlock scanning equipment  goldengate assay protocols  lims and analytical software  fluid handling robotics  and access to sentrix array matrices and reagent kits for analyzing genetic sequences 
our sentrix array matrix is a collection of individual arrays arranged in a pattern compatible with standard microtiter plates  our reagent kit uses goldengate assay protocols and comprises a set of chemicals used for performing specific genotyping analyses and our sherlock scanning instrument is a confocal laser scanner used to read our array matrices 
our genotyping system is based on the production laboratory that has been operational in our genotyping service product line 
when installed  the genotyping system will be able to routinely produce one million genotypes per day 
as of the end of february  we have signed agreements for the sale of two genotyping laboratories 
in the fourth quarter of  we were named the largest us participant in the million international hapmap project funded by the national institutes of health 
a haplotype map of the human genome will allow more rapid and efficient large scale genetic association studies aimed at discovering variants contributing to human disease and differential response to drug treatments 
we are one of five funded us participants in a worldwide initiative that includes research groups in canada  china  japan  nigeria and the united kingdom 
we will be directly responsible for mapping over of the haplotypes in the human genome 
this effort leverages our oligator dna synthesis capability and the production scale throughput of our genotyping services operation 
we were incorporated in california in april we reincorporated in delaware in july our principal executive offices are located at towne centre drive  san diego  california our telephone number is industry background genetic variation and function every person inherits two copies of each gene  one from each parent 
the two copies of each gene may be identical  or they may be different 
these differences are referred to as genetic variation 
examples of the physical consequences of genetic variation include differences in eye and hair color 
genetic variation can also have important medical consequences  including predisposition to disease and differential response to drugs 
genetic variation affects diseases  including cancer  diabetes  cardiovascular disease and alzheimer s disease 
in addition  genetic variation may cause people to respond differently to the same drug 
some people may respond well  others may not respond at all  and still others may experience adverse side effects 
the most common form of genetic variation is a single nucleotide polymorphism  or snp 
a snp is a variation in a single position in a dna sequence 
it is estimated that the human genome contains between three and six million snps 
while in some cases a single snp will be responsible for medically important effects  it is now believed that the genetic component of most major diseases is the result of the interaction of many snps 
therefore  it will be important to investigate many snps together in order to discover medically valuable information 
current efforts to understand genetic variation and function have centered around three principal techniques snp genotyping  gene expression profiling and proteomics 
snp genotyping snp genotyping is the process of determining which snps are present in each of the two copies of a gene  or other portion of dna sequence  within an individual or other organism 
the use of snp genotyping to obtain meaningful statistics on the effect of an individual snp or a collection of snps  and to apply that information to clinical trials and diagnostic testing  will require the analysis of millions of snp genotypes and the testing of large populations for each disease 
for example  a single large clinical trial could involve 
table of contents genotyping  snps per patient in  patients  thus requiring million assays 
using available technologies  this scale of snp genotyping is both impractical and prohibitively expensive 
large scale snp genotyping will be used for a variety of applications  including genomics based drug development  clinical trial analysis  disease predisposition testing  and disease diagnosis 
snp genotyping can also be used outside of healthcare  for example in the development of plants and animals with desirable commercial characteristics 
these markets will require billions of snp genotyping assays annually 
gene expression profiling gene expression profiling is the process of determining which genes are active in a specific cell or group of cells and is accomplished by measuring mrna  the intermediary between genes and proteins 
variation in gene expression can cause disease  or act as an important indicator of disease or predisposition to disease 
by comparing gene expression patterns between cells from different environments  such as normal tissue compared to diseased tissue or in the presence or absence of a drug  specific genes or groups of genes that play a role in these processes can be identified 
studies of this type  used in drug discovery  require monitoring thousands  and preferably tens of thousands  of mrnas in large numbers of samples 
once a smaller set of genes of interest has been identified  researchers can then examine how these genes are expressed or suppressed across numerous samples  for example  within a clinical trial 
the high cost of current gene expression methods has limited the development of the gene expression market 
once gene expression patterns have been correlated to specific diseases  gene expression profiling is expected to become an important diagnostic tool 
diagnostic use of expression profiling tools is anticipated to grow rapidly with the combination of the sequencing of various genomes and the availability of more cost effective technologies 
proteomics proteomics is the process of determining which proteins are present in cells and how they interact with one another 
proteomics is another method of correlating the molecular state of a cell with disease or reaction to a stimulus such as a drug 
this market remains undeveloped  as low cost  accurate technologies for analysis have not been available 
we expect that proteomics will become valuable in drug discovery research as the technologies improve and that array technology will be critical in facilitating the growth of this market 
our technologies beadarray technology we have developed a proprietary array technology that enables the large scale analysis of genetic variation and function 
our beadarray technology combines fiber optic bundles and microscopic beads in a simple proprietary manufacturing process to produce array matrices that can perform many assays simultaneously 
our beadarray technology provides a unique combination of high throughput  cost effectiveness  and flexibility 
we achieve high throughput with a high density of test sites per array and our ability to format arrays in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates 
we maximize cost effectiveness by reducing consumption of expensive reagents and valuable samples  and from the low manufacturing costs associated with our complementary technologies 
our ability to vary the size  shape and format of the fiber optic bundles and to create specific bead pools for different applications provides the flexibility to address multiple markets and market segments 
we believe that these features will enable our beadarray technology to become a leading platform for the emerging high growth markets of snp genotyping  gene expression profiling and proteomics 
our proprietary beadarray technology combines fiber optic bundles and specially prepared beads that self assemble into an array 
we have the fiber optic bundles manufactured to our specifications  which we cut into lengths of less than one inch 
each bundle contains approximately  individual fibers and of these bundles are placed into an aluminum housing  which forms an array matrix 
in a separate process  we create sensors by affixing a specific type of molecule to each of the billions of microscopic beads in a batch 
we make 
table of contents different batches of beads  with the beads in a given batch coated with one particular type of molecule 
the particular molecules on a bead define that bead s function as a sensor 
for example  we create a batch of snp sensors by attaching a particular dna sequence to each bead in the batch 
we combine batches of coated beads to form a pool specific to the type of array we intend to create 
a bead pool one milliliter in volume contains sufficient beads to produce thousands of arrays 
one of the advantages of this technology is that it allows us to create universal arrays for snp genotyping 
all of our snp genotyping arrays are manufactured with the same set of sensors 
this allows us to manufacture one type of array  and by varying the reagent kit  still be able to use it to test for any combination of snps 
to form an array we typically dip each fiber optic bundle into a pool of coated beads 
the coated beads are drawn into the wells  no more than one bead per well  on the end of each fiber in the bundle 
we call this process self assembly 
the tens of thousands of beads at the end of the fiber optic bundle comprise our beadarray 
because the beads assemble randomly into the wells  we perform a final procedure called decoding in order to determine which bead type occupies which well in the array 
we employ several proprietary methods for decoding  a process that requires only a few steps to identify all the beads in the array 
one beneficial by product of the decoding process is a validation of each bead in the array 
this quality control test characterizes the performance of each bead and can identify and eliminate use of any empty wells 
we ensure that each bead type on the array is sufficiently represented by having multiple copies of each bead type 
this improves the reliability and accuracy of the resulting data by allowing statistical processing of the results of identical beads 
one performs an experiment on the beadarray matrices by preparing a sample  such as dna from a patient  and introducing it to the array 
the design features of our beadarray matrix allow it to be simply dipped into a solution containing the sample 
the molecules in the sample bind to their matching molecules on the coated bead 
the sherlock scanning instrument detects the matched molecules by shining a laser through the fiber optic bundle 
since the molecules in the sample have a structure that causes them to emit light in response to a laser  detection of a binding event is possible 
this allows the measurement of the number of molecules bound to each coated bead  resulting in a quantitative analysis of the sample 
oligator technology genomic applications require many different short pieces of dna that can be made synthetically  called oligonucleotides 
for example  snp genotyping typically requires three to four different oligonucleotides per assay 
a snp genotyping experiment analyzing  snps may therefore require  to  different oligonucleotides  contributing significantly to the expense of the experiment 
we have designed our proprietary oligator technology for the parallel synthesis of many different oligonucleotides to meet the requirements of large scale genomics applications 
we believe that our oligator technology is substantially more cost effective and provides higher throughput than available commercial alternatives 
our technology allows for the automated parallel synthesis of oligonucleotides within each machine 
depending on the length of the oligonucleotide  each machine can synthesize approximately  to  oligonucleotides per day 
we believe we can expand this technology in the future and produce instruments with greater capacity which will produce oligonucleotides at a lower cost 
key advantages of our beadarray and oligator technologies we believe that our beadarray and oligator technologies provide distinct advantages  in a variety of applications  over competing technologies  by creating cost effective  highly miniaturized arrays with the following advantages high throughput 
the miniaturization of our beadarray matrix provides significantly greater information content per unit area than any other array known to us 
to further increase throughput  we have formatted our arrays in a pattern arranged to match the wells of standard microtiter plates  allowing throughput levels of up to million unique assays per microtiter plate 
the oligator s parallel synthesis capability allows us to manufacture the diversity of oligonucleotides necessary to support large scale genomic applications 

table of contents cost effectiveness 
our beadarray matrix substantially reduces the cost of experiments as a result of our proprietary manufacturing process and our ability to capitalize on cost reductions generated by advances in fiber optics  digital imaging and bead chemistry 
in addition  our miniaturized beadarray matrix requires smaller volumes than other array technologies  and therefore reduces reagent costs 
our oligator technology further reduces reagent costs  as well as the cost of coating beads 
flexibility 
a wide variety of conventional chemistries are available for attaching different molecules  such as dna  rna  proteins  and other chemicals to beads 
by using beads  we are able to take advantage of these chemistries to create a wide variety of sensors  which we assemble into arrays using the same proprietary manufacturing process 
in addition  we can have fiber optic bundles manufactured in multiple shapes and sizes and organized in various arrangements to optimize them for different markets and market segments 
in combination  the use of beads and fiber optic bundles provides the flexibility and scalability for our beadarray technology to be tailored to perform many applications in many different market segments  from drug discovery to diagnostics 
our oligator technology allows us to manufacture a wide diversity of lengths and quantities of oligonucleotides 
accuracy 
the high density of beads in each array enables us to have multiple copies of each individual bead type 
we measure the copies simultaneously and combine them into one data point 
this allows us to make a comparison of each bead against its own population of identical beads  which permits the statistical calculation of a more reliable and accurate value for each data point 
finally  the manufacture of the array includes a proprietary decoding step that also functions as a quality control test of every bead on every array  improving the overall accuracy of the data 
our strategy our goal is to make our beadarray platform the industry standard for products and services utilizing array technologies 
we plan to achieve this by focusing on emerging high growth markets  rapidly commercializing our production scale snp genotyping laboratory  expanding our technologies into multiple product lines and market segments  and strengthening our technological leadership 
products and services the first implementation of our beadarray technology  the sentrix array  is a disposable matrix with fiber optic bundles arranged in a pattern that matches the standard well microtiter plate 
each fiber optic bundle performs more than  unique assays 
therefore  one sentrix array can perform nearly  individual assays simultaneously  more than any other array system known to us 
we have provided genotyping services using our proprietary beadarray platform 
in addition  we have developed our first genotyping products based on our array of arrays technology 
these products include disposable sentrix array matrices  goldengate reagent kits for snp genotyping and sherlock scanning instruments 
snp genotyping during  we introduced the first commercial application of our beadarray technology by launching our snp genotyping services product line 
we signed our first services contract with glaxosmithkline in and we entered into service contracts during during the last month of the year  we completed over million genotypes  including several days in which we operated at two million genotypes per day 
to our knowledge  no other genotyping platform can achieve comparable levels of throughput while delivering such high accuracy and low cost 

table of contents we have designed our first consumable beadarray product  the sentrix array matrix  for snp genotyping 
the sentrix array matrix uses a universal format that allows it to analyze any set of snps 
we have also developed reagent kits based on goldengate assay protocols and a confocal laser scanner  sherlock  which is used to read our array matrices 
these three components  combined with lims  standard operating procedures and analytical software and fluid handling robotics comprise our snp genotyping system 
this system was commercialized in late and is based on the system that has been operational in our genotyping service product line for over a year 
when installed  the genotyping system will be able to routinely produce one million genotypes per day 
in january  we announced the availability of two assay sets  one for genetic linkage analysis and the other for fine chromosomal or whole genome mapping 
these standard products have been deployed in our genotyping services operation and are also available for customers who use our snp genotyping system 
genetic linkage analysis can help identify chromosomal regions with potential disease associations 
fine mapping provides dense genotyping and may enable target gene identification related to a specific disease 
gene expression profiling we will design our first product for gene expression profiling to test selected sets of approximately to  genes on large numbers of samples 
we believe that there is currently a need for a cost effective and high throughput gene expression profiling technology to analyze the activity of selected sets of genes from many samples simultaneously 
scanning instrumentation we have developed a confocal laser scanning instrument  sherlock  which is used to scan our sentrix array matrices and is part of our production scale snp genotyping laboratory 
this scanning equipment was designed to be used in all areas of genetic analysis that use our sentrix arrays 
high throughput synthesis we have put in place an oligonucleotide manufacturing facility that currently has the capability of producing approximately million oligonucleotides per year 
in addition to their use to coat beads  these oligonucleotides are components of the reagent kits for our beadarray products and are used for assay development 
because our production capacity exceeds our internal needs  we began to offer oligonucleotides for sale to high volume users in we provide oligonucleotides in a wide range of lengths and in several scales  with the ability to add many types of modifications 
we offer a range of quality control options and have implemented a laboratory information management system to control much of the manufacturing process 
in february  we introduced the first of a series of standard product offerings in our oligator product line  a whole genome oligonucleotide reference set designed and optimized for spotted gene expression microarrays 
we believe our proprietary oligator technology is more cost effective than competing technologies which has allowed us to market our oligonucleotides and oligonucleotide sets under a price leadership strategy 
partnerships and collaborations in november  we entered into a joint development agreement with applied biosystems  a division of applera corporation  under which the companies would jointly develop a snp genotyping system that would combine our beadarray tm technology with applied biosystems assay chemistry and scanner technology 
under this agreement  we were responsible for developing and manufacturing the arrays and applied biosystems was responsible for developing and manufacturing the instruments  snp assay reagents and software and for marketing the system worldwide 
in conjunction with the agreement  applied biosystems purchased million shares of series c convertible preferred stock at per share 
in addition  applied biosystems agreed to provide us with non refundable research and development support of million  all of which was provided by december upon commercialization of the system  we were to receive a share of the operating profits from the sales of all components of these systems  should such sales occur 

table of contents in july  applied biosystems indicated that the planned mid launch of this genotyping system would be delayed a second time 
this delay was related to applied biosystems inability to optimize and multiplex the snp assay reagents 
it is our current belief that applied biosystems has no intention of continuing to develop a collaboration product with us 
as a result of the delay in developing the collaboration product  we launched our own production scale genotyping system in july in december  we announced that we had notified applied biosystems that it was in breach of the joint development agreement 
this notification followed a patent infringement suit filed by applied biosystems against us and a notification from applied biosystems alleging that we had breached the joint development agreement and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to the agreement 
for further information regarding this matter  please see item  legal proceedings and item  managements discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we do not have any other significant partnerships or collaborations 
research and development we have made substantial investments in research and development since our inception 
we have assembled a team of skilled engineers and scientists who are specialists in biology  chemistry  informatics  instrumentation  optical systems  software  manufacturing and other related areas required to complete the development of our products 
our research and development efforts have focused primarily on the tasks required to optimize our beadarray and oligator technologies so that we can commercialize the initial products and services derived from these technologies 
these efforts include among others we made substantial improvements in the quality and manufacturing yield of our sentrix arrays 
we are exploring ways to increase the level of automation in the manufacturing process and to reduce the time and cost of producing arrays 
we currently have the infrastructure in place to manufacture array matrices in sufficient quantity to meet anticipated internal and external needs 
we introduced a number of initiatives in to improve the yield and quality of our oligonucleotides while reducing cost substantially 
by refining our understanding of the design and operation of our oligator technology  we have been able to make numerous changes in our process  which we believe provides us a more cost effective system than competing technologies 
during we more than tripled our production capacity to approximately million oligonucleotides per year 
we expect these efforts will result in further increases in capacity per machine and lower costs per oligonucleotide during we have developed the sherlock confocal laser scanning instrument that scans our sentrix array matrices for genetic analysis experiments 
confocal laser scanners provide the high sensitivity and resolution required to address the extremely dense geometries of our bead based arrays 
we expect to make the first commercial shipments of our scanners in the first quarter of we have been exploring the underlying molecular biology and chemistry issues related to developing assays and performing experiments on our beadarray platforms 
by improving our processes and protocols  we have substantially increased the number of snp assays we can process simultaneously in a single sample  as well as  on a single fiber 
we believe that our current multiplexing levels are the highest of any product on the market 
one of the key benefits of our beadarray technology is that it can be applied to other areas of genetic analysis and extended to applications outside the life science industry 
we continue to explore and optimize the processes required to perform gene expression and proteomics analysis on our arrays 
our research and development expenses for the fiscal years  and exclusive of charges relating to stock based compensation of million  million and million  respectively were million  million and million  respectively 
we expect research and development expense to increase in the future as we continue to expand our research and product development efforts

this license is retained by the us government as provided by applicable statutes and regulations 
we do not believe that the retained license will have any impact on our ability to market our products  and we do not need government approval with respect to this license in order to enter into collaborations or other relationships with third parties 
we have seven grants from the national institutes of health  including a million award in connection with our role in the human haplotyping effort 
intellectual property we have an extensive patent portfolio  including ownership of  or exclusive licenses to  issued us patents and pending us patent applications  including one allowed application that has not yet issued as a patent  some of which derive from a common parent application 
our issued patents  which cover various aspects of our beadarray  oligonucleotide synthesis and chemical detection technologies  expire between and we are seeking to extend this patent protection on our beadarray  goldengate  oligator  sentrix and related technologies 
we have received or filed counterparts for many of these patents and applications in one or more foreign countries 
we also rely upon trade secrets  know how  copyright and trademark protection  as well as continuing technological innovation and licensing opportunities to develop and maintain our competitive position 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patent protection for our products and processes  to preserve our copyrights and trade secrets  to operate without infringing the proprietary rights of third parties and to acquire licenses related to enabling technology or products used with our beadarray  goldengate  and oligator  sentrix and sherlock technologies 
we are party to various exclusive and non exclusive license agreements with third parties  which grant us rights to use key aspects of our array technology  assay methods  chemical detection methods  reagent kits and scanning equipment 
for example  we have an exclusive license from tufts university to patents filed by dr 
david walt  a member of our board of directors  the chairman of our scientific advisory board and one of our founders 
our exclusive licenses expire with the termination of the underlying patents  which will occur between and we also have non exclusive licenses related to confocal scanning instrumentation and our goldengate assay 
these licenses are critical to our business 
manufacturing we manufacture our array matrices  reagent kits  scanning equipment and oligonucleotides in house and believe that we currently have the ability to manufacture these in sufficient quantity to meet anticipated internal and external needs 
we currently depend upon outside suppliers for materials used in the manufacture of our products 
we intend to continue  and may extend  the outsourcing of portions of our manufacturing process to subcontractors where we determine it is in our best commercial interests 
during  we moved into a new facility which allowed us to design the manufacturing areas to fit our specific processes  and optimize material flow and personnel movement 
in addition  we have implemented custom laboratory information management systems for many of our manufacturing and services operations to manage all aspects of material and sample use 
we adhere to access and safety standards required by federal  state and local health ordinances  such as standards for the use  handling and disposal of hazardous substances 
competition although we expect that our beadarray products and services will provide significant advantages over currently available products and services  we expect to encounter intense competition from other companies that offer products and services for the snp genotyping  gene expression and proteomics markets 
these include companies such as aclara biosciences  affymetrix  agilent  amersham biosciences  applied 
table of contents biosystems  beckman coulter  caliper technologies  luminex  perlegen sciences  sequenom and third wave technologies 
many of these companies have or will have substantially greater financial  technical  research  and other resources and larger  more established marketing  sales  distribution and service organizations than we do 
in addition  they may have greater name recognition than we do in the markets we need to address 
each of these markets is very competitive and we expect new competitors to emerge and the intensity of competition to increase in the future 
in order to effectively compete with these companies  we will need to demonstrate that our products have superior throughput  cost and accuracy advantages over the existing products 
rapid technological development may result in our products or technologies becoming obsolete 
products offered by us could be made obsolete either by less expensive or more effective products based on similar or other technologies 
although we believe that our technology and products will offer advantages that will enable us to compete effectively with these companies  we cannot assure you that we will be successful

a notice of appeal in this case was filed on october   and the appeal process is ongoing 
we are also recording interest expense on the million during the appeal based on the statutory rate 
in december  applied biosystems group filed a patent infringement suit against illumina in the federal district court in northern california asserting infringement of several patents related to an applied biosystems assay intended for use in our collaboration 
to date  applied biosystems has not yet served us with this patent infringement complaint 
in that complaint  applied biosystems is seeking a judgment granting it damages for infringement  treble damages alleging that such infringement is willful and a permanent injunction restraining us from the alleged infringement 
also in december  applied biosystems sent a notification to us alleging that we had breached the joint development agreement between illumina and applied biosystems entered into in november and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to that agreement 
this notification alleges that our production scale genotyping system and our consumables are collaboration products developed under the joint development agreement  that these products are being sold within the collaboration field described in that agreement  and that our commercial activities with respect to our genotyping system are unlawful  unfair or fraudulent 
among other relief it sought via an arbitration proceeding  applied biosystems sought compensatory damages of million  disgorgement of all revenues received from sales of our genotyping system or through our genotyping services product line and a prohibition of future sales of these products or services 
we responded in a letter notification dated december  to applied biosystems that applied biosystems was in breach of the joint development agreement  having twice delayed the launch of our collaborative product  and despite our continual compliance with our obligations under this agreement  and further disputing that the arbitration proceeding was appropriate 
on december   we filed a suit alleging breach of contract  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  unfair competition and other allegations against applied biosystems in san diego superior court  and a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent the arbitration of our joint development agreement sought by applied biosystems 
the court granted our temporary restraining order on december  we then moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the arbitration from proceeding until a trial in the superior court case  while applied biosystems brought a motion seeking to dismiss this superior court action and to compel arbitration between the parties 
in february  we amended our complaint to additionally allege that we had been fraudulently induced by applied biosystems into entering into an agreement to arbitrate certain disputes by misrepresenting the purpose and intended effect of the arbitration provision of the joint development agreement 
on february   the san diego superior court granted our motion for preliminary injunction to prevent the arbitration process and denied applied 
table of contents biosystem s motion to compel arbitration without prejudice 
applied biosystems subsequently moved to demur to the claim of fraudulent inducement  and that motion in now pending 
no trial date has been set for this case 
we believe the claims alleged by applied biosystems are without merit in both the patent infringement case and their enjoined demand for arbitration  and that we have a strong case regarding our breach of contract and other related allegations against applied biosystems 
however  we cannot be sure that we will prevail in these matters 
if we are unable to successfully defend against these allegations  it could result in a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we are not currently a party to any other material legal proceedings 
from time to time  we may be involved in litigation relating to claims arising out of our operations in the usual course of business

our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in factors affecting operating results below as well as those discussed elsewhere 
overview illumina  inc was incorporated in april we are developing next generation tools for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and function 
the information provided by these analyses will help enable the development of personalized medicine  a key goal of genomics and proteomics 
our proprietary beadarray technology will provide the throughput  cost effectiveness and flexibility necessary to enable researchers in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries to perform the billions of tests necessary to extract medically valuable information from advances in genomics 
this information will correlate genetic variation and gene function with particular disease states  enhancing drug discovery  allowing diseases to be detected earlier and more specifically  and permitting better choices of drugs for individual patients 
our technology may also have applicability across a wide variety of industries beyond life sciences and pharmaceuticals  including agriculture  food  chemicals and petrochemicals 
however  we do not currently expect that these markets will have the revenue potential of the life sciences market 
in the first quarter of  we began commercial sale of custom oligonucleotides manufactured using our proprietary oligator technology 
as a result of our favorable manufacturing cost structure  we have been able to implement a price leadership strategy in the plate based segment of this market and have steadily been able to grow our market share 
in the second quarter of  we initiated our snp genotyping services product line and we have entered into service contracts in as a result of the increasing market acceptance of our high throughput  low cost beadarray technology  we have entered into significant contracts with many of the leading genotyping organizations including glaxosmithkline  and the sanger centre  and have recently received a million award from the national institutes of health to play a major role in the human haplotyping effort 
in november  we entered into a joint development agreement with applied biosystems under which the companies would jointly develop a snp genotyping system that would combine our beadarray technology with applied biosystems assay chemistry and scanner technology 
under this agreement  we were responsible for developing and manufacturing the arrays and applied biosystems was responsible for developing and manufacturing the instruments  snp assay reagents  and software and for marketing the system worldwide 
in conjunction with the agreement  applied biosystems purchased million shares of series c convertible preferred stock at per share 
in addition  applied biosystems agreed to provide us with non refundable research and development support of million  all of which was provided by december upon 
table of contents commercialization of the system  we would receive a share of the operating profits from the sales of all components of these systems 
we have deferred recognition of revenue from the research funding of million provided by applied biosystems  and would recognize such amounts as revenue at the rate of of the total profit share we earn from the sales of collaborative products  should such sales occur 
in july  applied biosystems indicated that the planned mid launch of this genotyping system would be delayed a second time 
this delay was related to applied biosystems inability to optimize and multiplex the snp assay reagents 
it is our current belief that applied biosystems has no intention of continuing to develop a collaboration product with us 
as a result of the delay in developing the collaboration product  we launched our own production scale genotyping system in july in december  applied biosystems filed a patent infringement suit against us in the federal district court in northern california asserting infringement of several patents related to applied biosystems patented assay 
to date  applied biosystems has not served us with the complaint filed in this suit 
applied biosystems is seeking a judgment granting it damages for infringement  treble damages alleging that such infringement is willful and a permanent injunction restraining us from the alleged infringement 
also in december  applied biosystems sent a notification to us alleging that we had breached the joint development agreement entered into in november and seeking to compel arbitration pursuant to that agreement 
this notification alleges that our production scale genotyping system and our consumables are collaboration products developed under the joint development agreement  that these products are being sold within the collaboration field described in that agreement  and that our commercial activities with respect to its genotyping system are unlawful  unfair or fraudulent 
among other items  applied biosystems is seeking compensatory damages of million  disgorgement of all revenues received from sales of our genotyping system or through our genotyping services product line and a prohibition of future sales of these products or services 
in december  we filed a suit alleging breach of contract  breach of the implied covenant of good faith and fair dealing  unfair competition and other allegations against applied biosystems in san diego superior court  and a motion for a temporary restraining order to prevent the arbitration of our joint development agreement sought by applied biosystems 
the court granted the temporary restraining order 
we then moved for a preliminary injunction to prevent the arbitration from proceeding  while applied biosystems brought a motion seeking to compel arbitration between the parties 
in february  we amended our complaint to additionally allege that we had been fraudulently induced by applied biosystems into entering into an agreement to arbitrate certain disputes by misrepresenting the purpose and intended effect of the arbitration provision of the joint development agreement 
on february   the san diego superior court granted our motion for preliminary injunction and denied applied biosystem s motion to compel arbitration without prejudice 
no trial date has been set for this case 
we will continue to treat the million funding from applied biosystems as deferred revenue until the status of the collaboration agreement has been resolved 
we are in the early stages of proceedings to resolve the status of the collaboration agreement and the legal actions brought by both parties 
we believe the claims alleged by applied biosystems are without merit in both the patent infringement case and their enjoined demand for arbitration and that we have a strong case regarding our allegations against applied biosystems 
however  we cannot be sure that we will prevail in these matters 
if we are unable to successfully defend against these allegations  it could result in a material adverse affect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our production scale genotyping system is based on the system developed by the company that has been operational in our genotyping service product line since in addition to our arrays  it includes the sherlock proprietary confocal laser scanner  as well as the highly multiplexed goldengate snp genotyping assay 
we do not believe that any of these product components are covered by intellectual property held by applied biosystems or are otherwise within the scope of the collaboration agreement with applied biosystems 
consequently  we would retain all the operating profits  if any  generated through the sales of systems and consumables rather than share profits under the collaboration agreement 
this system is initially being marketed to a small number of high throughput genotyping users  however  over time  we will need to develop lower throughput versions of the system  as well as additional genetic analysis applications  which will be marketed more broadly and require substantial increases in our sales and marketing expenses 

table of contents as a result of the launch of our snp genotyping services and custom oligonucleotide product lines  we generated commercial product and service revenue of approximately million during fiscal  and approximately million during fiscal year in  we announced agreements for the sale of our first two high throughput snp genotyping systems 
we are seeking to expand our customer base for these products and services 
however  we have no assurance that our sales efforts will be successful in developing a market for systems such as this 
we have incurred substantial operating losses since our inception 
as of december   our accumulated deficit was million  and total stockholders equity was million 
these losses have principally occurred as a result of the substantial resources required for the research  development and manufacturing scale up effort required to commercialize our products and services  as well as charges of million related to a termination of employment lawsuit 
we expect to continue to incur substantial and increasing costs for research  development and manufacturing scale up activities over the next several years 
we will also need to significantly increase our selling  general and administrative costs as we begin to build up our sales and marketing infrastructure to expand and support the sale of systems  other products and services 
as a result  we will need to increase revenue significantly to achieve profitability 
results of operations comparison of years ended december  and december  revenue revenue for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
product revenue increased to million in from million in  mostly due to higher sales of oligonucleotides 
we have continued to grow sales and market share as a result of our product quality and price leadership strategy in the plate based oligonucleotide market segment 
snp genotyping service revenue was million in compared to million in as a result of the contracts that were signed during government grants and other research funding accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
we expect grant revenue to generally decline as a proportion of total revenue over the next few years as product and service revenue become a more important part of our business 
cost of product and service revenue cost of product and service revenue for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
the increase was driven by increased sales of products and services 
gross margins on product and service revenues were in  versus in  driven by a more favorable cost structure in oligo manufacturing 
costs related to research revenue is included in research and development expense 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and other personnel related expenses  facility costs and laboratory and manufacturing supplies 
total research and development expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses was driven primarily by higher headcount  related personnel costs and higher laboratory and manufacturing supplies required to continue development of our beadarray technology  which is the underlying technology on which illumina was founded 
during the year ended december   the research expense to support our beadarray activities increased million over the same period in these additional research and development expenses were related to activities such as exploring and optimizing assays for various types of genetic analysis experiments  increasing the multiplexing level of our arrays  continuing development of our arrays and the scanning instrumentation required to read arrays and building up and optimizing our snp genotyping services system 
research to support our oligator technology platform increased million during the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  during  we introduced upgrades to our oligator 
table of contents technology that significantly increased capacity and quality while reducing manufacturing cost  allowing us to adopt a price leadership strategy in the markets we serve 
we expect that our research and development expenses  including facilities related costs  will increase moderately over the next months as we transition several products from development to commercialization and then increase more substantially in future years to support research and technology development for new products 
general and administrative expenses our selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of personnel costs for sales and marketing  finance  human resources  business development and general management  as well as professional fees  such as expenses for legal and accounting services 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  a portion of this increase is due to higher legal expenses related to a termination of employment lawsuit and the legal proceedings regarding applied biosystems  as well as higher expenses related to securing patents 
the remaining increase was due to increases in the sales and marketing costs required to expand and support our custom oligonucleotide sales and snp genotyping services operations 
during the third and fourth quarters of we began our sales and marketing expansion into europe and in early  we began our expansion into japan 
we expect that our selling  general and administrative expenses will accelerate as we expand our staff  add sales and marketing infrastructure and incur additional costs to support our growth 
in addition  as a result of our decision to launch our own genotyping system  we expect that our selling and marketing expenses will increase at a faster rate than earlier anticipated since we will now be solely responsible for the marketing and support of this system 
amortization of deferred compensation and other non cash compensation charges from our inception through july   in connection with the grant of certain stock options and sales of restricted stock to employees  founders and directors  we have recorded deferred stock compensation totaling million  representing the difference between the exercise or purchase price and the fair value of our common stock as estimated for financial reporting purposes on the date such stock options were granted or such restricted stock was sold 
we recorded this amount as a component of stockholders equity and amortize the amount as a charge to operations over the vesting period of the restricted stock and options 
we recognize compensation expense over the vesting period for employees  founders and directors  using an accelerated amortization methodology in accordance with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
for consultants  deferred compensation is recorded at the fair value for the options granted or stock sold in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
and is periodically re measured and expensed in accordance with emerging issues task force no 
we recorded amortization of deferred compensation of million and million for the year ended december  and december   respectively 
subsequent to july   no deferred compensation has been recorded as all options have been granted at fair market value 
litigation judgment a million charge was recorded in june to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a termination of employment lawsuit 
we believe that the termination was lawful in all respects and that the verdict was unsupported by evidence presented at the trial 
we plan to vigorously defend our position on appeal 
a notice of appeal in this case was filed on october   and the appeal process is ongoing 
during the appeal process  the court requires us to incur interest charges on the judgment amount at statutory rates until the case is resolved 
in the year ended december   we recorded  for interest 
interest income interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
interest income decreased in due to lower average levels of invested funds and lower effective interest rates 

table of contents interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  resulted primarily from a million loan related to the purchase of our new facility during the first quarter of provision for income taxes we incurred net operating losses for the years ended december  and december   and accordingly  we did not pay any federal or state income taxes 
we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of the resulting net deferred tax asset  as the future realization of the tax benefit is uncertain 
as of december   we had net operating loss carryforwards for federal and state tax purposes of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in and we also had federal and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively  which begin to expire in  unless previously utilized 
our utilization of the net operating losses and credits may be subject to substantial annual limitations pursuant to section and of the internal revenue code  and similar state provisions  as a result of changes in our ownership structure 
these annual limitations may result in the expiration of net operating losses and credits prior to utilization 
comparison of years ended december  and december  revenue revenue for the years ended december  and december  was million and million  respectively 
government grants and other research funding accounted for approximately and of our total revenue for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
in  we began sales of custom oligonucleotides and most of the product revenue for this year was derived from those sales 
cost of product and service revenue cost of product and service revenue for the year ended december   which was the first year we commenced such revenue  was million 
there was no cost of product and service revenue for the year ended december  research and development research and development expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this increase was due primarily to increased staffing and other personnel costs to support the continued research and scale up of our beadarray and oligator technologies 
during  our research activities to support these technologies increased million and million  respectively 
the remaining million of expense increase was related to manufacturing process improvement activities mostly related to automating various parts of the manufacturing process to improve yields  cost  quality and processing time 
general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  a portion of this increase was due to increases in the sales and marketing costs required to launch and support our custom oligonucleotide sales and snp genotyping services operations 
the remaining increase was due to personnel and other costs associated with our transition to a public company and to support our growth as well as higher legal costs 

table of contents amortization of deferred compensation and other non cash compensation charges in connection with the grant of stock options and sale of restricted common stock to employees  founders and directors through july   we recorded deferred compensation of approximately million 
we recorded amortization of this deferred compensation of million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
we recorded an additional million of expense related to restricted common stock sold to consultants  which was expensed as our rights to repurchase the common stock lapsed and an additional million charge for the acceleration of vesting of restricted stock during the year ended december  in february  we modified all our consultant agreements to include assurances that the contracts would be fulfilled 
in accordance with these modifications  we recorded additional deferred compensation of million as a component of stockholders equity and amortize this amount as a charge to operations ratably over the vesting periods of the restricted stock and options 
we recorded amortization of this deferred compensation of approximately million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
interest income interest income on our cash and cash equivalents and investments was million and million for the years ended december  and december   respectively 
interest income increased in due to higher average levels of invested funds partially offset by lower effective interest rates 
interest expense interest expense was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense for the year ended december  resulted primarily from a construction loan related to our new facility and from a loan arrangement for purchases of capital equipment 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and investments including restricted cash and investments of million of approximately million 
we currently invest our funds in us dollar based investment grade corporate and government debt securities with average maturities of approximately months 
our operating activities used cash of million in the year ended december   as compared to million in the year ended december  the increase in cash used for operating activities was due primarily to an increase in our net loss for net of the non cash litigation judgment  amortization of non cash charges and depreciation expense  and the receipt of million in research funding in  which was recorded as deferred revenue 
our investing activities used cash of million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  the decline in cash used in investing activities was due primarily to the reinvestment of our investment portfolio from cash equivalents to investment securities in this was partially offset by an million increase in capital spending in that primarily relates to the purchase of a new facility 
our financing activities provided cash of million in the year ended december  as compared to million in the year ended december  cash provided by financing activities in resulted primarily from million in loan proceeds related to the purchase of our new facility 
in october  we entered into a million capital equipment lease financing arrangement with a lease financing corporation 
as of december   we had utilized all funds available under this lease agreement 
in april  we entered into a million loan arrangement to be used at our discretion to finance purchases of capital equipment  million of which remains available at december  
table of contents in july  we entered into a year lease to rent space in two newly constructed buildings that we now occupy 
that lease contained an option to purchase the buildings together with eight acres of adjacent land that has been approved for construction of an additional building 
at the time the lease was executed  we provided the developer with a million letter of credit that was increased to million in the third quarter of  and which was secured by restricted cash 
in addition  we provided the developer million of funding in the form of an interest bearing  secured loan with a term of approximately one year and a million deposit 
in december  we paid million to execute the option to purchase the buildings and related land 
during the third quarter of  the term of the secured loan expired and the principal and accrued interest thereon was applied to the purchase price for the project 
the purchase closed in january  at which time  the letter of credit was cancelled and we assumed a million  year mortgage on the property at a fixed interest rate of which calls for principal and interest payments of approximately million per year until the loan expires in january at which time a balloon payment of million will be due 
in june  we recorded a million charge to cover total damages and estimated expenses related to a termination of employment lawsuit 
as a result of the company s decision to appeal the ruling  we filed a surety bond with the court on october  of times the judgment amount  or approximately million 
under the terms of the bond  we are required to maintain a letter of credit for of the bond amount to secure the bond 
further  the company was required to deposit approximately million of marketable securities as collateral for the letter of credit and accordingly  these funds will be restricted from use for corporate purposes until the appeal process is completed  which we expect will occur within to months 
at december   the total of annual future minimum lease payments was million under capital lease arrangements that span two years 
total future minimum principal and interest payments under the mortgage we assumed in january are million  representing payments of approximately million per year for nine years with a balloon payment of million due at the end of the year term 
we expect that our current cash and cash equivalents  investments and funding from existing strategic alliances and grants will be sufficient to fund our anticipated operating needs for at least to months 
however  our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds will depend on many factors  including scientific progress in our research and development programs  the magnitude of those programs  competing technological and market developments  our ability to successfully commercialize our snp genotyping laboratory and extensions to that product and to expand our oligonucleotide and snp genotyping services product lines  the successful resolution of our legal proceedings with applied biosystems and the successful resolution of our appeal in a termination of employment lawsuit 
therefore  we may require additional funding within this time frame and the additional funding  if needed  may not be available on terms that are acceptable to us  or at all 
further  any additional equity financing may be dilutive to our then existing stockholders and may adversely affect their rights 
critical accounting policies since our inception  our activities have primarily consisted of research and development efforts related to developing our beadarray and oligator technologies 
accordingly  the large majority of our transactions to date have related to research and development spending 
we expense all such expenditures in the period incurred 
bulk quantities of laboratory supplies and manufacturing raw materials are inventoried when acquired but expensed when placed in use for research activities 
in  we launched our commercial snp genotyping services product line and began to offer oligonucleotides for sale 
revenue for oligonucleotide sales is recognized generally upon shipment and transfer of title to the customer 
revenue for genotyping services is recognized generally at the time the genotyping analysis data is delivered to the customer 
research revenue consists of amounts earned under research agreements with collaborators and government grants  which is recognized in the period during which the related costs are incurred 

table of contents we have one significant collaborative agreement  under which we received non refundable research funding support of million from applied biosystems through the end of all amounts received under that agreement were recorded as deferred revenue in accordance with staff accounting bulletin sab we will continue to reflect these payments as deferred revenue until the legal status of our collaborative agreement has been resolved 
we invest our excess cash balances in marketable debt securities  primarily government securities and corporate bonds and notes  with strong credit ratings 
we classify our investments as available for sale under sfas and record such investments at the estimated fair value in the balance sheet  with gains and losses  if any  reported in stockholders equity 
we periodically review our investments for other than temporary impairment 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between sfas and issue relates to the requirements under sfas for recognition of a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost as generally defined in issue was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan 
the provisions of sfas are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december   with early application encouraged 
we do not expect the adoption of sfas to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  we have currently chosen to not adopt the voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
if we should choose to adopt such a method  its implementation pursuant to sfas no 
could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
factors affecting our operating results in addition to the items mentioned above  the following issues could adversely affect our operating results or our stock price 
we have generated only a small amount of revenue from product and service offerings to date 
we expect to continue to incur net losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability 
we have incurred net losses since our inception and expect to continue to incur net losses 
at december   our accumulated deficit was approximately million  and we incurred a net loss of million for the fiscal year ended december  we expect to continue to incur net losses and negative cash flow for the foreseeable future 
the magnitude of our net losses will depend  in part  on the rate of growth  if any  of our revenue and on the level of our expenses 
we expect to incur significant expenses for research and development  for developing our manufacturing capabilities and for sales and marketing efforts to commercialize our products 
in addition  we expect to incur greater selling and marketing expenses in the 
table of contents future as a result of the launch our snp genotyping system 
as a result  we expect that our operating expenses will increase significantly as we grow and  consequently  we will need to generate significant additional revenue to achieve profitability 
even if we achieve profitability  we may not be able to sustain or increase profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
our success depends upon the increasing availability of genetic information and the continued emergence and growth of markets for analysis of genetic variation and function 
we design our products primarily for applications in the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries 
the usefulness of our technology depends in part upon the availability of genetic data and its usefulness in identifying or treating disease 
we are initially focusing on markets for analysis of genetic variation and function  namely snp genotyping  gene expression profiling and proteomics 
these markets are new and emerging  and they may not develop as we anticipate  or reach their full potential 
other methods of analysis of genetic variation and function may emerge and displace the methods we are developing 
also  researchers may not seek or be able to convert raw genetic data into medically valuable information through the analysis of genetic variation and function 
if useful genetic data is not available or if our target markets do not emerge in a timely manner  demand for our products will not develop as we expect  and we may never become profitable 
we are an early stage company with no commercial sales of microarray or scanning instrument products  and our success depends on our ability to develop commercially successful products and on market acceptance of our new and unproven technology 
we may not possess all of the resources  capability and intellectual property necessary to develop and commercialize all the products or services that may result from our technologies 
we currently do not sell our microarray or scanning instrument products although we expect to have such sales in early our technologies are in the early stages of commercialization or are still in development 
you should evaluate us in light of the uncertainties and complexities affecting an early stage company developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries 
we must conduct a substantial amount of additional research and development before some of our products will be ready for sale 
in addition  we are only at the early phase of offering custom oligonucleotides and snp genotyping services 
problems frequently encountered in connection with the development or early commercialization of products and services using new and unproven technologies might limit our ability to develop and successfully commercialize these products and services 
in addition  we may need to enter into agreements to obtain intellectual property necessary to commercialize some of our products or services 
historically  life sciences and pharmaceutical companies have analyzed genetic variation and function using a variety of technologies 
compared to the existing technologies  our technologies are new and unproven 
in order to be successful  our products must meet the commercial requirements of the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries as tools for the large scale analysis of genetic variation and function 
market acceptance will depend on many factors  including our ability to demonstrate to potential customers the benefits and cost effectiveness of our products and services relative to others available in the market  the extent of our efforts to market  sell and distribute our products  our ability to manufacture products in sufficient quantities with acceptable quality and reliability and at an acceptable cost  and the willingness and ability of customers to adopt new technologies requiring capital investments 

table of contents we have limited experience in manufacturing commercial products and services 
if we are unable to develop our manufacturing capability or find third party manufacturers to manufacture our products  we may not be able to launch or support our products in a timely manner  or at all 
we have limited experience manufacturing our products in the volumes that will be necessary for us to achieve significant commercial sales 
to date  our manufacturing activities for arrays have been limited to supplying pre commercial products for internal use and to support our snp genotyping services product line 
we have only recently begun manufacturing oligonucleotides for commercial sale and operating our internal snp genotyping service product line 
we are still in the process of optimizing our commercial manufacturing process for the scanning instrument that will be part of our snp genotyping system 
we currently possess only one facility capable of manufacturing our products and services for both sale to our customers and internal use 
if a natural disaster were to significantly damage our facility or if other events were to cause our operations to fail  these events could prevent us from developing and manufacturing our products and services 
the nature of our products requires customized components that currently are available from a limited number of sources 
for example  we currently obtain the fiber optic bundles included in our products from a single source 
if we are unable to secure a sufficient supply of fiber optic bundles or other product components  we will be unable to meet demand for our products 
we will need to enter into contractual relationships with manufacturers for commercial scale production of our products  or develop these capabilities internally  and we cannot assure you that we will be able to do this on a timely basis  for sufficient quantities or on commercially reasonable terms 
accordingly  we may not be able to establish or maintain reliable  high volume manufacturing at commercially reasonable costs 
our current sales  marketing and technical support organization may limit our ability to sell our products 
we currently have limited sales and marketing and technical support services and have only recently established a small direct sales force 
in order to effectively commercialize our genotyping system and other products to follow  we will need to expand our sales  marketing and technical support staff both domestically and internationally 
we may not be successful in establishing or maintaining either a direct sales force or distribution arrangements to market our products and services 
in addition  the efforts from a limited sales and marketing force may not be sufficient to build the market acceptance required to support continued growth of our business 
we may encounter difficulties in managing our growth 
these difficulties could increase our losses 
we expect to experience rapid and substantial growth in order to achieve our operating plans  which will place a strain on our human and capital resources 
if we are unable to manage this growth effectively  our losses could increase 
our ability to manage our operations and growth effectively requires us to continue to expend funds to enhance our operational  financial and management controls  reporting systems and procedures and to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees 
if we are unable to scale up and implement improvements to our manufacturing process and control systems in an efficient or timely manner  or if we encounter deficiencies in existing systems and controls  then we will not be able to make available the products required to successfully commercialize our technology 
failure to attract and retain sufficient numbers of talented employees will further strain our human resources and could impede our growth 
any inability to adequately protect our proprietary technologies could harm our competitive position 
our success will depend in part on our ability to obtain patents and maintain adequate protection of our intellectual property in the united states and other countries 
if we do not protect our intellectual property adequately  competitors may be able to use our technologies and thereby erode our competitive advantage 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the united states  and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights abroad 
these problems can be caused by the absence of rules and methods for defending intellectual property rights 

table of contents the patent positions of companies developing tools for the life sciences and pharmaceutical industries  including our patent position  generally are uncertain and involve complex legal and factual questions 
we will be able to protect our proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that our proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained as trade secrets 
we will apply for patents covering our technologies and products  as we deem appropriate 
however  our applications may be challenged and may not result in issued patents 
our existing patents and any future patents we obtain may not be sufficiently broad to prevent others from practicing our technologies or from developing competing products 
there also is risk that others may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or design around our patented technologies 
in december  applied biosystems filed  but has not yet served us with  a complaint alleging patent infringement against us asserting that our goldengate assay infringes several patents related to an applied biosystems assay method 
others may challenge or invalidate our patents or claim that we infringe the rights of third party patents 
also  our patents may fail to provide us with any competitive advantage 
we may need to initiate additional lawsuits to protect or enforce our patents  or litigate against third party claims  which would be expensive and  if we lose  may cause us to lose some of our intellectual property rights and reduce our ability to compete in the marketplace 
we also rely upon trade secret protection for our confidential and proprietary information 
we have taken security measures to protect our proprietary information 
these measures  however  may not provide adequate protection for our trade secrets or other proprietary information 
we seek to protect our proprietary information by entering into confidentiality agreements with employees  collaborators and consultants 
nevertheless  employees  collaborators or consultants may still disclose our proprietary information  and we may not be able to meaningfully protect our trade secrets 
in addition  others may independently develop substantially equivalent proprietary information or techniques or otherwise gain access to our trade secrets 
litigation or other proceedings or third party claims of intellectual property infringement could require us to spend time and money and could shut down some of our operations 
our commercial success depends in part on our non infringement of the patents or proprietary rights of third parties and the ability to protect our own intellectual property 
applied biosystems filed  but has not yet served us with  a patent infringement suit against us and other third parties may assert that we are employing their proprietary technology without authorization 
in addition  third parties may obtain patents in the future and claim that use of our technologies infringes these patents 
we could incur substantial costs and divert the attention of our management and technical personnel in defending ourselves against any of these claims 
we may incur the same costs and diversions in enforcing our patents against others 
furthermore  parties making claims against us may be able to obtain injunctive or other relief  which effectively could block our ability to further develop  commercialize and sell products  and could result in the award of substantial damages against us 
in the event of a successful claim of infringement against us  we may be required to pay damages and obtain one or more licenses from third parties 
we may not be able to obtain these licenses at a reasonable cost  or at all 
in that event  we could encounter delays in product introductions while we attempt to develop alternative methods or products 
defense of any lawsuit or failure to obtain any of these licenses could prevent us from commercializing available products 
we expect intense competition in our target markets  which could render our products obsolete or substantially limit the volume of products that we sell 
this would limit our ability to compete and achieve profitability 
if we cannot continuously develop and commercialize new products  our revenues may not grow as intended 
we compete with life sciences companies that design  manufacture and market instruments for analysis of genetic variation and function and other applications using technologies such as two dimensional electrophoresis  capillary electrophoresis  mass spectrometry  flow cytometry  microfluidics  and mechanically deposited  inkjet and photolithographic arrays 
we anticipate that we will face increased competition in the future as new companies enter the market with new technologies 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technology  evolving industry standards  changes in customer needs  
table of contents emerging competition and new product introductions 
one or more of our competitors may render our technology obsolete or uneconomical 
many of our competitors have greater financial and personnel resources and more experience in research and development than we have 
furthermore  the life sciences and pharmaceutical companies  which are our potential customers and strategic partners  could develop competing products 
if we are unable to develop enhancements to our technology and rapidly deploy new product offerings  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 
we may need additional capital in the future 
if additional capital is not available on acceptable terms  we may have to curtail or cease operations 
our future capital requirements will be substantial and will depend on many factors including our ability to successfully market our genetic analysis systems and services  the need for capital expenditures to support and expand our business  the progress and scope of our collaborative and independent research and development projects  the filing  prosecution and enforcement of patent claims and the success of our legal proceedings with applied biosystems and the appeal of a wrongful termination lawsuit 
we anticipate that our existing capital resources will enable us to maintain currently planned operations for at least to months 
however  we premise this expectation on our current operating plan  which may change as a result of many factors 
consequently  we may need additional funding sooner than anticipated 
our inability to raise capital would seriously harm our business and product development efforts 
in addition  we may choose to raise additional capital due to market conditions or strategic considerations even if we believe we have sufficient funds for our current or future operating plans 
to the extent that additional capital is raised through the sale of equity or convertible debt securities  the issuance of these securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
we currently have no credit facility or committed sources of capital other than an equipment lease line with million unused and available as of december  to the extent operating and capital resources are insufficient to meet future requirements  we will have to raise additional funds to continue the development and commercialization of our technologies 
these funds may not be available on favorable terms  or at all 
if adequate funds are not available on attractive terms  we may be required to curtail operations significantly or to obtain funds by entering into financing  supply or collaboration agreements on unattractive terms 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  we may be unable to achieve our goals 
we are highly dependent on our management and scientific personnel 
the loss of their services could adversely impact our ability to achieve our business objectives 
we will need to hire additional qualified personnel with expertise in molecular biology  chemistry  biological information processing  sales  marketing and technical support 
we compete for qualified management and scientific personnel with other biotechnology companies  universities and research institutions  particularly those focusing on genomics 
competition for these individuals  particularly in the san diego area  is intense  and the turnover rate can be high 
failure to attract and retain management and scientific personnel would prevent us from pursuing collaborations or developing our products or technologies 
our planned activities will require additional expertise in specific industries and areas applicable to the products developed through our technologies  including the life sciences and healthcare industries 
thus  we will need to add new personnel  including management  and develop the expertise of existing management 
the failure to do so could impair the growth of our business 
the ability to commercialize some of our current or future products may depend on third party collaborators over which we have no control 
we have in the past and may in the future enter into collaborative agreements to assist in the development and commercialization of our technology 
we have limited or no control over the resources that any partner or collaborator may devote to our products 
any of our present or future partners or collaborators may not perform their obligations as expected 
these partners or collaborators may breach or terminate their 
table of contents agreements with us or otherwise fail to meet their obligations or perform their collaborative activities successfully and in a timely manner 
further  any of our partners or collaborators may elect not to develop products arising out of our partnerships or collaborations or devote sufficient resources to the development  manufacture or commercialization of these products 
if any of these events occur  we may not be able to develop our technologies or commercialize our products and our ability to generate revenue will decrease 
we expect that our results of operations will fluctuate 
this fluctuation could cause our stock price to decline 
our operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations in our operating results could cause our stock price to fluctuate significantly or decline 
a large portion of our expenses is relatively fixed  including expenses for facilities  equipment and personnel 
in addition  we expect operating expenses to continue to increase significantly 
accordingly  if revenue does not grow as anticipated  we may not be able to reduce our operating losses 
due to the possibility of fluctuations in our revenue and expenses  we believe that quarterly comparisons of our operating results are not a good indication of our future performance 
for example  our genotyping system sales cycle is lengthy  the time period between our initial contact with a potential customer and installation is typically several months and includes site inspection  training and the effective demonstration of the installed system 
accordingly  revenues from system sales may occur in some quarters and not others 
oligonucleotide sales may fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on oligonucleotide needs for both our genotyping services product line and internal research 
in addition  sales for all of our products and services may fluctuate quarter to quarter depending on market conditions 
our operating results may not meet the expectations of stock market analysts and investors 
in that case  our stock price probably would decline item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio 
the fair market value of fixed rate securities may be adversely impacted by fluctuations in interest rates while income earned on floating rate securities may decline as a result of decreases in interest rates 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
we ensure the safety and preservation of our invested principal funds by limiting default risk  market risk and reinvestment risk 
we mitigate default risk by investing in investment grade securities 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of our interest sensitive financial instruments 
our equipment financings  amounting to million as of december   are all at fixed rates and therefore  have no exposure to changes in interest rates 
in january  we assumed a million mortgage in connection with the purchase of a new facility and related land 
the interest rate on this loan is fixed for a year period and consequently there is no exposure to increasing market interest rates 
we have operated primarily in the united states  we began our sales and marketing expansion into europe in the third quarter of other than employment related expenses for our european sales personnel  virtually all transactions to date have been made in us dollars 
accordingly  we have not had any significant exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations  nor do we have any foreign currency hedging instruments in place
