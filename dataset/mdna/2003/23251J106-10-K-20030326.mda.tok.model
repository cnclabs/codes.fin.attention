overview cybersource provides secure payment and risk management solutions to organizations that process orders for goods and services over the internet 
we connect businesses to a large network of payment processors  thereby enabling them to accept credit cards  electronic checks  and other forms of electronic payment 
our customers sell electronically through multiple channels that include not just the online model  but also call centers  interactive voice response units  kiosks  and point of sale environments 
we commenced operations in march as a division of beyond 
com 
on december   beyond 
com transferred assets and liabilities related to its commerce transaction processing services division to us 
we have incurred significant losses since our inception  and through december  had incurred cumulative losses of approximately million 
we expect to continue to incur substantial operating losses for the foreseeable future 
we derive our revenues from monthly commerce transaction processing fees  support service fees  professional services and the sale of enterprise software licenses and related maintenance 
transaction revenues are recognized in the period in which the transactions occur 
professional services revenue and support service fees are recognized as the related services are provided and costs are incurred 
enterprise software license revenue is recognized when the contract is signed  the software is delivered and the fee is collectible 
enterprise software maintenance revenue is recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
for the year ended december   no customer accounted for more than of revenues 
for the years ended december  and  one customer accounted for and of revenues  respectively  and during our business relationship with that customer was terminated 
given the fluctuations in headcount over the last several years  we believe that period to period comparisons of our revenues and operating results  including our gross margin and operating expenses as a percentage of total revenues  are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
moreover  we do not believe that our historical growth rates achieved prior to are indicative of future results 
management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations reflects the acquisition of expressgold 
com  inc expressgold which was completed in january and was accounted for as a pooling of interests  as well as the acquisition of paylinx corporation paylinx for the period from september   the date of acquisition  which was accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
critical accounting policies our financial statements are based on the selection and application of significant accounting policies  which require management to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following are some of the more critical judgment areas in the application of our accounting policies that currently affect our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab and statement of position  software revenue recognition  sop  as amended 
sab and sop require that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for services rendered and products delivered and the collectibility of those fees 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
as of september   we had not established vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for enterprise software license or maintenance revenue 
for enterprise software arrangements where maintenance is the only undelivered element  we had recognized the entire contract ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
beginning in the fourth quarter of  we changed our maintenance pricing and established vsoe of fair value for new maintenance arrangements 
as a result of establishing vsoe of fair value for maintenance revenue  effective october   we utilize the residual method of accounting as permitted by statement of position sop and recognize software license revenue in the period in which the contract is signed  the software is delivered and the fee is collectible 
the result of this change could materially impact enterprise software revenue recognized in the future as enterprise software license revenue will no longer be deferred and recognized ratably over the term of the maintenance period 
in addition  through september   we will continue to ratably recognize enterprise software revenue that had previously been deferred prior to the establishment of vsoe of fair value for maintenance revenue  while also recording enterprise software revenue relating to new agreements under the residual method of accounting in accordance with sop if we had not changed our maintenance pricing  established vsoe of fair value for new maintenance arrangements and  as a result  utilized the residual method of accounting as permitted by sop  our enterprise software revenue for the fourth quarter of would have been approximately million as compared to the million of enterprise software revenue recognized during the respective period 
we derive a significant portion of our professional services revenue from fixed price contracts  which require the accurate estimation of the cost  scope and duration of each engagement 
revenue and the related costs for these projects are recognized using the percentage of completion method 
estimates are made regarding time to complete the projects and revisions to estimates are reflected in the period in which changes become known 
if we do not accurately estimate the resources required or the scope of work to be performed  or do not manage our projects properly within the planned periods of time or satisfy obligations under the contracts  then future professional service margins may be significantly and negatively affected or losses on existing contracts may need to be recognized 
restructuring and other non recurring charges during fiscal year and  we recorded significant charges in connection with our restructuring plans as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements 
these restructuring charges include estimates pertaining to employee separation costs and the settlements of contractual obligations resulting from our actions 
in addition  we have estimated facility exit costs for certain under utilized facilities and have made assumptions regarding a sublessee s future rental rate  as well as the amount of time required to identify a sublessee 
the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers was to deteriorate further  resulting in their inability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
these estimates are based on historical bad debt experience and other known factors 
if the historical data we used to determine these estimates does not properly reflect future losses  additional allowances may be required 
legal contingencies we are currently involved in certain legal proceedings and are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes of these proceedings as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of accruals required  if any  for these contingencies are made after careful analysis 
as discussed in note of our consolidated financial statements  as of december   we do not believe our current proceedings will have a material impact on our consolidated financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarter or annual period could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions or as a result of the effectiveness of our strategies related to these proceedings 
results of operations years ended december  and revenues 
revenues decreased to million in  a decrease of approximately million or as compared to million in transaction and support revenues decreased to million in  a decrease of approximately as compared to million in we processed approximately million transactions in as compared to approximately million transactions in the decrease in revenue and transactions processed is due primarily to the loss of a significant customer in november of  which accounted for approximately of our revenues during professional services revenues increased to million in  an increase of approximately as compared to million in  due primarily to an increase in the average contract price of professional services projects 
enterprise software license and maintenance revenues decreased to million in  a decrease of approximately as compared to million in the decrease is due primarily to a decrease in number and dollar magnitude of new enterprise software sales that occurred during  offset  to a certain extent  by a change in our software license revenue recognition policy effective october  as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
if we had not changed our software revenue recognition policy  our enterprise software license and maintenance revenue would have been approximately million as compared to the million of enterprise software license and maintenance revenue recognized during cost of revenues 
transaction and support cost of revenues consist primarily of costs incurred in the delivery of e commerce transaction services  including personnel costs in our operations and customer support functions  depreciation of capital equipment used in our network infrastructure and costs related to the hosting of our servers at third party hosting centers in the united states and the united kingdom 
transaction and support cost of revenues decreased to million or of transaction and support revenues in from million or of transaction and support revenues in the decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of transaction and support revenues is primarily due to the reduction in personnel costs resulting from our restructurings for which we recorded charges during and  to a lesser extent  a decrease in depreciation expense 
professional services cost of revenues consist principally of personnel related costs and expenses and a portion of allocated overhead costs related to providing professional services 
professional services cost of revenues decreased to million or of professional services revenues for as compared to million or of professional services revenues for the decrease in absolute dollars and as a percentage of professional services revenue is due primarily to an increase in higher margin  fixed fee projects during as compared to enterprise software cost of revenues is comprised of customer support personnel costs and fulfillment costs 
enterprise software cost of revenues was million or of enterprise software revenues for as compared to million or of enterprise software revenues for the decrease in absolute dollars and enterprise software cost of revenues as a percentage of enterprise software revenue is due to the reduction in customer support personnel related costs resulting from our restructuring activities during also included in enterprise software cost of revenues in is million of amortized developed technology resulting from the acquisition of paylinx 
product development 
product development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs of employees engaged in the research  design and development of new services  and to a lesser extent  facility costs and related overhead 
product development expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to lower personnel related costs resulting from lower headcount than in the prior year and  to a lesser extent  lower overhead costs  which decreased by approximately million and million  respectively 
we expect product development expenses in to be consistent with sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of compensation of sales and marketing personnel  market research and advertising costs  and  to a lesser extent  facility costs and related overhead 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to lower sales and marketing personnel related costs  which decreased by approximately million in as compared to in addition  marketing program costs and other overhead costs decreased by approximately million in as compared to we expect sales and marketing expenses to decrease in absolute dollars in as a result of the reduction in sales and marketing personnel throughout general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation for administrative personnel  fees for outside professional services and  to a lesser extent  facility costs and related overhead 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million in from million in the decrease is primarily due to lower personnel related costs  which decreased by approximately million in as compared to and lower bad debt expense  legal expenses and outside service costs which decreased by million  million and million  respectively  in as compared to we expect general and administrative expenses in to be consistent with amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
during  we recorded million of amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets primarily as a result of our acquisition of paylinx 
goodwill and other intangible assets were being amortized on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of three to five years 
in november  we evaluated the carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets under the guidance of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets sfas 
based upon our analysis under sfas  we concluded that the goodwill and other intangible assets recorded as a result of our acquisition of paylinx were impaired 
as a result  we recorded a million write off of goodwill and other intangible assets in november see also restructuring and other non recurring charges 
deferred compensation amortization 
during  we recorded aggregate unearned compensation of million  of which million was recorded in connection with our acquisition of paylinx 
amortization expense related to deferred compensation was million in as of december   all remaining unamortized deferred compensation was written off as the personnel for which the deferred compensation had been recorded were no longer employed by us due to our restructurings 
restructuring and other non recurring charges 
we incurred restructuring and other non recurring charges of approximately million and million during and  respectively 
included in the charges were severance charges resulting from our realignment of resources to better manage and control our business  facility related charges resulting from the consolidation of our facilities and a non cash write off of goodwill and other intangible assets 
we estimate that expenses will be reduced by approximately million in compared to as a result of these restructuring and non recurring charges recorded in during  we will continue to evaluate the assumptions used in recording the facility related charges and may record additional charges if we are unable to sublease the under utilized space or if there is a further decline in the real estate market in mountain view  california or austin  texas 
we recorded restructuring charges of approximately million and million in and  respectively  which represent costs associated with the reduction of our worldwide workforce 
during  we reduced our workforce by employees of which were in sales and marketing  were in product development  and was in general and administrative services 
during  we reduced our workforce by employees of which were in professional services  sales and marketing  were in product development  were in operations and customer support  and were in general and administrative services 
we also recorded facility related restructuring charges of approximately million and million in and  respectively 
during  we closed our st 
louis facility  exited certain under utilized space in our mountain view  california and austin  texas facilities and consolidated our data centers 
included in the million charge in was million related to future lease payments for our st 
louis facility  as well as future lease payments  net of estimated sublease income  for the exited mountain view space 
also  included in the million was million related to the impairment of excess property and equipment and leasehold improvements primarily resulting from exiting the above facilities 
during  we reassessed our initial estimate of probable costs and the sublease timeline associated with subleasing excess leased facilities 
the reassessment was prompted by a further decline in the real estate market in the cities where those facilities are located 
after considering information provided to us by our real estate advisors  we concluded it was probable these facilities could not be subleased at rates originally considered nor could they be subleased in the timeframe originally planned 
as a result  we recorded an additional charge of million relating to the facilities located in mountain view  california and austin  texas 
this additional charge considers current lease rates for similar facilities as well as costs associated with the estimated added holding period through december see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
in november  we completed an analysis under sfas to determine if our goodwill and other intangible assets recorded in september upon our acquisition of paylinx were impaired 
we concluded that certain events and changes in circumstances  including a decrease in our market capitalization during fiscal and a decline in the estimated future growth of the enterprise payment software market  were indicators of impairment of the remaining goodwill and other intangible assets 
due to these indicators of impairment we performed an analysis of future undiscounted cash flows to determine the recoverability of the goodwill and other intangible assets 
based on our analysis  we recorded a million  non cash write off of the goodwill and other intangible assets 
loss on investment in joint venture 
on march   we entered into a joint venture agreement with japanese partners marubeni corporation and trans cosmos  inc to establish cybersource kk to provide commerce transaction services to the japanese market 
we will maintain a majority controlling interest in cybersource kk  subject to certain veto rights granted to the partners which expire when cybersource kk achieves at least million in quarterly revenue 
the joint venture is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting until the veto rights granted to the partners as described above expire 
after such date  we expect to consolidate the financial position and results of operations of cybersource kk during  we recorded a loss from investment in the joint venture of million as compared to million in as of june   we had recognized losses to the extent of our historical investment 
in february  subsequent to the balance sheet date  we increased our investment in cybersource kk by an additional  interest income expense  net 
interest income  net which consists of interest earnings on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments decreased to million in from million in this decrease is primarily due to a decline in average cash  cash equivalents and short term investments during as compared to as a result of our operating losses incurred during and  to a lesser extent  slightly lower investment yields 
we expect interest income to decrease in due to a lower cash  cash equivalents and short term investment balance 
interest expense decreased to  in from  in interest expense represents interest on capital lease obligations 
income taxes 
no provision for federal and state income taxes was recorded as we have incurred net operating losses since inception 
as of december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and million  respectively 
if we are not able to use them  the federal and state net operating loss carryforwards will expire in through the tax reform act of imposes substantial restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses and tax credits in the event of a corporation s ownership change  as defined in the internal revenue code 
our ability to utilize net operating loss carryforwards may be limited if such an ownership change occurs 
we have provided a full valuation allowance on our deferred tax assets because of the uncertainty regarding their realization 
our accounting for deferred taxes under statement of financial accounting standards no 
involves the evaluation of a number of factors concerning the realizability of our deferred tax assets 
in concluding that a full valuation allowance was required  we considered such factors as our history of operating losses and expected future losses and the nature of our deferred tax assets 
years ended december  and revenues 
revenues increased to million in  an increase of approximately million or as compared to million in transaction and support revenues increased to million in  an increase of approximately as compared to million in this increase is due to transaction volume increases resulting from new and existing customers as well as the result of a price increase that occurred in early our number of transactions processed was approximately million in as compared to approximately million in professional services revenues decreased to million in  a decrease of approximately as compared to million in  due to a decrease in the number and dollar magnitude of professional services projects during enterprise software license and maintenance revenues increased to million in  an increase of approximately as compared to million in software revenues for fiscal included revenues that were generated following our acquisition of paylinx on september   as compared to fiscal  which include a full year of software revenues

the increase in enterprise software cost of revenues is due to the fact that paylinx was acquired in september and  therefore  enterprise software cost of revenues for includes only four months of activity 
the decrease in enterprise software cost of revenues as a percentage of enterprise software revenue is due to economies of scale resulting from our increase in enterprise software revenue in product development 
product development expenses increased to million in compared to million in the increase is primarily due to higher personnel related costs of approximately million as a result of our acquisition of paylinx in september as well as the addition of other product development personnel throughout sales and marketing

as of december  and  we had immaterial amounts of accounts payable due to morrison foerster llp 
the terms of our contracts with the above related parties are consistent with our contracts with other independent parties

net cash used by financing activities in consists primarily of million of repurchases of common stock and million of principal payments on capital lease obligations  offset by million of proceeds from the exercise of employee stock options and the issuance of common stock under our employee stock purchase plan 
we believe that our cash and short term investment balances as of december  will be sufficient to meet our working capital and capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
we expect that we will continue to use our cash to fund expected operating losses 
in addition  our future capital requirements will depend on many factors including the level of investment we make in new businesses  new products or new technologies 
we currently have no agreements or understandings with respect to any future investments or acquisitions 
to the extent that our existing cash resources and future earnings are insufficient to fund our future activities  we may need to obtain additional equity or debt financing 
additional funds may not be available or  if available  we may not be able to obtain them on terms favorable to our stockholders and us 
the following is a table summarizing our significant commitments as of december   consisting of future minimum lease payments under all non cancelable capital and operating leases year ending december  capital leases operating leases total commitments risk factors set forth below and elsewhere in this annual report on form k  including in item  management s discussion and analysis  and in other documents we file with the securities and exchange commission are risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described herein we have a limited operating history and are subject to the risks encountered by early stage companies we have a limited operating history  and our business and prospects must be considered in light of the risks and uncertainties to which early stage companies are particularly exposed 
these risks include risks that the intense competition and rapid technological change in our industry could adversely affect market acceptance of all of our products and services  risks that we may not be able to expand our systems to handle increased traffic  resulting in slower response times and other difficulties in providing services to our merchant customers  risks that we may not be able to fully utilize relationships with our strategic partners and indirect sales channels  risks that any fluctuations in our quarterly operating results will be significant relative to our revenues  and risks that we may not be able to adequately integrate acquired businesses 
these risks are discussed in more detail below 
we cannot assure you that our business strategy will be successful or that we will successfully address these risks and the risks detailed below 
we have a history of losses  expect future losses and cannot assure you that we will achieve profitability we have not achieved profitability and cannot be certain that we will realize sufficient revenues to achieve profitability 
we will need to generate significantly higher revenues in order to achieve profitability and may not be able to sustain those revenues if achieved 
we have incurred significant net losses since our inception 
we incurred net losses of million in  million in and million in as of december   we had incurred cumulative losses of million 
the expected fluctuations of our quarterly results could cause our stock price to fluctuate or decline we expect that our quarterly operating results will fluctuate significantly in the future based upon a number of factors  many of which are not within our control 
we base our operating expenses on anticipated market growth and our operating expenses are relatively fixed in the short term 
as a result  if our revenues are lower than we expect  our quarterly operating results may not meet the expectations of public market analysts or investors  which could cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
our quarterly results may fluctuate in the future as a result of many factors  including the following changes in the number of transactions effected by our customers  especially as a result of seasonality  success of each customer s business  general economic conditions or regulatory requirements restricting our customers  our ability to attract new customers and to retain our existing customers  customer acceptance of our pricing model  customer acceptance of our software and our professional services offerings  modification in pricing methodology for software maintenance contracts which resulted in a change in our revenue recognition policy for the sale of enterprise software licenses effective in the fourth quarter of  the success of our sales and marketing programs  an interruption with one or more of our gateway processors and channel partners  seasonality of the retail sector  war or other international conflicts  and continued softening of the general us economy and the lack of available capital for our customers and potential future customers 
other factors that may affect our quarterly results are set forth elsewhere in this section 
as a result of these factors  our revenues are not predictable with any significant degree of certainty 
due to the uncertainty surrounding our revenues and expenses  we believe that quarter to quarter comparisons of our historical operating results should not be relied upon as an indicator of our future performance 
the intense competition in our industry could reduce or eliminate the demand for our products and services the market for our products and services is intensely competitive and subject to rapid technological change 
we expect competition to intensify in the future 
our primary source of competition comes from online merchants that develop custom systems 
these online merchants  who have made large initial investments to develop custom systems  may be less likely to adopt an outsourced transaction processing strategy or purchase our software 
we also face competition from developers of other systems for commerce transaction processing such as clear commerce  e one global an affiliate of first data corporation  fair  isaac  infospace  paymetrics  retail decisions  trintech and verisign 
in addition  visa has announced an internet payment authentication process with password protection which is designed to reduce the potential for unauthorized card use on the internet  which may compete with our fraud screen services 
further  other companies  including financial services and credit companies such as first data corporation may enter the market and provide competing services 
in the future  we may also compete with large internet centric companies that derive a significant portion of their revenues from e commerce and may offer  or provide a means for others to offer  e commerce transaction services 
many of our competitors have longer operating histories  substantially greater financial  technical  marketing or other resources  or greater name recognition than we do 
our competitors may be able to respond more quickly than we can to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements 
competition could seriously impede our ability to sell additional products and services on terms favorable to us 
our current and potential competitors may develop and market new technologies that render our existing or future products and services obsolete  unmarketable or less competitive 
for example  visa and mastercard have introduced cardholder authentication solutions that  if widely adopted by consumers  may reduce demand for our fraud screening services 
our current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with other solution providers  thereby increasing their ability to address the needs of our existing or prospective customers 
our current and potential competitors may establish or strengthen cooperative relationships with our current or future channel partners  thereby limiting our ability to sell products and services through these channels 
we expect that competitive pressures may result in the reduction of our prices or our market share or both  which could materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations or financial condition 
we may pursue strategic acquisitions and our business could be materially adversely affected if we fail to adequately integrate acquired businesses as part of our future business strategy  we may pursue strategic acquisitions of complementary businesses or technologies that would provide additional product or service offerings  additional industry expertise  a broader client base or an expanded geographic presence 
if we do not successfully integrate a strategic acquisition  or if the benefits of the transaction do not meet the expectation of financial or industry analysts  the market price of our common stock may decline 
any future acquisition could result in the use of significant amounts of cash  dilutive issuances of equity securities  or the incurrence of debt or amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating the operations  technologies  products and personnel of an acquired company  risks of entering markets in which we have either no or limited prior experiences  the diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  and the potential loss of key employees of an acquired company 
potential system failures and lack of capacity issues could negatively affect demand for our services our ability to deliver services to our merchants depends on the uninterrupted operation of our commerce transaction processing systems 
our systems and operations are vulnerable to damage or interruption from war  earthquake  fire  flood and other manmade or natural disasters  power loss  telecommunications or data network failure  operator negligence  improper operation by employees  physical and electronic break ins and similar events  and computer viruses 
despite the fact that we have implemented redundant servers in third party hosting centers located in santa clara  california  and mesa  arizona  we still experience service interruptions for the reasons listed above and a variety of other reasons 
if our redundant servers are not available  we may not have sufficient business interruption insurance to compensate us for resulting losses 
we have experienced periodic interruptions  affecting all or a portion of our systems  which we believe will continue to occur from time to time 
for example  on november   our services were unavailable for approximately ten hours due to an internal system problem 
we have also subsequently experienced service interruptions of lesser duration 
in addition  any interruption in our systems that impairs our ability to provide services could damage our reputation and reduce demand for our services 
our success also depends on our ability to grow  or scale  our commerce transaction systems to accommodate increases in the volume of traffic on our systems  especially during peak periods of demand 
we may not be able to anticipate increases in the use of our systems or successfully expand the capacity of our network infrastructure 
our inability to expand our systems to handle increased traffic could result in system disruptions  slower response times and other difficulties in providing services to our merchant customers  which could materially harm our business 
a breach of our e commerce security measures could reduce demand for our services a requirement of the continued growth of e commerce is the secure transmission of confidential information over public networks 
we rely on public key cryptography  an encryption method that utilizes two keys  a public and a private key  for encoding and decoding data  and digital certificate technology  or identity verification  to provide the security and authentication necessary for secure transmission of confidential information 
regulatory and export restrictions may prohibit us from using the most secure cryptographic protection available and thereby expose us to an increased risk of data interception 
a party who is able to circumvent security measures could misappropriate proprietary information or interrupt our operations 
any compromise or elimination of security could reduce demand for our services 
we may be required to expend significant capital and other resources to protect against security breaches and to address any problems they may cause 
concerns over the security of the internet and other online transactions and the privacy of users may also inhibit the growth of the internet and other online services generally  and the web in particular  especially as a means of conducting commercial transactions 
because our activities involve the storage and transmission of proprietary information  such as credit card numbers  security breaches could damage our reputation and expose us to a risk of loss or litigation and possible liability 
our security measures may not prevent security breaches  and failure to prevent security breaches may disrupt our operations 
if we are not able to fully utilize relationships with our sales alliances  we may experience lower revenue growth and higher operating costs our future growth will depend in part on the success of our relationships with existing and future sales alliances that market our products and services to their merchant accounts 
if these relationships are not successful or do not develop as quickly as we anticipate  our revenue growth may be adversely affected 
accordingly  we may have to increase our sales and marketing expenses in an attempt to secure additional merchant accounts 
our market is subject to rapid technological change and to compete we must continually enhance our systems to comply with evolving standards to remain competitive  we must continue to enhance and improve the responsiveness  functionality and features of our products and services and the underlying network infrastructure 
the internet and the e commerce industry are characterized by rapid technological change  changes in user requirements and preferences  frequent new product and service introductions embodying new technologies  and the emergence of new industry standards and practices that could render our technology and systems obsolete 
our success will depend  in part  on our ability to both internally develop and license leading technologies to enhance our existing products and services and develop new products and services 
we must continue to address the increasingly sophisticated and varied needs of our merchants  and respond to technological advances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost effective and timely basis 
the development of proprietary technology involves significant technical and business risks 
we may fail to develop new technologies effectively or to adapt our proprietary technology and systems to merchant requirements or emerging industry standards 
if we are unable to adapt to changing market conditions  merchant requirements or emerging industry standards  our business would be materially harmed 
revenues from professional services may decrease further in the year ended december   we experienced strong growth in the demand for our professional services and were engaged to complete a large project with related revenue in the amount of approximately million 
since then  we have not been engaged  and in the future may not be engaged  for additional projects of similar or larger size  and the demand for professional services may decrease 
for instance  professional services revenue decreased from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  in addition  given recent reductions in our professional services workforce  if we are engaged on larger projects  we may not be able to hire the resources necessary to meet future demand 
some of our larger customers have businesses that focus on the internet and may not be able to obtain necessary funding a significant number of our customers have internet based business models 
some of these customers are among our largest customers 
many of these customers may require substantial working capital to operate their businesses  may not have adequate funds available and may be dependent upon the capital markets for funding 
our customers may not be able to raise the additional capital required to fund their businesses and  as a result  we may experience a decrease in our customer base  a reduction in recurring revenue and an increase in our bad debt expense 
the demand for our products and services could be negatively affected by a reduced growth of e commerce or delays in the development of the internet infrastructure sales of goods and services over the internet do not currently represent a significant portion of overall sales of goods and services 
we depend on the growing use and acceptance of the internet as an effective medium of commerce by merchants and customers in the united states and internationally 
rapid growth in the use of and interest in the internet is a relatively recent development 
in particular  the sale of goods and services over the internet has gained acceptance more slowly outside of the united states 
we cannot be certain that acceptance and use of the internet will continue to develop or that a sufficiently broad base of merchants and consumers will adopt  and continue to use  the internet as a medium of commerce 
the increase in the significance of the internet as a commercial marketplace may occur more slowly than anticipated for a number of reasons  including potentially inadequate development of the necessary network infrastructure or delayed development of enabling technologies and performance improvements 
if the number of internet users  or the use of internet resources by existing users  continues to grow  it may overwhelm the existing internet infrastructure 
delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity could also have a detrimental effect 
these factors could result in slower response times or adversely affect usage of the internet  resulting in lower numbers of commerce transactions and lower demand for our products and services 
we may have an accounts receivable concentration risk some of our enterprise software and professional services contracts are of a large  relative magnitude which result in a higher concentration of our accounts receivable balance at times 
for example  while no customer accounted for more than of our accounts receivable balance as of december   approximately of our accounts receivable balance was due from one professional services customer as of march  if we lose key personnel  we may not be able to successfully manage our business and achieve our objectives we believe our future success will depend upon our ability to retain our key management personnel  including william s 
mckiernan  our chief executive officer  and other key members of management because of their experience and knowledge regarding the development  special opportunities and challenges of our business 
none of our current key employees is subject to an employment contract 
we may not be successful in attracting and retaining key employees in the future 
we may not be able to adequately protect our proprietary technology and may be infringing upon third party intellectual property rights our success depends upon our proprietary technology 
we rely on a combination of patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret rights  confidentiality procedures and licensing arrangements to establish and protect our proprietary rights 
as part of our confidentiality procedures  we enter into non disclosure agreements with our employees  contractors  vendors and potential customers and alliances 
despite these precautions  third parties could copy or otherwise obtain and use our technology without authorization  or develop similar technology independently 
effective protection of intellectual property rights may be unavailable or limited in foreign countries 
we cannot assure you that the protection of our proprietary rights will be adequate or that our competitors will not independently develop similar technology  duplicate our products and services or design around any patents or other intellectual property rights we hold 
we also cannot assure you that third parties will not claim that the technology employed in providing our current or future products and services infringe upon their rights 
we have not conducted any search to determine whether any of our products and services or technologies may be infringing upon patent rights of third parties 
as the number of products and services in our market increases and functionalities increasingly overlap  companies such as ours may become increasingly subject to infringement claims 
in addition  these claims also might require us to enter into royalty or license agreements 
any infringement claims  with or without merit  could absorb significant management time and lead to costly litigation 
if required to do so  we may not be able to obtain royalty or license agreements  or obtain them on terms acceptable to us 
we may not be able to secure funding in the future necessary to operate our business as planned we require substantial working capital to fund our business 
we have had significant operating losses and negative cash flow from operations since inception and expect this to continue in we expect to use the net proceeds of our equity financings to continue investments in service development  to fund sales and marketing activities  to fund product development  to fund continued operations  repurchase shares of our stock in the open market and potentially to make future acquisitions 
we believe that our existing capital resources will be sufficient to meet our capital requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  our capital requirements depend on several factors  including the rate of market acceptance of our products and services  the ability to expand our customer base  the growth of sales and marketing and other factors 
if capital requirements vary materially from those currently planned  we may require additional financing sooner than anticipated 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of equity securities  the percentage ownership of our stockholders will be reduced  and these equity securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of the holders of our common stock 
additional financing may not be available when needed on terms favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms  we may be unable to develop or enhance our products and services  take advantage of future opportunities or respond to competitive pressures 
we may become subject to government regulation and legal uncertainties that would adversely affect our financial results we are not currently subject to direct regulation by any domestic or foreign governmental agency  other than regulations applicable to businesses generally  export control laws and laws or regulations directly applicable to e commerce 
however  due to the increasing usage of the internet  it is possible that a number of laws and regulations may be applicable or may be adopted in the future with respect to conducting business over the internet covering issues such as taxes  user privacy  pricing  content  right to access personal data  copyrights  distribution  and characteristics and quality of products and services 
for example  we believe that our fraud screen service may require us to comply with the fair credit reporting act the act 
as a precaution  we have implemented processes that we believe will enable us to comply with the act if we were deemed a consumer reporting agency 
complying with the act requires us to provide information about personal data stored by us 
failure to comply with the act could result in claims being made against us by individual consumers and the federal trade commission 
furthermore  the growth and development of the market for e commerce may prompt more stringent consumer protection laws that may impose additional burdens on those companies conducting business online 
the adoption of additional laws or regulations may decrease the growth of the internet or other online services  which could  in turn  decrease the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing business 
the applicability of existing laws governing issues such as property ownership  copyrights  encryption and other intellectual property issues  taxation  libel  export or import matters and personal privacy to the internet is uncertain 
the vast majority of laws were adopted prior to the broad commercial use of the internet and related technologies 
as a result  they do not contemplate or address the unique issues of the internet and related technologies 
changes to these laws intended to address these issues  including some recently proposed changes in the united states regarding taxation and encryption and in the european union regarding contract formation and privacy  could create uncertainty in the internet marketplace and impose additional costs and other burdens 
these uncertainties  costs and burdens could reduce demand for our products and services or increase the cost of doing business due to increased litigation costs or increased service delivery costs 
our international business exposes us to additional foreign risks products and services provided to merchants outside the united states accounted for  and of our revenues in  and  respectively 
in march  we entered into a joint venture agreement with japanese partners marubeni corporation and trans cosmos  inc and established cybersource kk to provide commerce transaction services to the japanese market 
conducting business outside of the united states is subject to additional risks that may affect our ability to sell our products and services and result in reduced revenues  including changes in regulatory requirements  reduced protection of intellectual property rights  evolving privacy laws in europe  the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws  and political or economic instability or constraints on international trade 
in addition  some software contains encryption technology that renders it subject to export restrictions and we may become liable to the extent we violate these restrictions 
we might not successfully market  sell and distribute our products and services in local markets and we cannot be certain that one or more of these factors will not materially adversely affect our future international operations  and consequently  our business  financial condition and operating results 
also  sales of our products and services conducted through our subsidiary in the united kingdom are denominated in pounds sterling 
we may experience fluctuations in revenues or operating expenses due to fluctuations in the value of the pound sterling relative to the us dollar 
we do not currently enter into transactions with the specific purpose to hedge against currency exchange fluctuations 
our stock price may fluctuate substantially the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including the following the announcement of new products  services or enhancements by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
these factors and fluctuations  as well as general economic  political and market conditions may materially adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
the anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation could adversely affect the rights of the holders of our common stock anti takeover provisions of delaware law and our certificate of incorporation may make a change in control more difficult to finalize  even if a change in control would be beneficial to the stockholders 
these provisions may allow the board of directors to prevent changes in our management and controlling interests 
under delaware law  our board of directors may adopt additional anti takeover measures in the future 
one anti takeover provision that we have is the ability of our board of directors to determine the terms of preferred stock and issue preferred stock without the approval of the holders of the common stock 
our certificate of incorporation allows the issuance of up to  shares of preferred stock 
as of december   there are no shares of preferred stock outstanding 
however  because the rights and preferences of any series of preferred stock may be set by the board of directors in its sole discretion without approval of the holders of the common stock  the rights and preferences of this preferred stock may be superior to those of the common stock 
accordingly  the rights of the holders of common stock may be adversely affected 
our fraud detection services and marketing agreement with visa usa expires in july in july  we entered into a new agreement with visa usa to jointly develop and promote the cybersource advanced fraud screen service enhanced by visa for use in the united states 
under the terms of the agreement  visa has agreed to promote and market the new product to its member financial institutions and internet merchants 
the agreement expires in july  but can be terminated by either party after the first year with ninety days prior written notice 
after july  the agreement renews automatically for additional periods of one year  unless terminated by either party 
recently enacted and proposed changes in securities laws and regulations are likely to increase our costs the sarbanes oxley act of that became law in july requires changes in some of our corporate governance and securities disclosure or compliance practices 
that act also requires the sec to promulgate new rules on a variety of subjects  in addition to rule proposals already made  and nasdaq has proposed revisions to its requirements for companies that are nasdaq listed 
we expect these developments to increase our legal compliance costs  and to make some activities more time consuming 
we are presently evaluating and monitoring regulatory developments and cannot estimate the timing or magnitude of additional costs we may incur as a result 
item a qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk we provide our services to customers primarily in the united states and  to a lesser extent  in europe and elsewhere throughout the world 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors  such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
all sales are currently made in us dollars or pound sterling 
a strengthening of the us dollar or the pound sterling could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates 
due to the nature of our cash equivalents and short term investments  which are primarily money market funds  government bonds and commercial paper  we have concluded that there is no material market risk exposure
