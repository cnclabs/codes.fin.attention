the number of employees at december  decreased percent to approximately  compared with  at december  pension costs for totaled million compared with pension income of million in  and principally impacted fms 
the increase in pension costs is attributable primarily to the us pension plan and reflects the adverse effect of negative pension asset returns in as well as a declining interest rate environment resulting in a lower discount rate used to measure benefit obligations

the company believes that its carrying values and estimated sales proceeds for revenue earning equipment are appropriate 
however  a greater than anticipated decline in the market for used vehicles may require the company to further adjust such values and estimates 
equipment rental primarily consists of rental costs on revenue earning equipment in fms 
equipment rental costs decreased percent to million in compared with the decrease in equipment rental is due to a decrease in the number of leased vehicles and lower lease rates due to a changing mix of leased units

the company will continue to evaluate selective acquisitions in fms  scs and dcc in financing and other funding transactions the company utilizes external capital to support growth in its asset based product lines 
the company has a variety of financing alternatives available to fund its capital needs 
these alternatives include long term and medium term public and private debt  asset backed securities  bank term loans  leasing arrangements  bank credit facilities  commercial paper and sale of receivable program 
total debt was billion at december   a decrease of percent from december  the company issued million of medium term notes and retired million of medium term notes in us commercial paper outstanding at december  decreased to million  compared with million at december  during  the company added capital lease obligations of million primarily in connection with the extension of existing operating leases of revenue earning equipment 
the company s foreign debt was million at december   a decrease of approximately million from december  the company s percentage of variable rate financing obligations including notional value of swap agreements was percent at december   compared with percent at december  generally  the company targets a variable rate exposure of to percent of total obligations 
debt totaled billion at the end of compared with billion at the end of the decrease in debt in was principally due to repayment of million in debentures and a decrease of million in commercial paper borrowings  which were repaid with proceeds of sale leaseback transactions described below 
in addition to the company s reduced debt in  receivables sold decreased million in compared with decreased debt levels and reduced overall funding needs were generally the result of reduced levels of capital expenditures on revenue earning equipment 
the company s debt to equity and related ratios were as follows december in thousands on balance sheet debt debt to equity total obligations excluding securitizations total obligations to equity excluding securitizations total obligations including securitizations total obligations to equity including securitizations debt to equity consists of the company s on balance sheet debt for the period divided by total equity 
total obligations to equity represents debt plus the following off balance sheet funding  all divided by total equity receivables sold  and the present value of minimum lease payments and guaranteed residual values under operating leases for equipment  discounted at the interest rate implicit in the lease 
total obligations to equity  including securitizations  consists of total obligations  described above  plus the present value of contingent rentals under the company s securitizations assuming customers make all lease payments on securitized vehicles when contractually due  discounted at the average interest rate paid to investors in the trust  all divided by total equity 
off balance sheet obligations with special purpose entities  primarily securitizations  were approximately million and million at december  and  respectively 
all leverage ratios in were impacted by a non cash equity charge of million after tax recorded as of december  in connection with additional minimum pension liability adjustments see pension information below for additional discussion 
excluding the pension equity charge  all ratios declined in as a result of the company s reduced funding needs attributable to decreases in purchases of revenue earning equipment 
for  the company anticipates these ratios to increase as a result of higher anticipated capital spending 
the company participates in an agreement  as amended from time to time  to sell with limited recourse  trade receivables on a revolving and uncommitted basis 
this agreement expires in july in june  the company reduced the amount available for sale under its trade receivable facility from million to million as a result of a reduction in overall capital needs 
the company sells receivables in order to fund operations  particularly when the cost of such sales is cost effective compared with other means of funding  notably  commercial paper 
receivables are sold first to a bankruptcy remote special purpose entity  ryder receivables funding llc rrf llc  that is included in the company s consolidated financial statements 
rrf llc then sells certain receivables to unrelated commercial entities at a loss  which approximates the purchasers financing cost of issuing its own commercial paper backed by the trade receivables over the period of anticipated collection 
the company is responsible for servicing receivables sold  but has no retained interests 
at december  and  the outstanding balance of receivables sold pursuant to this agreement was and million  respectively 
losses on receivable sales associated with this program were million in  million in and million in and are included in miscellaneous income expense  net 
rrf llc records estimates of losses under the recourse provision which are included in accrued liabilities 
since no receivables were sold at the end of  no amount of available recourse or recognized recourse obligation existed as of december  at december   the amount of available recourse was million and the estimated losses under the recourse obligation attributed to receivables sold were million 
the decrease in trade receivables sold since december  is due to a reduced need for cash as a result of lower working capital needs 
see receivables in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the company s sale of receivables 
the company s ability to access unsecured debt in the capital markets is linked to both its short and long term debt ratings 
these ratings are intended to provide guidance to investors in determining the credit risk associated with particular company securities based on current information obtained by the rating agencies from the company or other sources that such agencies consider to be reliable 
lower ratings generally result in higher borrowing costs as well as reduced access to capital markets 
the company s debt ratings as of december  were as follows short long term term moody s investors service p baa standard poor s ratings group a bbb fitch ratings f bbb on december   moody s investor service confirmed the company s long term debt rating and changed its long term debt rating outlook to negative 
the company s debt ratings have remained unchanged since the first quarter of a downgrade of the company s debt below investment grade level would limit the company s ability to issue commercial paper and would result in the company no longer having the ability to sell trade receivables under the agreement described above or participate in existing derivative transactions 
as a result  the company would have to rely on other established funding sources described below 
the company has established an million global revolving credit facility 
the facility is composed of million which matures in may and is renewable annually and is in the process of being renewed  and million which matures in may the primary purposes of the credit facility are to finance working capital and provide support for the issuance of commercial paper 
at the company s option  the interest rate on borrowings under the credit facility is based on libor  prime  federal funds or local equivalent rates 
the credit facility s annual facility fee ranges from to basis points applied to the total facility of million based on the company s current credit ratings 
at december   million was available under this global credit facility 
of this amount  million was available at a maturity of less than one year 
foreign borrowings of million were outstanding under the facility at december  in order to maintain availability of funding  the global revolving credit facility requires the company to maintain a ratio of debt to consolidated tangible net worth  as defined  of less than or equal to percent 
the ratio at december  was percent 
in september  the company filed an million shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission sec 
proceeds from debt issues under the shelf registration have been and are expected to be used for capital expenditures  debt refinancing and general corporate purposes 
at december   the company had million of debt securities available for issuance under this shelf registration statement 
as of december  the company had the following amounts available to fund operations under the aforementioned facilities in millions global revolving credit facility limited to less than one year shelf registration statement trade receivables facility uncommitted the company believes such facilities  along with other funding sources  will be sufficient to fund operations in off balance sheet arrangements in addition to the financing activities described above  the company executes sale leaseback transactions with third party financial institutions as well as with substantive special purpose entities spes which facilitate sale leaseback transactions with multiple third party investors vehicle securitizations 
in general  sale leaseback transactions result in a reduction in revenue earning equipment and debt on the balance sheet  as proceeds from the sale of revenue earning equipment are primarily used to repay debt 
accordingly  sale leaseback transactions will result in reduced depreciation and interest expense and increased equipment rental expense 
sale leaseback transactions including vehicle securitizations are generally executed from time to time in order to lower the total cost of funding the company s operations  to diversify the company s funding among different classes of investors eg regional banks  pension plans  insurance companies  etc  and to diversify the company s funding among different types of funding instruments 
the company did not enter into any sale leaseback or securitization transactions during the year ended december  proceeds from sale leaseback transactions were million and million in and  respectively 
under the transactions  the vehicles were sold for approximately their carrying value 
the sale leaseback transaction in was a vehicle securitization in which the company sold a beneficial interest in certain vehicles subject to leases to a separately rated and unconsolidated vehicle lease trust and subsequently entered into an operating lease program operating lease with the trust 
a prospectus for the transaction is on file with the sec 
the company has executed other similar vehicle securitization transactions in previous years 
the company retained an interest in the vehicle lease trust in the form of subordinated notes issued at the date of the sale 
the company has provided credit enhancement for the sale in the form of a one time up front cash reserve deposit and a pledge of the subordinated notes  including interest thereon  as additional security for the vehicle securitization trusts to the extent that payments under the program operating lease are not made due to delinquencies and incurred losses under the program operating lease and related vehicle sales 
the trust relies on collections from the program operating lease  sales proceeds from the disposition of such vehicles and credit enhancements to make payments to investors 
the trust is solely liable for such payments to investors  who are all independent of the company 
other than the credit enhancement noted above  the company does not guarantee investors interests in the securitization trust 
see leases in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion on the company s securitization transactions 
the following table summarizes the company s undiscounted on and off balance sheet contractual cash obligations and contingent rentals at december  thereafter total in thousands long term debt capital leases total debt operating leases a total contractual cash obligations contingent rentals b total a the amounts in the previous table are based upon the assumption that revenue earning equipment will remain on lease for the length of time specified by the respective lease agreements 
no effect has been given to renewals  cancellations  contingent rentals or future rate changes  except as described below for vehicle securitization transactions 
b contingent rentals relate to the company s vehicle securitization transactions 
the timing and amount of payment of rent by the company for securitized vehicles is dependent on the timing and amount of payments received from the company s customers for use of such vehicles  as stipulated by the program operating lease 
for purposes of this presentation  the company has assumed that the full monthly payment for each vehicle is received from the customer exactly when such payment is due  and that there are no defaults  prepayments or early termination of leases between the company and its customers 
contingent rentals in the table above are estimated based upon this assumption 
the actual amount and timing of contingent rentals due by the company may vary from that assumed above 
guarantees in the ordinary course of business  the company provides certain guarantees or indemnifications to third parties as part of certain lease  financing and sales agreements 
certain guarantees and indemnifications  whereby the company may be contingently required to make a payment to a third party  are required to be disclosed even if the likelihood of payment is considered remote 
the company s financial guarantees as of december  consisted of the following maximum exposure carrying amount guarantee of guarantee of liability in millions vehicle residual value guarantees sale and leaseback arrangements end of term guarantees a finance lease program used vehicle financing standby letters of credit total a amounts exclude contingent rentals associated with residual value guarantees on certain vehicles held under operating leases for which the guarantees are conditional upon early termination of the lease agreement as a result of a vehicle disposal 
the company s maximum exposure for early lease termination guarantees was approximately million  with million recorded as a liability at december  as more fully described in the leases note to consolidated financial statements  the company has entered into transactions for the sale and operating leaseback of revenue earning equipment 
the transactions resulted in the company providing the lessors with residual value guarantees at the end of the lease term 
therefore  to the extent that the sales proceeds from the final disposition of the assets are lower than the residual value guarantee  the company is required to make payment for the remaining amount 
the company s maximum exposure for such guarantees  including credit enhancements on vehicle securitizations  was approximately million  with million recorded as a liability at december  under a separate arrangement  the company also provides vehicle residual value guarantees to an independent third party relating to a customer finance lease program 
to the extent that the sales proceeds from the final disposition of the assets are lower than the residual value guarantee  the company is required to make payment for the remaining amount 
at december   the company s maximum exposure under this program was approximately million  of which million was recorded 
the company maintains an agreement with an independent third party for the financing of used vehicle purchases by its customers 
under the terms of the agreement  the company finances the customer s purchase and immediately sells its rights under the finance contract to the financial institution 
the company provides a guarantee on defaulted contracts up to a maximum of percent of the outstanding principal balances 
at the end of  the company s maximum exposure under the guarantee was approximately million 
the recorded liability under this guarantee at december  was million 
at december   the company had outstanding letters of credit that primarily guarantee various insurance activities 
certain of these letters of credit guarantee insurance activities associated with insurance claim liabilities transferred in conjunction with the sale of certain businesses reported as discontinued operations in previous years 
to date  such insurance claims  representing per claim deductibles payable under third party insurance policies  have been paid by the companies that assumed such liabilities 
however  if all or a portion of such assumed claims are unable to be paid  the third party insurers may have recourse against certain of the outstanding letters of credit provided by the company in order to satisfy the unpaid claims deductible 
no liability has been recorded by the company for its guarantee of such claims  however  the total assumed liabilities in which the company guarantees payment was estimated to be approximately million at december  pension information as of december   the company recorded a non cash equity charge of million after tax in connection with the accrual of an additional minimum pension liability 
the equity charge reflects the under funded status of the company s qualified pension plans primarily us qualified plan resulting from declines in the market value of equity securities and declines in long term interest rates 
although this non cash charge impacts reported leverage ratios  it does not affect the company s compliance with existing financial debt covenants 
the funded status of the company s pension plans is dependent upon many factors  including returns on invested assets and the level of market interest rates 
while the company is not legally required to make a contribution to fund its us pension plan until september  it reviews pension assumptions regularly and may from time to time make contributions to its pension plans 
the company made pension contributions of million to global pension plans in the company estimates the present value of its required pension plan contributions over the next years to be approximately million for the us pension plan  its primary plan 
market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates  foreign exchange rates and fuel prices 
the company manages such exposures in several ways  including  in certain circumstances  the use of a variety of derivative financial instruments when deemed prudent 
the company does not enter into leveraged derivative financial transactions or use derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to debt obligations 
the company s interest rate risk management program objective is to limit the impact of interest rate changes on earnings and cash flows and to lower overall borrowing costs 
the company manages its exposure to interest rate risk through the proportion of fixed rate and variable rate debt in the total debt portfolio 
from time to time  the company also uses interest rate swap and cap agreements to manage its fixed rate and variable rate exposure and to better match the repricing of its debt instruments to that of its portfolio of assets 
see financial instruments and risk management note to consolidated financial statements for further discussion on outstanding interest rate swap and cap agreements at december  at december   the company had million of fixed rate debt excluding capital leases with a weighted average interest rate of percent and a fair value of million  including the effects of interest rate swaps 
a hypothetical percent decrease or increase in the december  market interest rates would impact the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt by approximately million 
at december   the company had billion of fixed rate debt excluding capital leases with a weighted average interest rate of percent and a fair value of billion 
a hypothetical percent decrease or increase in the december  market interest rates would impact the fair value of the company s fixed rate debt by approximately million 
the company estimates the fair value of derivatives based on dealer quotations 
at december   the company had million of variable rate debt  including the effects of interest rate swaps  which effectively changed million of fixed rate debt instruments with a weighted average interest rate of percent to libor based floating rate debt at a current weighted average interest rate of percent 
changes in the fair value of the interest rate swaps are offset by changes in the fair value of the debt instruments and no net gain or loss is recognized in earnings 
the fair value of the interest rate swap agreements at december  totaled million 
as of december   the company had million of variable rate debt with a weighted average interest rate of percent 
interest expense under the majority of these arrangements are based on libor 
the company currently estimates that a hypothetical percent increase in market interest rates would impact pre tax income by million 
exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates relates primarily to foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies and to the carrying value of net investments in foreign subsidiaries 
the company manages its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk related to foreign operations buying  selling and financing in currencies other than local currencies by naturally offsetting assets and liabilities not denominated in local currencies 
the company also uses foreign currency option contracts and forward agreements from time to time to hedge foreign currency transactional exposure 
the company does not generally hedge the translation exposure related to its net investment in foreign subsidiaries  since the company generally has no near term intent to repatriate funds from such subsidiaries 
based on the overall level of transactions denominated in other than local currencies  the lack of transactions between the company and its foreign subsidiaries and the level of net investment in foreign subsidiaries  the exposure to market risk for changes in foreign exchange rates is not considered material 
at december   the company had a million cross currency swap outstanding used to hedge its investment in a foreign subsidiary 
exposure to market risk for fluctuations in fuel prices relates to a portion of the company s service contracts for which the cost of fuel is integral to service delivery and the service contract does not have a mechanism to adjust for increases in fuel prices 
as of december   the company had various fuel purchase arrangements in place to ensure delivery of fuel at market rates in the event of fuel shortages 
none of the company s current fuel purchase arrangements fix the price of fuel to be purchased and as such the company is exposed to fluctuations in fuel prices 
increases and decreases in the price of fuel are generally passed on to customers and have only a minor effect on profitability 
the company believes the exposure to fuel price fluctuations would not materially impact the company s results of operations  cash flows or financial position 
environmental matters the operations of the company involve storing and dispensing petroleum products  primarily diesel fuel  regulated under environmental protection laws 
these laws require the company to eliminate or mitigate the effect of such substances on the environment 
in response to these requirements  the company has upgraded operating facilities and implemented various programs to detect and minimize contamination 
capital expenditures related to these programs totaled approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively 
the company incurred environmental expenses of million  million and million in  and  respectively  which included remediation costs as well as normal recurring expenses  such as licensing  testing and waste disposal fees 
the increase in environmental expense in and reflected the impact of lower claim recoveries compared with the prior year 
based on current circumstances and the present standards imposed by government regulations  environmental expenses should not increase materially from levels in the near term 
the ultimate cost of the company s environmental liabilities cannot presently be projected with certainty due to the presence of several unknown factors  primarily the level of contamination  the effectiveness of selected remediation methods  the stage of management s investigation at individual sites and the recoverability of such costs from third parties 
based upon information presently available  management believes that the ultimate disposition of these matters  although potentially material to the results of operations in any single year  will not have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition or liquidity 
see environmental matters in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
accounting matters critical accounting estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with us gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions 
the company s significant accounting policies are described in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
certain of these policies require the application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  changes in the business environment and other factors that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
different estimates that could have been applied in the current period or changes in the accounting estimates that are reasonably likely  can result in a material impact on the company s financial condition and operating results in the current and future periods 
management periodically reviews the development  selection and disclosure of these critical accounting estimates with the company s audit committee 
the following discussion  which should be read in conjunction with the descriptions in the notes to consolidated financial statements  is furnished for additional insight into certain accounting estimates that management considers to be critical 
depreciation and residual value guarantees the company periodically reviews and adjusts the residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment of its fms business segment as described in summary of significant accounting policies revenue earning equipment  operating property and equipment and depreciation and residual value guarantees in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
reductions in residual values the price at which the company ultimately expects to dispose of revenue earning equipment or useful lives will result in an increase in depreciation expense over the life of the equipment 
the company reviews residual values and useful lives of revenue earning equipment on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary for specific groups of revenue earning equipment 
reviews are performed based on vehicle class  generally subcategories of trucks  tractors and trailers by weight and usage 
the company considers such factors as current and expected future market price trends on used vehicles  expected life of vehicles included in the fleet and extent of alternative uses for leased vehicles eg rental fleet  scs and dcc applications 
in its estimates  the company also makes certain assumptions in establishing residual values with respect to future market price trends and the expected recovery of the existing weak used truck market 
as a result  future depreciation expense rates are subject to change based upon changes in these factors 
based on the mix of revenue earning equipment at december   a percent decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase depreciation expense in by approximately million 
the company also leases vehicles under operating lease agreements 
certain of these agreements contain limited guarantees for a portion of the residual values of the equipment 
results of the reviews described above for owned equipment are also applied to equipment under operating lease 
the amount of residual value guarantees expected to be paid is recognized as rent expense over the expected remaining term of the lease 
at december   total liabilities for residual value guarantees of million were included in accrued expenses for those payable in less than one year and in other non current liabilities 
while management believes that the amounts are adequate  changes to management s estimates of residual value guarantees may occur due to changes in the market for used vehicles  the condition of the vehicles at the end of the lease and inherent limitations in the estimation process 
based on the existing mix of vehicles under operating lease agreements at december   a percent decrease in expected vehicle residual values would increase rent expense in by approximately million 
pension plans the company applies actuarial methods to determine the annual net periodic pension expense and pension plan liabilities on an annual basis 
each december  the company reviews actual experience compared with the more significant assumptions used and makes adjustments to the assumptions  if warranted 
in determining its annual estimate of net periodic pension cost  the company is required to make an evaluation of critical factors such as discount rate  expected long term rate of return and expected increase in compensation levels 
discount rates are based upon an expected benefit payments duration analysis and the equivalent average yield for high quality corporate fixed income investments 
long term rate of return assumptions are based on actuarial review of the company s asset allocation strategy and long term expected asset returns 
the rate of increase in compensation levels is reviewed with the actuaries based upon salary experience 
accounting guidance applicable to pension plans does not require immediate recognition of the effects of a deviation between actual and assumed experience or the revision of an estimate 
this approach allows the favorable and unfavorable effects that fall within an acceptable range to be netted 
although this netting occurs outside the basic financial statements  disclosure of the net amount is presented as an unrecognized gain or loss in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the company currently has an unrecognized loss of million  of which a portion will be amortized into earnings in the effect on years beyond will depend substantially upon the actual experience of the plans 
disclosure of the significant assumptions used in arriving at the net pension expense is presented in the employee benefit plans note to consolidated financial statements 
a sensitivity analysis of projected net periodic pension expense to changes in key underlying assumptions for the company s primary plan  the us pension plan  is presented below 
impact on net assumed rate change pension expense discount rate million expected long term rate of return on assets million rate of increase in compensation levels million self insurance reserves management uses a variety of statistical and actuarial methods that are widely used and accepted in the insurance industry to estimate amounts for claims that have been reported but not paid and claims incurred but not reported 
in applying these methods and assessing their results  management considers such factors as frequency and severity of claims  claim development and payment patterns and changes in the nature of the company s business  among other factors 
such factors are analyzed for each of the company s business segments 
on an annual basis  third party actuaries perform a separate analysis of the company s self insurance reserves for reasonableness 
the company s estimates may be impacted by such factors as increases in the market price for medical services  unpredictability of the size of jury awards and limitations inherent in the estimation process 
while management believes that self insurance reserves are adequate  there can be no assurance that changes to management s estimates may not occur 
based on self insurance reserves at december   a percent adverse change in actuarial claim loss estimates would increase operating expense in by approximately million 
goodwill impairment the company assesses goodwill for impairment  as described in summary of significant accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets note to consolidated financial statements  on an annual basis or more often if deemed necessary 
to determine whether goodwill impairment indicators exist  the company is required to assess the fair value of the reporting unit and compare it to the carrying value 
a reporting unit is a component of an operating segment for which discrete financial information is available and management regularly reviews its operating performance 
the company s valuation of fair value for each reporting unit is determined based on a discounted future cash flow model 
estimates of future cash flows are dependent on management s knowledge and experience about past and current events and assumptions about conditions it expects to exist 
these assumptions are based on a number of factors including future operating performance  economic conditions and actions management expects to take 
while management believes its estimates of future cash flows are reasonable  there can be no assurance that a deterioration in economic conditions or adverse changes to expectations of future performance will not occur  resulting in a goodwill impairment loss 
at december   the total amount of goodwill was million 
income taxes the company records a valuation allowance for deferred income tax assets to reduce such assets to amounts expected to be realized 
in determining the required level of the valuation allowance  the company considers whether it is more likely than not that all or some portion of deferred tax assets will not be realized 
this assessment is based on management s expectations as to whether sufficient taxable income of an appropriate character will be realized within tax carryback and carryforward periods 
should the company change its estimate of the amount of its deferred tax assets that it would be able to realize  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would result in an increase or decrease to provision for income taxes in the period such a change in estimate was made 
at december   the deferred tax valuation allowance principally attributed to foreign tax loss carryforwards in the scs business segment was million 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which requires entities to record the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
when the liability is initially recorded  the company is required to capitalize a cost by increasing the carrying amount of the related long lived asset 
over time  the liability is accreted to its present value each period  and the capitalized cost is depreciated over the useful life of the related asset
