results of operations versus revenues for the year ended december  increased to million  an increase of million or from last year s revenues of million 
the company s foreign operations made up less than of the company s total revenues in and the revenue increase was mainly attributable to a modest increase in revenues from pest control services  as termite revenues were flat with the prior year 
the growth in pest control revenues reflects the beneficial impact of better customer retention and a successful residential summer sales program  factors that combined to produce a net gain in the customer base as well as higher average selling prices

every other month service  our primary residential pest control service offering  continues to grow in importance  comprising almost of our residential pest control customer base at year end 
our commercial revenues grew  mainly as a result of better pricing on new sales  a successful price increase campaign for existing customers in  and the introduction of new products and services during the year 
although termite revenues were flat in as a result of a decrease in sales to new customers  the company experienced an improvement in recurring revenues mainly from enhanced renewal retention and higher bait monitoring services 
despite the decrease in termite sales dollars  the company managed to achieve a slight improvement in average selling prices

better fleet management led to a decrease in the average number of vehicles and an improvement in revenues per vehicle 
sales  general and administrative for the year ended december  decreased million or  and improved by margin points in  averaging of total revenues compared to for the prior year 
improvement for the year was mainly attributed to reduced personnel related expenses  fleet expense  telephone expense  travel expense  bad debt expense and sales promotions partially offset by higher summer selling program expense and advertising expense 
depreciation and amortization expenses for the year ended december  were approximately million or higher than the prior year 
the increase was primarily due to the depreciation associated with focus  the company s new proprietary branch computer system 
the rollout of focus to the branches was completed in the fourth quarter of as a result of the adoption of sfas no 
 the amortization of goodwill has been discontinued as of january   causing a decrease in goodwill amortization expense of approximately million partially offset by an increase in amortization expense of million due to a change in the expected life of customer contracts 
net income for the year ended december  includes the effects of adopting sfas no 
 which did not have a material impact to the company s overall results of operations 
in addition  if sfas no 
had been adopted in the year ended december   it would not have had a material impact to net income previously reported for the year ended december  the company s net tax provision of million for the year ended december  reflects increased taxable income over the prior year

results of operations versus the increase in revenues for the year ended december  was primarily due to increased recurring revenues in both pest and termite control 
pest control benefited from improvement in customer retention and a solid increase in commercial revenues 
the increased recurring revenues from termite control can be mainly attributed to the impact of the termite baiting program 
orkin s directed liquid termite baiting program generates recurring monitoring revenues that are deferred to the balance sheet each month in the form of unearned revenue 
this is then being recognized in future periods when the service is rendered

critical accounting policies we view critical accounting policies to be those policies that are very important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations  and that require management s most difficult  complex or subjective judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult or complex relate to the need for management to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe our critical accounting policies to be as follows accrual for termite contracts the company maintains an accrual for termite contracts representing the estimated costs of reapplications  repair claims and associated labor  chemicals  and other costs relative to termite control services performed prior to the balance sheet date 
the company contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the company a range of estimated liability based upon historical claims information 
the actuarial study is a major consideration in determining the accrual balance along with management s knowledge of changes in business practices  contract changes  ongoing claims and termite remediation trends 
the reserve is established based on all these factors 
management makes judgments utilizing these operational factors but recognizes that they are inherently subjective due to the difficulty in predicting settlements and awards 
other factors that may impact future cost include chemical life expectancy and governmental regulation 
it is significant that the actual number of claims has decreased in recent years due to changes in the company s business practices 
however  it is not possible to accurately predict future significant claims 
positive changes to our business practices include revisions made to our contracts  more effective treatment methods that include a directed liquid baiting program  more effective termiticides  and expanded training methods and techniques 
accrued insurance the company self insures  up to specified limits  certain risks related to general liability  workers compensation and vehicle liability 
the estimated costs of existing and future claims under the self insurance program are accrued based upon historical trends as incidents occur  whether reported or unreported although actual settlement of the claims may not be made until future periods and may be subsequently revised based on developments relating to such claims 
the company contracts an independent third party actuary on an annual basis to provide the company a range of estimated liability based upon historical claims information 
the actuarial study is a major consideration  along with management s knowledge of changes in business practice and existing claims compared to current balances 
the reserve is established based on all these factors 
management s judgment is inherently subjective and a number of factors are outside management s knowledge and control 
additionally  historical information is not always an accurate indication of future events 
it should be noted that the number of claims has been decreasing due to the company s proactive risk management to develop and maintain ongoing programs 
however  it is not possible to accurately predict future significant claims 
initiatives that have been implemented  include pre employment and an annual motor vehicle report required on all its drivers  utilization of a global positioning system that has been fully deployed to our company vehicles  post offer physicals for new employees  and pre hire  random and post accident drug testing 
the company has improved the time required to report a claim by utilizing a red alert program that provides serious accident assessment twenty four hours a day and seven days a week and has instituted a modified duty program that enables employees to go back to work on a limited duty basis 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policies are designed to recognize revenues at the time services are performed 
for certain revenue types  because of the timing of billing and the receipt of cash versus the timing of performing services  certain accounting estimates are utilized 
residential and commercial pest control services are primarily recurring in nature  while certain types of commercial customers may receive multiple treatments within a given month 
in general  pest control customers sign an initial one year contract  and revenues are recognized at the time services are performed 
for pest control customers  the company offers a discount for those customers who prepay for a full year of services 
the company defers recognition of these advance payments and recognizes the revenue as the services are rendered 
the company classifies the discounts related to the advance payments as a reduction in revenues 
termite baiting revenues are recognized when the initial services are performed at the inception of a new contract  although a portion of every termite baiting sale is deferred 
the amount deferred is an estimate of the value of monitoring services to be rendered after the initial service 
the amount deferred is then recognized as income on a straight line basis over the remaining contract term  which results in recognition of revenue in a pattern that approximates the timing of performing monitoring visits 
baiting renewals are deferred and recognized over the annual contract period on a straight line basis that approximates the timing of performing the required monitoring visits 
traditional termite treatments are recognized as revenue at the time services are performed 
traditional termite contract renewals are recognized as revenues at the renewal date in order to match the revenue with the approximate timing of the corresponding service provided 
liquidity and capital resources the company believes its current cash balances  future cash flows from operating activities and available borrowings under its million line of credit will be sufficient to finance its current operations and obligations  and fund expansion of the business for the foreseeable future 
the company s operations generated cash of million for the year ended december   compared with cash provided by operating activities of million in and million in the increase resulted primarily from favorable changes in working capital related primarily to higher net income from operations  the timing of advanced payments from customers which produced an increase in unearned revenue  and the company s ability to reduce its investment in accounts receivable and inventories despite higher revenues
