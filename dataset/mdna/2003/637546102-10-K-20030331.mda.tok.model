item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following analysis of the consolidated results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
results of operations consolidated results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net income for the national security group the company was  in compared to million in on a per share basis earnings were in compared to in realized capital gains were million in compared to million in consolidated revenues were million in compared to million in increased insurance premium production in the property casualty insurance subsidiaries was the primary factor contributing to the increase in revenues in however  adverse underwriting results in the property casualty insurance segment were the primary factor contributing to the decline in earnings for compared to a owned subsidiary contributed  to net income in this subsidiary  the mobile attic  inc  is in the business of leasing portable storage containers through independent dealers in alabama  florida  and tennessee 
the operating results of the subsidiaries are discussed in further detail in the sections that follow 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  consolidated net income for the national security group the company was million in compared to million in on a per share basis earnings were in compared to in a second consecutive year of underwriting profits in the property casualty insurance subsidiaries boosted earnings to the highest levels in more than a decade 
realized capital gains in were million and million in consolidated revenues were million in compared to million in industry segment data certain financial information for the national security group s three segments life and accident and health insurance  property and casualty insurance  and other is summarized as follows amounts in thousands premium revenues life  accident and health insurance   property and casualty insurance   income before taxes and equity in income of affiliate life  accident and health insurance  property and casualty insurance  other interest expense life and accident and health insurance operations the company s life  accident and health insurance business is conducted through national security insurance company nsic  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in year ended december  compared to year ended december  income before income taxes in was  compared to  in a decrease in litigation related expenses boosted income before income tax by over  a decline in general expenses is the other significant item contributing to the increase in income before income taxes in compared to premium revenue increased to  in compared to  in  an increase of 
insurance sales through independent agent distribution channels increased over in over prior year  while sales through nsic s traditional home service distribution channel declined by 
while management is pleased with new business production from the independent agents distribution channel  an increased focus is now being placed on increasing retention of new business 
increased retention and persistency will not only further increase premium growth in the independent agent distribution channel  but also reduce commission expense as a percent of premium because most commission paid on an insurance contract sold through independent agents is paid in the first two years the policy is in force 
commission expense increased in compared to the continuing increases in new sales through independent agents and a change in the home service agents commission contract were the primary factors contributing to the increase in commission 
independent agents typically receive much higher commission rates in the early years of a policy compared to employee agents in the home service market  which typically receive a lower and more level commission over a longer number of years 
with premium growth generated exclusively through independent agents  commission expense will rise at a faster rate than premium growth until a more significant block of insurance business rolls into subsequent years at lower commission rates 
the second factor contributing to the increase in commission expense was a change in employee home service agents contract in under the new contract agents received an increase in base salary and could achieve bonuses upon obtaining varying levels of persistency 
to offset the increase in salaries  management reduced the number of agents and combined sales territories 
because the salary increases were implemented early in and efficiency efforts were not fully implemented until later in  no cost savings were realized and in fact total field cost in the home service program increased 
however  as a result of these efforts  home service field cost are expected to stabilize in and subsequent years 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  income before income taxes in was  compared to  in increased field cost and general expenses and a decrease in realized capital gains were the primary factors contributing to the decrease in income in the life insurance subsidiary 
nsic increased premium income to  in compared to  in life insurance premium income increased in  and accident and health insurance also had an increase of in the life insurance sales through independent agents were the source of premium growth in nsic in commission expenses increased due to the continued increase in new business production 
life insurance commissions are front loaded  meaning that significantly higher commission rates are paid in the early years of a policy and decrease significantly particularly after the first two years of the policy 
property casualty operations the company s property and casualty insurance business is conducted through national security fire casualty company nsfc  a wholly owned subsidiary of the company organized in  and omega one insurance company omega  a wholly owned subsidiary of national security fire casualty company organized in year ended december  compared to year ended december  property and casualty premium revenues increased  for the year ended december  compared to the same period in  an increase of over 
increased marketing efforts certainly had a significant impact on the increase in premium revenue  but market changes also significantly influenced the influx of new business 
over the last two years many companies have become much more restrictive in their underwriting guidelines  or have completely exited some markets that we serve 
as a result of these market changes we have seen a decrease in competition and an opportunity to significantly increase market share 
however  as will be discussed in the paragraphs that follow  we will have to strictly monitor underwriting results and proactively manage growth in order to improve underwriting profitability 
net income before income tax was  in compared to  in adverse claims experience from hurricane losses in the fourth quarter of and an increased severity of losses on new business issued were the primary reasons for the significant decrease in income 
in october of hurricane lili swept across louisiana causing over  in insured losses in nsfc and omega 
however  the most significant impact on property casualty net income for the year was poor underwriting results on new business issued 
historically  new property insurance business issued has carried a higher loss ratio than renewal business 
in the property casualty subsidiaries issued more new business than has been issued in recent history with an increase in premium revenue of over 
nsfc incurred numerous total losses on business in force less than one year  mostly fire losses 
of all dwelling property losses incurred in were attributable to fire losses of over  per occurrence 
historically  fire losses are more numerous in the winter months of december and january  but a higher frequency of fire losses was experienced throughout the year 
it is difficult to prove that these higher frequency losses were connected to any single cause  such as a colder than normal winter or lightning strikes  but with the overall economy in a downturn and personal bankruptcy at record highs in some of the states in which nsfc and omega writes business  management believes that at least some of the losses could be attributable to arson  which is most cases is virtually impossible to prove 
in an effort to stem the frequency of total fire losses  we have instituted additional underwriting standards in some states  such as providing proof of prior insurance coverage and closer evaluation of prior claims history 
we will closely monitor underwriting results in and make further improvements and adjustments as deemed necessary to improve underwriting profitability 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income before income tax was  in compared to  in improved underwriting results continued to be the primary factor contributing to the improvement in income before taxes 
earned premium for was  compared to  in the property casualty subsidiaries experienced premium growth in dwelling fire  homeowners  and private passenger auto lines of business 
the improved underwriting results in compared to were primarily attributable to the completion of the runoff period for several general agent programs that were started through out the s 
adverse loss development on these programs led to higher underwriting losses in the late s 
these programs  primarily commercial and private passenger auto programs  were discontinued in and property casualty combined ratio a measure used to analyze a property casualty insurer s underwriting performance is the statutory combined ratio 
it is the sum of two ratios a 
the loss and loss expense ratio  which measures losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred as a percentage of premiums earned 
b 
the underwriting expense ratio  which measures underwriting expenses incurred eg  agents commissions  premium taxes  and other administrative underwriting expenses as a percentage of premiums written during the year 
the results of these ratios for the past three years were loss and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio maintaining a combined ratio below  which indicates that the company is making an underwriting profit  depends upon many factors including hurricane activity in the gulf of mexico and the southern atlantic coast  strict underwriting of risks  and adequate and timely premium rates 
a major hurricane hitting the coast of alabama  georgia  south carolina  mississippi  louisiana  or texas could cause the combined ratio to fluctuate materially from prior years 
the property and casualty subsidiaries maintain catastrophe reinsurance to minimize the effect of a major catastrophe 
the combined ratio for compared to increased seventeen percentage points 
the loss and lae component of the combined ratio increased over twenty percentage points 
the previously discussed hurricane related losses and a higher loss ratio on new business is the primary reason for the significant increase in the combined ratio 
on a positive note  the expense ratio declined over four percentage points in compared to while the large influx of new business had an adverse impact on the loss and lae ratio  the increase in new business did enable us to begin to achieve some economies of scale and reduce the expense ratio significantly 
a primary objective for us in will be to focus on maintaining a manageable level of growth while reducing the loss and lae ratio 
as discussed earlier in the property and casualty operations section of this report  we are proactively managing our risk to mitigate the continuing negative impact of adverse underwriting results on the company 
leasing operations the company s leasing operations are conducted through its owned subsidiary  mobile attic  inc the investment in mobile attic is accounted for under the equity method in the consolidated financial statements of the company 
mobile attic was incorporated in august of and is a joint venture with a manufacturing partner  cash brothers leasing of elba  alabama 
mobile attic is in the business of leasing portable storage containers to individual and commercial customers through an independent dealer network primarily in alabama  but also operating in florida and tennessee 
at december  mobile attic had available approximately  storage containers for lease and thirteen independent dealers 
the portable storage containers are eight feet wide and eight feet tall and are available in lengths of    and feet 
independent dealers market these portable storage containers primarily to household customers in need of a convenient alternative to fixed location mini storage  commercial customers in need of secure storage facilities at job sites  and retail customers for storage of seasonal inventory 
in mobile attic contributed  in net income to the company compared to net income of  in in  the year in which operations began  gross rental revenues were  in gross rental revenues were  it is anticipated that mobile attic will produce rental revenue of over  in with over  storage containers available for lease by year end asset portfolio review the life insurance and property casualty subsidiaries primarily invest in highly liquid investment grade debt and equity securities 
at december   the company s holdings in debt securities amounted to of total investments and of total assets 
the following is a breakdown of the bond portfolio quality according to national association of insurance commissioners naic securities valuation office svo rating standards  and the nationally recognized rating organization equivalents of moody s and standard and poor s svo equivalents of total svo class moody s standards and poor s bond portfolio aaa to a aaa to a baa to baa bbb to bbb ba to ba bb to bb b to b b to b caa to ca ccc to c c ci to d as of january   the company adopted financial accounting standards board statement and reclassified a portion of its fixed maturity securities portfolio as available for sale  with the remainder being classified as held to maturity 
with that reclassification  the fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale are carried at fair value and changes in fair values  net of related income taxes  are charged or credited to shareholders equity see note e to the consolidated financial statements 
the insurance subsidiaries fixed maturity securities include mortgage backed bonds  primarily collateralized mortgage obligations cmo s  of million and million at december  and respectively 
the mortgage backed bonds are subject to risks associated with variable prepayments of the underlying mortgage loans 
prepayments cause those securities to have different actual maturities than that expected at the time of purchase 
securities that are purchased at a premium to par value and prepay faster than expected will incur a reduction in yield or loss 
securities that are purchased at a discount to par value and prepay faster than expected will generate an increase in yield or gain 
the degree to which a security is susceptible to either gains or losses is influenced by the difference between amortized cost and par value  the relative sensitivity of the underlying mortgages backing the assets to prepayments in a changing interest rate environment and the repayment priority of the securities in the overall securitization structure 
liquidity and capital resources due to regulatory restrictions  the majority of the company s cash is required to be invested in investment grade securities to provide ample protection for policyholders 
the liabilities of the insurance subsidiaries are of various terms and  therefore  those subsidiaries invest in securities with various maturities spread over periods usually not exceeding years 
the liquidity requirements for the company are primarily met by funds generated from operations of the life insurance and property casualty insurance subsidiaries 
premium and investment income as well as maturities and sales of invested assets provide the primary sources of cash for both the life and property casualty businesses  while applications of cash are applied by both businesses to the payment of policy benefits  the cost of acquiring new business principally commissions  operating expenses  purchases of new investment  and in the case of life insurance  policy loans 
the national security group s consolidated statement of cash flows indicate that operating activities provided used cash of    in   and respectively 
those statements also classify the other sources and uses of cash by investing activities  and financing activities and disclose the amount of cash available at the end of the year to meet the company s obligations 
the company has standby letters of credit of less than  these letters are used to guarantee obligations of the property casualty subsidiary under assumed reinsurance contracts 
certain invested assets of the company secure the letters of credit 
the company also routinely incurs liability for declared but unpaid dividends 
long term liquidity needs of the company constitute only those items  which are directly related to the principal business operations of the company 
the company has notes payable of million at december  the notes payable are to be repaid in quarterly installments over five years 
the ability of the company to meet its commitments for timely payment of claims and other expenses depends  in addition to current cash flow  on the liquidity of its investments 
on december   the company had no known impairments of assets or changes in operation  which would have a material adverse effect upon liquidity 
approximately of the company s assets are invested in cash  investment grade fixed income securities  short term investments and broadly traded equity securities which are highly liquid 
the values of these investments are subject to the conditions of the markets in which they are traded 
past fluctuations in these markets have had little effect on the liquidity of the company 
the company has relatively little exposure to lower grade fixed income investments which might be especially subject to liquidity problems due to thinly traded markets 
except as discussed in note p to the consolidated financial statements  the company is aware of no known trends  events  or uncertainties reasonably likely to have a material effect on its liquidity  capital resources  or operations 
additionally  the company has not been made aware of any recommendations of regulatory authorities  which if implemented  would have such an effect 
as disclosed in note m to the consolidated financial statements  in  the amount that the national security group s insurance subsidiaries can transfer in the form of dividends to the parent company is limited to million in the life insurance subsidiary and million in the property casualty insurance subsidiary 
however  that condition poses no short term or long term liquidity concerns for the parent company 
statutory risk based capital of insurance subsidiaries the naic has adopted risk based capital rbc requirements for life health and property casualty insurance companies to evaluate the adequacy of statutory capital and surplus in relation to investment and insurance risks such as asset quality  mortality and morbidity  asset and liability matching  benefit and loss reserve adequacy  and other business factors 
state insurance regulators will use the rbc formula as an early warning tool to identify  for the purpose of initiating regulatory action  insurance companies that potentially are inadequately capitalized 
in addition  the formula defines new minimum capital standards that will supplement the current system of low fixed minimum capital and surplus requirements on a state by state basis 
regulatory compliance is determined by a ratio of the company s regulatory total adjusted capital  as defined by the naic  to its authorized control level rbc  as defined by the naic 
companies below specific trigger points or ratios are classified within levels  each of which requires corrective action 
the levels and ratios are as follows regulatory event ratio of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc less than or equal to company action level regulatory action level authorized control level mandatory control level the ratios of total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc for the national security group s life health and property casualty insurance subsidiaries are all in excess of five to one at december  national security insurance company life insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security insurance company meets the minimum rbc requirements 
national security fire casualty company property casualty insurer has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  national security fire casualty company meets the minimum rbc requirements 
omega one insurance company property casualty insurer  which began writing business in late  has regulatory adjusted capital of million and million at december  and  respectively  and a ratio of regulatory total adjusted capital to authorized control level rbc of and at december  and respectively 
accordingly  omega one insurance company meets the minimum rbc requirements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s primary objectives in managing its investment portfolio are to maximize investment income and total investment returns while minimizing overall credit risk 
investment strategies are developed based on many factors including changes in interest rates  overall market conditions  underwriting results  regulatory requirements  and tax position 
investment decisions are made by management and reviewed and approved by the board of directors 
market risk represents the potential for loss due to adverse changes in fair value of securities 
the three potential risks related to the company s fixed maturity portfolio are interest rate risk  prepayment risk  and default risk 
the primary risk related to the company s equity portfolio is equity price risk since the company s assets and liabilities are largely monetary in nature  the company s financial position and earnings are subject to risks resulting from changes in interest rates at varying maturities  changes in spreads over us treasuries on new investment opportunities  changes in the yield curve and equity pricing risks 
the company is exposed to equity price risk on its equity securities 
the company holds common stock with a fair value of million 
if the market value of the s p index decreased from its december  value  the fair value of the company s common stock would decrease by approximately million 
certain fixed interest rate market risk sensitive instruments may not give rise to incremental income or loss during the period illustrated but may be subject to changes in fair values 
note a in the consolidated financial statements presents additional disclosures concerning fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities  and is incorporated by reference herein 
the company limits the extent of its market risk by purchasing securities that are backed by stable collateral  the majority of the assets are issued by us government sponsored entities 
also  the majority of all of the subsidiaries cmo s are planned amortization class pac bonds 
pac bonds are typically the lowest risk cmo s  and provide greater cash flow predictability 
such securities with reduced risk typically have a lower yield  but higher liquidity  than higher risk mortgage backed bonds 
to reduce the risk of loss of principal should prepayments exceed expectations  the company does not purchase mortgage backed securities at significant premiums over par value 
the company s investment approach in the equity markets is based primarily on a fundamental analysis of value 
this approach requires the investment committee to invest in well managed  primarily dividend paying companies  which have a low debt to capital ratio  above average return on net worth for a sustained period of time  and low price to book value or low volatility rating beta relative to the market 
the dividends provide a steady cash flow to help pay current claim liabilities  and it has been the company s experience that by following this investment strategy  long term investment results have been superior to those offered by bonds  while keeping the risk of loss of capital to a minimum relative to the overall equity market
