item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of the company should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
this management s discussion and analysis section and other parts of this annual report on form k contain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  as well as assumptions that  if they never materialize or prove incorrect  could cause the results of the company to differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
all statements other than statements of historical fact are statements that could be deemed forward looking statements  including any projections of earnings  revenues or other financial items  any statements of the plans  strategies and objectives of management for future operations  any statements concerning proposed new products  services or developments  any statements regarding future economic conditions or performance  any statements of belief  and any statement of assumptions underlying any of the foregoing 
the risks  uncertainties and assumptions referred to above include the ability of the company to retain and motivate key employees  the timely development  production and acceptance of products and services and their feature sets  the challenge of managing asset levels  including inventory  the flow of products into third party distribution channels  marketing efforts  levels of competition  the difficulty of keeping expense growth at modest levels while increasing revenues  operating and capital requirements  and other risks that are described from time to time in the company s securities and exchange commission reports  including but not limited to this annual report on form k for the fiscal year ended may  and subsequently filed reports 
the company assumes no obligation and does not intend to update these forward looking statements 
overview the company was founded in to develop and manufacture burn in and test equipment for the semiconductor industry 
since its inception  the company has sold more than  systems to semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor contract assemblers and burn in and test service companies worldwide 
the company s principal products currently are the mtx massively parallel test system  the max and atx burn in systems  the fox full wafer contact burn in and parallel test system  the diepak carrier and test fixtures 
the company s net sales consist primarily of sales of systems  die carriers  test fixtures  upgrades and spare parts and revenues from service contracts 
the company s selling arrangements may include contractual customer acceptance provisions and installation of the product occurs after shipment and transfer of title 
as a result  effective june   to comply with the provisions of sab  the company recognizes revenue upon shipment and defers recognition of revenue for any amounts subject to acceptance until such acceptance occurs 
the amount of revenue deferred is the greater of the fair value of the undelivered element or the contractual agreed to amounts 
prior to june   revenue for all products except royalties was recognized upon shipment of product provided no significant obligations remained and collectibility was assured 
provisions for the estimated future cost of warranty and installation are recorded at the time the products are shipped 
a substantial portion of the company s net sales is derived from the sale of products for overseas markets 
consequently  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the cost of the company s products compared to products sold by local companies in such markets 
although most sales to european customers are denominated in us dollars  substantially all sales to japanese customers are denominated in yen 
since the price is determined at the time a purchase order is accepted  the company is exposed to the risks of fluctuations in the yen us dollar exchange rate during the lengthy period from purchase order to ultimate payment 
the length of time between receipt of order and ultimate payment typically ranges from six to twelve months 
the exchange rate risk is partially offset to the extent the company s japanese subsidiary incurs expenses payable in yen 
to date  the company has not invested in instruments designed to hedge currency risks  but it may do so in the future 
the company s japanese subsidiary typically carries debt or other obligations due to the company that may be denominated in either yen or us dollars 
since the financial statements of the japanese subsidiary are based in yen and the company s financial statements are based in us dollars  the japanese subsidiary and the company recognize income or loss in any period in which the value of the yen rises or falls in relation to the us dollar 
in accordance with sfas  the company capitalizes its systems software development costs incurred after a system achieves technological feasibility and before first commercial shipment 
such costs typically represent a small portion of total research and development costs 
no system software development costs were capitalized or amortized in fiscal  and critical accounting policies the company s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to customer programs and incentives  product returns  bad debts  inventories  investments  intangible assets  income taxes  financing operations  warranty obligations  long term service contracts  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component of the results of operations 
the company s revenue consists primarily of sales of systems  die carriers  test fixtures  upgrades and spare parts and revenues from service contracts 
the company recognizes revenue upon shipment and defers recognition of revenue for any amounts subject to acceptance until such acceptance occurs 
the amount of revenue deferred is the greater of the fair value of the undelivered element or the contractual agreed to amounts 
royalty revenue related to licensing income from ptbs is recognized when paid by the licensee 
this income is recorded in net sales 
in addition  the company s revenue recognition determines the timing of certain expenses  such as commissions and royalties 
the company follows very specific and detailed guidelines in measuring revenue in accordance with sab  however  certain judgments affect the application of the revenue policy 
revenue results are difficult to predict  and any shortfall in revenue or delay in recognizing revenue could cause the operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter and could result in future operating losses 
the company s revenue recognition policy is further affected by estimated reductions to revenue for special pricing agreements  price protection  promotions and other volume based incentives 
if market conditions decline  the company may take actions to increase customer incentive offerings possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue or increase in cost at the time the incentive is offered 
the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial conditions of the company s customers deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
warranty obligations the company provides for records the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
while the company engages in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of its component suppliers  the company s warranty obligation is affected by product failure rates  material usage and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
the company s estimate of warranty reserve is based on management assessment of future warranty obligations and on historical warranty obligations 
should actual product failure rates  material usage or service delivery costs differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
inventory obsolescence the company writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
the company records an investment impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while the company has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event the company determines that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination is made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination is made

income tax benefit was  in the fiscal year ended may   compared with income tax expense of million in the fiscal year ended may  the income tax benefit in the fiscal year ended may  was primarily related to foreign operations 
the income tax expense in the fiscal year ended may  was primarily due to a non cash charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal associated with recording a full valuation allowance against the company s deferred tax assets 
sfas requires the company to evaluate the uncertainty of utilizing the deferred tax assets 
the company s effective income tax rate did not approximate the statutory tax rates of the jurisdictions in which the company operates primarily because no tax benefit is being recorded for losses in the company s us operation and its japanese subsidiary 
fiscal year ended may  compared to fiscal year ended may  net sales 
net sales decreased to million in the fiscal year ended may  from million in the fiscal year ended may   a decrease of

research and development cost reimbursement darpa 
r d darpa in  the company entered into a cost sharing agreement with darpa  a us government agency  under which darpa provided co funding for the development of wafer level burn in and test equipment 
the contract provided for potential payments by darpa totaling up to million 
the agreement provided that i the company shall retain title to all co funded inventions  ii darpa will receive a paid up license to use the inventions for government purposes and iii darpa can require the company to license the inventions to third parties on reasonable terms if the company fails to adequately commercialize the inventions 
darpa payments are reflected as credits to research and development expenses 
r d darpa is a credit representing reimbursements by darpa of costs incurred in the company s wafer level burn in development project 
there was no r d darpa in the fiscal year ended may   compared to  in the fiscal year ended may  payments by darpa depended on satisfaction of development milestones  and the level of payments varied significantly from fiscal year to fiscal year 
the two final milestones of this agreement were approved and paid during fiscal it is not expected that there will be any additional r d darpa credits recorded for this project after fiscal interest income 
interest income decreased to  in the fiscal year ended may  from  in the fiscal year ended may   a decrease of 
the decrease in interest income was primarily related to a lower average rate of return on investments and a lower level of cash and investments 
interest expense 
there was no interest expense in the fiscal year ended may   compared with interest expense of  in the fiscal year ended may   primarily the result of the full repayment of outstanding debt in the fourth quarter of fiscal other income expense  net 
other expense  net was  in the fiscal year ended may   compared with other income  net of  in the fiscal year ended may  the decrease in other income expense  net was primarily due to the recognition of less income recorded in the fiscal year ended may  related to the company s interest in esa electronics pte ltd 
income tax expense benefit 
income tax expense was million in the fiscal year ended may   compared with income tax expense of million in the fiscal year ended may  the income tax expense in the fiscal year ended may  was primarily due to the non cash charge of million recorded in the fourth quarter associated with increasing the valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
sfas requires the company to evaluate the uncertainty of utilizing the deferred tax assets 
the income tax expense in the fiscal year ended may  was primarily due to the tax expense recorded as a result of income earned in the company s us operations 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity has been generated from the company s august initial public offering  which resulted in net proceeds to the company of approximately million 
as of may   the company had million in cash and short term investments 
net cash used in operating activities was approximately million for the fiscal year ended may  and  for the fiscal year ended may  for the fiscal year ended may   net cash used in operating activities was due primarily to the net loss of million  partially offset by a decrease in other current assets of  due primarily from income taxes refunded 
for the fiscal year ended may   net cash used in operating activities was primarily due to the net loss of million  partially offset by a decrease in accounts receivable of million and adjustments for non cash charges 
net cash provided by investing activities was approximately million for the fiscal year ended may  and net cash used in investing activities was approximately million for the fiscal year ended may  net cash provided by investing activities during the fiscal year ended may  was primarily due to the sale of short term investments of million  partially offset by the purchase of long term investments of  net cash used in investing activities for the fiscal year ended may  was primarily due to the purchase of short term investments of million  partially offset by the sale of long term investments of million and additions to property and equipment of  financing activities used cash of approximately  in the fiscal year ended may  and provided cash of approximately  in the fiscal year ended may  net cash used in financing activities during the fiscal year ended may  was primarily due to the company s repurchase of  of its outstanding common shares at an average price of  partially offset by proceeds from issuance of common stock and exercise of stock options 
net cash provided by financing activities for the fiscal year ended may  was primarily due to proceeds from issuance of common stock and exercise of stock options 
as of may   the company had working capital of million  compared with million as of may  working capital consists of cash and cash equivalents  short term investments  accounts receivable  inventory and other current assets  less current liabilities 
the company announced in august that its board of directors had authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of its outstanding common shares 
the company may repurchase the shares in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  from time to time  subject to market conditions 
the number of shares of common stock actually acquired by the company will depend on subsequent developments and corporate needs  and the repurchase program may be interrupted or discontinued at any time 
any such repurchase of shares  if consummated  may use a portion of the company s working capital 
as of may   the company had repurchased  shares at an average price of

the company leases most of its manufacturing and office space under operating leases 
the company entered into a non cancelable operating lease agreement for its united states manufacturing and office facilities  which commenced in december and expires in december under the lease agreement  the company is responsible for payments of utilities  taxes and insurance 
minimum annual rentals payments under operating leases in each of the next five fiscal years and thereafter are as follows in thousands payments due by period total thereafter operating leases   from time to time  the company evaluates potential acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies that complement the company s business 
any such transactions  if consummated  may use a portion of the company s working capital or require the issuance of equity 
the company has no present understandings  commitments or agreements with respect to any material acquisitions 
the company anticipates that the existing cash balance together with cash provided by operations  if any  are adequate to meet its working capital and capital equipment requirements through calendar year after calendar year  depending on its rate of growth and profitability  the company may require additional equity or debt financing to meet its working capital requirements or capital equipment needs 
there can be no assurance that additional financing will be available when required  or if available  that such financing can be obtained on terms satisfactory to the company

factors that may affect future results of operations you should carefully consider the risks described below before making an investment decision 
the company believes that the risks and uncertainties described below are the principal material risks facing aehr test as of the date of this form k 
in the future  the company may become subject to additional risks that are not currently known to the company 
if any of the following risks actually occur  the company s business  financial condition and operating results could be seriously harmed 
as a result  the trading price of the company s common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of the value of your investment 
fluctuations in operating results 
the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience significant fluctuations in its quarterly and annual operating results 
during fiscal  and  quarterly net sales have been as low as million and as high as million  and gross margins for quarterly sales have fluctuated between and 
the company s future operating results will depend upon a variety of factors  including sales volume  the timing of significant orders  the mix of products sold  changes in pricing by the company  its competitors  customers or suppliers  the length of sales cycles for the company s products  timing of new product announcements and releases by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new products and enhanced versions of the company s products  capital spending patterns by customers  manufacturing inefficiencies associated with new product introductions by the company  the company s ability to produce systems and products in volume and meet customer requirements  product returns and customer acceptance of product shipments  volatility in the company s targeted markets  political and economic instability  natural disasters  regulatory changes  possible disruptions caused by expanding existing facilities or moving into new facilities  expenses associated with acquisitions and alliances  and various competitive factors  including price based competition  competition from vendors employing other technologies  and the amount of products sold under volume purchase arrangements  which tend to have lower selling prices 
accordingly  past performance may not be indicative of future performance 
dependence on timing and size of sales orders and shipment 
the company derives a substantial portion of its revenues from the sale of a relatively small number of systems which typically range in purchase price from approximately  to over  as a result  the loss or deferral of a limited number of system sales could have a material adverse effect on the company s net sales and operating results in a particular period 
all customer purchase orders are subject to cancellation or rescheduling by the customer with limited penalties  and  therefore  backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
from time to time  cancellations and rescheduling of customer orders have occurred  and delays by the company s suppliers in providing components or subassemblies to the company have caused delays in the company s shipments of its own products 
there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected by future cancellations and rescheduling 
a substantial portion of net sales typically are realized near the end of each quarter 
a delay or reduction in shipments near the end of a particular quarter  due  for example  to unanticipated shipment rescheduling  cancellations or deferrals by customers  customer credit issues  unexpected manufacturing difficulties experienced by the company  or delays in deliveries by suppliers  could cause net sales in a particular quarter to fall significantly below the company s expectations 
as the company incurs expenses in anticipation of future sales levels  the company s results of operations may be adversely affected if such sales levels are not achieved 
recent operating losses 
the company incurred loss from operations of million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the company reported operating income in fiscal and from fiscal to  due to increased net sales that were substantially the result of sales of new products  particularly sales of mtx systems 
in fiscal  the company began to feel an industry slowdown due to uncertainties caused primarily by the financial crisis in asia and dram overcapacity and therefore  recorded operating losses in fiscal and beginning in the second half of fiscal  the company experienced the result of a sharp and severe industry downturn and recorded operating losses in fiscal and there can be no assurance that the company s net sales and operating results will not continue to be further impacted by this prolonged downturn in the semiconductor equipment market and global economy 
failure to become profitable may depress the market price of the company s common stock and its ability to raise capital  if necessary 
dependence on market acceptance of fox system 
one element of the company s business strategy is to capture an increasing share of the test equipment market through sales of its fox wafer level burn in and test system 
the fox system is newly designed to simultaneously burn in and functionally test all of the die on a wafer 
the market for the fox systems is in the very early stages of development 
the fox system was introduced in july the company s strategy depends  in part  upon its ability to persuade potential customers that the fox system can successfully contact and functionally test all of the die on a wafer simultaneously  and that this method of testing is cost effective for the customer 
there can be no assurance that the company s strategy will be successful 
the failure of the fox system to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s future operating results and long term prospects 
the company s stock price may also decline 
market acceptance of the fox system is subject to a number of risks 
the company must complete development of the fox system and the manufacturing processes used to build it 
before a customer will incorporate the fox system in a production line  lengthy qualification and correlation tests must be performed 
the company anticipates that potential customers may be reluctant to change their procedures in order to transfer burn in and test functions to the fox system 
initial purchases are expected to be limited to systems used for these qualifications and for engineering studies 
market acceptance of the fox system also may be affected by a reluctance of ic manufacturers to rely on relatively small suppliers such as the company 
as is common with new complex products incorporating leading edge technologies  the company may encounter reliability  design and manufacturing issues as it begins volume production and initial installations of fox systems at customer sites 
while the company places a high priority on addressing these issues as they arise  there can be no assurance that they can be resolved to the customer s satisfaction or that the resolution of such problems will not cause the company to incur significant development costs or warranty expenses or to lose significant sales opportunities 
dependence on market acceptance of mtx system 
a principal element of the company s business strategy is to capture an increasing share of the memory test equipment market through sales of the mtx massively parallel test system 
the mtx is designed to perform both burn in and many of the final test functions currently performed by high cost memory testers 
the company s strategy depends  in part  upon its ability to persuade potential customers that the mtx system can successfully perform a significant portion of such final test functions and that transferring such tests to mtx systems will reduce their overall capital and test costs 
there can be no assurance that the company s strategy will be successful 
the failure of the mtx system to achieve market acceptance would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
market acceptance of the mtx system is subject to a number of risks 
through the end of fiscal  several companies purchased evaluation units of the mtx system  but only three customers have purchased production quantities 
there are no long term volume purchase commitments with any of these customers 
there can be no assurance that these customers will continue to purchase mtx systems for their production facilities 
since most potential customers have successfully relied on memory testers for many years and their personnel understand the use and maintenance of such systems  the company anticipates that they may be reluctant to change their procedures in order to transfer test functions to the mtx system 
before a customer will transfer test functions to the mtx  the test programs must be translated for use with the mtx system and lengthy correlation tests must be performed 
correlation testing may take up to six months or more 
furthermore  mtx system sales are expected to be primarily limited to new facilities and to existing facilities being upgraded to accommodate new product generations  such as the transition to new memory technologies  including the double data rate drams and ddr ii drams 
construction of new facilities and upgrades of existing facilities have in some cases been delayed or canceled during this semiconductor industry downturn 
other companies have purchased mtx systems which are being used only in quality assurance and engineering applications 
market acceptance of the mtx system may also be affected by a reluctance of ic manufacturers to rely on relatively small suppliers such as the company 
the company s future sales and operating results are also partially dependent on sales of performance test boards for use with the mtx system 
sales of ptbs by the company and its licensees will depend upon the number of mtx systems operated by customers 
customer concentration 
the semiconductor manufacturing industry is highly concentrated  with a relatively small number of large semiconductor manufacturers and contract assemblers accounting for a substantial portion of the purchases of semiconductor equipment 
sales to the company s five largest customers accounted for approximately  and of its net sales in fiscal  and  respectively 
during fiscal  texas instruments incorporated and first international computer  inc accounted for and of the company s net sales  respectively 
during fiscal  texas instruments incorporated  formosa advanced technologies co 
ltd 
and ase test  inc accounted for  and of the company s net sales  respectively 
during fiscal  texas instruments incorporated and formosa advanced technologies co 
ltd 
accounted for and of the company s net sales  respectively 
no other customers represented more than of the company s net sales for any of such periods 
the company expects that sales of its products to a limited number of customers will continue to account for a high percentage of net sales for the foreseeable future 
in addition  sales to particular customers may fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter 
the loss of or reduction or delay in orders from a significant customer  or a delay in collecting or failure to collect accounts receivable from a significant customer could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
limited market for burn in systems 
historically  a substantial portion of the company s net sales were derived from the sale of dynamic burn in systems 
the market for burn in systems is mature and estimated to be approximately million per year 
in general  process control improvements in the semiconductor industry have tended to reduce burn in times 
in addition  as a given ic product generation matures and yields increase  the required burn in time may be reduced or eliminated 
ic manufacturers  which historically have been the company s primary customer base  increasingly outsource test and burn in to independent test labs which often build their own systems 
there can be no assurance that the market for burn in systems will grow  and sales of the company s burn in products could decline 
lengthy sales cycle 
sales of the company s systems depend  in significant part  upon the decision of a prospective customer to increase manufacturing capacity or to restructure current manufacturing facilities  either of which typically involve a significant commitment of capital 
in addition  the approval process for mtx and fox system and diepak carrier sales may require lengthy qualification and correlation testing 
in view of the significant investment or strategic issues that may be involved in a decision to purchase mtx and fox systems or diepak carriers  the company may experience delays following initial qualification of the company s systems as a result of delays in a customer s approval process 

for these reasons  the company s systems typically have a lengthy sales cycle during which the company may expend substantial funds and management effort in securing a sale 
lengthy sales cycles subject the company to a number of significant risks  including inventory obsolescence and fluctuations in operating results  over which the company has little or no control 
the loss of individual orders due to the lengthy sales and evaluation cycle  or delays in the sale of even a limited number of systems could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition and  in particular  could contribute to significant fluctuations in operating results on a quarterly basis 
dependence on international sales and operations 
approximately  and of the company s net sales for fiscal  and  respectively  were attributable to sales to customers for delivery outside of the united states 
the company operates a sales  service  product engineering and limited manufacturing organization in japan  a sales and service organization in germany and a sales and support organization in taiwan 
the company expects that sales of products for delivery outside of the united states will continue to represent a substantial portion of its future revenues 
the future performance of the company will depend  in significant part  upon its ability to continue to compete in foreign markets which in turn will depend  in part  upon a continuation of current trade relations between the united states and foreign countries in which semiconductor manufacturers or assemblers have operations 
a change toward more protectionist trade legislation in either the united states or such foreign countries  such as a change in the current tariff structures  export compliance or other trade policies  could adversely affect the company s ability to sell its products in foreign markets 
in addition  the company is subject to other risks associated with doing business internationally  including longer receivable collection periods and greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection  the burden of complying with a variety of foreign laws  difficulty in staffing and managing global operations  risks of civil disturbance or other events which may limit or disrupt markets  international exchange restrictions  changing political conditions and monetary policies of foreign governments 
a substantial portion of the company s sales has been in asia 
turmoil in the asian financial markets has resulted  and may result in the future  in dramatic currency devaluations  stock market declines  restriction of available credit and general financial weakness 
in addition  dram prices in asia have on occasion declined dramatically  and will likely do so again in the future 
these developments may affect the company in several ways 
the company believes that many international semiconductor manufacturers limited their capital spending including the purchase of mtxs in fiscal years  and  and that the uncertainty of the dram market may cause some manufacturers in the future to again delay capital spending plans 
the economic conditions in asia may also affect the ability of the company s customers to meet their payment obligations  resulting in cancellations or deferrals of existing orders and the limitation of additional orders 
in addition  asian governments have subsidized some portion of fab construction 
financial turmoil may reduce these governments willingness to continue such subsidies 
such developments could have a material adverse affect on the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
because a substantial portion of the company s net sales is from sales of products for delivery outside the united states  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies would increase the cost of the company s products compared to products sold by local companies in such markets 
approximately  and of the company s net sales for fiscal were denominated in us dollars  japanese yen and euros 
although a large percentage of sales to european customers is denominated in us dollars  substantially all sales to japanese customers are denominated in yen 
since the price is determined at the time a purchase order is accepted  the company is exposed to the risks of fluctuations in the yen us dollar exchange rate during the lengthy period from the date a purchase order is received until payment is made 
this exchange rate risk is partially offset to the extent the company s japanese subsidiary incurs expenses payable in yen 
to date  the company has not invested in instruments designed to hedge currency risks 
in addition  the company s japanese subsidiary typically carries debt or other obligations due to the company that may be denominated in either yen or us dollars 
since the financial statements of the japanese subsidiary are based in yen and the financial statements of the company are based in us dollars  the japanese subsidiary and the company recognize currency exchange gain or loss in any period in which the value of the yen rises or falls in relation to the us dollar 
the company recorded a currency exchange gain of  in fiscal the company experienced currency exchange losses of  and  in fiscal and  respectively 
a substantial portion of the world s manufacturers of memory devices are in korea  japan and taiwan and growth in the company s net sales depends in large part upon its ability to penetrate the korean and japanese markets 
both the korean and japanese markets are difficult for foreign companies to penetrate 
the company has served the japanese market through its japanese subsidiary  which has experienced limited success and has incurred operating losses in recent years 
sales into korea have not been significant in recent years 
in fiscal  the company signed an agreement with a new korean distributor 
taiwan represents an increasingly important portion of the memory manufacturer market 
the company established a support organization in taiwan in fiscal and subsequently added a sales function 
the lack of local manufacturing may impede the company s efforts to develop the korean and taiwanese markets 
there can be no assurance that the company s efforts in japan  korea or taiwan will be successful or that the company will be able to achieve and sustain significant sales to  or be able to successfully compete in  the japanese  korean or taiwanese markets 
rapid technological change  importance of timely product introduction 
the semiconductor equipment industry is subject to rapid technological change and new product introductions and enhancements 
the company s ability to remain competitive will depend in part upon its ability to develop new products and to introduce these products at competitive prices and on a timely and cost effective basis 
the company s success in developing new and enhanced products depends upon a variety of factors  including product selection  timely and efficient completion of product design  timely and efficient implementation of manufacturing and assembly processes  product performance in the field and effective sales and marketing 
because new product development commitments must be made well in advance of sales  new product decisions must anticipate both future demand and the technology that will be available to supply that demand 
furthermore  introductions of new and complex products typically involve a period in which design  engineering and reliability issues are identified and addressed by the company and its suppliers 
this process in the past required and in the future is likely to require the company to incur unreimbursed engineering expenses  and from time to time to experience warranty claims or product returns 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in selecting  developing  manufacturing and marketing new products that satisfy market demand 
any such failure would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
because of the complexity of the company s products  significant delays can occur between a product s introduction and the commencement of volume production of such product 
the company has experienced  from time to time  significant delays in the introduction of  and technical and manufacturing difficulties with  certain of its products and may experience delays and technical and manufacturing difficulties in future introductions or volume production of new products 
the company s inability to complete new product development  or to manufacture and ship products in volume and in time to meet customer requirements would materially adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and results of operations 
as is common with new complex and software intensive products  the company has encountered reliability  design and manufacturing issues as it began volume production and initial installations of certain products at customer sites 
the company places a high priority on addressing these issues as they arise 
certain of these issues in the past have been related to components and subsystems supplied to the company by third parties which have in some cases limited the ability of the company to address such issues promptly 
in an early stage of the life cycle of one of the company s products  there can be no assurance that reliability  design and manufacturing issues will not be discovered or  that if such issues arise  they can be resolved to the customers satisfaction or that the resolution of such problems will not cause the company to incur significant development costs or warranty expenses or to lose significant sales opportunities 
future improvements in semiconductor design and manufacturing technology may reduce or eliminate the need for the company s products 
for example  the introduction of viable wafer level burn in and test systems  improvements in bist technology  and improvements in conventional test systems  such as reduced cost or increased throughput  may significantly reduce or eliminate the market for one or more of the company s products 
if the company is not able to improve its products or develop new products or technologies quickly enough to maintain a competitive position in its markets  the company may not be able to grow its business 
intense competition 
in each of the markets it serves  the company faces competition from established competitors and potential new entrants  many of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics 
in addition  continuing consolidation in the semiconductor equipment industry  and potential future consolidation  could adversely affect the ability of smaller companies such as the company to compete with larger  integrated competitors 
new product introductions by the company s competitors or by new market entrants could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s existing products 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price based competition  resulting in lower prices which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company believes that to remain competitive it must invest significant financial resources in new product development and expand its customer service and support worldwide 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
the semiconductor equipment industry is intensely competitive 
significant competitive factors in the semiconductor equipment market include price  technical capabilities  quality  flexibility  automation  cost of ownership  reliability  throughput  product availability and customer service 
in each of the markets it serves  the company faces competition from established competitors and potential new entrants  many of which have greater financial  engineering  manufacturing and marketing resources than the company 
because the company s mtx system performs burn in and many of the functional tests performed by traditional memory testers  the mtx system faces intense competition from burn in system suppliers and traditional memory tester suppliers 
the market for burn in systems is highly fragmented  with many domestic and international suppliers 
some users  such as independent test labs  build their own burn in systems  and some other users  particularly large japanese ic manufacturers  acquire burn in systems from captive or affiliated suppliers 
competing suppliers of burn in and functional test systems include japan engineering company and reliability incorporated 
in addition  suppliers of memory test equipment including advantest corporation and teradyne  inc may seek to offer competitive parallel test systems in the future 
the company s max and atx monitored and dynamic burn in systems increasingly have faced and are expected to continue to face severe competition  especially from local  low cost manufacturers and from systems manufacturers that offer higher power dissipation per ic 
the company s fox full wafer contact system is expected to face competition from larger systems manufacturers that have more advanced technological know how and a broader range of manufacturing resources 
competing suppliers of full wafer contact system include tokyo electron limited and matsushita electric industrial co  ltd 
the company s diepak products face significant competition 
the company believes that several companies have developed or are developing other products which are intended to enable burn in and test of bare die 
as the bare die market develops  the company expects that other competitors will emerge 
the diepak products also face severe competition from other alternative test solutions 
the company expects that the primary competitive factors in this market will be cost  performance  reliability and assured supply 
the company s test fixture products face numerous competitors 
there are limited barriers to entry into the bib market  and as a result  many small companies design and manufacture bibs  including bibs for use with the company s max and atx systems 
the company s strategy is to provide high performance bibs  and the company generally does not compete to supply low cost  low performance bibs 
the company has a partnership with pycon  inc whereby pycon  inc will design  manufacture and sell the bibs and the company will provide pycon  inc with system know how 
both companies will jointly market and sell the bibs and ptbs 
there can be no assurance that the partnership will be successful 
the company has granted royalty bearing licenses to several companies to make ptbs for use with the company s mtx systems  in order to assure customers a second source of supply  and the company may license others as well 
sales of ptbs by licensees result in royalties to the company but reduce the company s own sales of ptbs 
the company expects its competitors to continue to improve the performance of their current products and to introduce new products with improved price and performance characteristics 
new product introductions by the company s competitors or by new market entrants could cause a decline in sales or loss of market acceptance of the company s products 
increased competitive pressure could also lead to intensified price based competition  resulting in lower prices which could adversely affect the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company believes that to remain competitive it must invest significant financial resources in new product development and expand its customer service and support worldwide 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully in the future 
cyclicality of semiconductor industry and customer purchases  risk of cancellations and reschedulings 
the company s operating results depend primarily upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  semiconductor contract assemblers and burn in and test service companies worldwide  which in turn depend on the current and anticipated market demand for ics and products utilizing ics 
the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries in general  and the market for drams and other memory devices in particular  historically have been highly volatile and have experienced periodic downturns and slowdowns  which have had severe negative effects on the semiconductor industry s demand for semiconductor capital equipment  including test and burn in systems manufactured and marketed by the company 
these downturns and slowdowns have adversely affected the company s operating results in the past and in fiscal   and in addition  the purchasing patterns of the company s customers are also highly cyclical because most customers purchase the company s products for use in new production facilities or for upgrading existing test lines for the introduction of next generation products 
construction of new facilities and upgrades of existing facilities have in some cases been delayed or canceled during the most recent semiconductor industry downturn 
a large portion of the company s net sales are attributable to a few customers and therefore a reduction in purchases by one or more customers could materially adversely affect the company s financial results 
there can be no assurance that the semiconductor industry will grow in the future at the same rates it has grown historically 
any downturn or slowdown in the semiconductor industry would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  the need to maintain investment in research and development and to maintain customer service and support will limit the company s ability to reduce its expenses in response to any such downturn or slowdown period 
the semiconductor equipment manufacturing industry has historically been subject to a relatively high rate of purchase order cancellation by customers as compared to other high technology industry sectors 
manufacturing companies that are the customers of semiconductor equipment companies frequently revise  postpone and cancel capital facility expansion plans 
in such cases  semiconductor equipment companies may experience a significant rate of cancellations and reschedulings of purchase orders  as was the case in the industry in late  early    and there can be no assurance that the company will not be materially adversely affected by future cancellations and reschedulings 
dependence on subcontractors  sole or limited sources of supply 
the company relies on subcontractors to manufacture many of the components or subassemblies used in its products 
the company s mtx  max  atx and fox systems and diepak carriers contain several components  including environmental chambers  power supplies  wafer and die contactors  signal distribution substrates and certain ics  which are currently supplied by only one or a limited number of suppliers 
the company s reliance on subcontractors and single source suppliers involves a number of significant risks  including the loss of control over the manufacturing process  the potential absence of adequate capacity and reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields  quality and costs 
in the event that any significant subcontractor or single source supplier was to become unable or unwilling to continue to manufacture subassemblies  components or parts in required volumes  the company would have to identify and qualify acceptable replacements 
the process of qualifying subcontractors and suppliers could be lengthy  and no assurance can be given that any additional sources would be available to the company on a timely basis 
any delay  interruption or termination of a supplier relationship could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
possible volatility of stock price 
the market price of the company s common stock has been  and may continue to be  extremely volatile 
the company believes that factors such as announcements of developments related to the company s business  fluctuations in the company s operating results  failure to meet securities analysts expectations  general conditions in the semiconductor and semiconductor equipment industries and the worldwide economy  announcement of technological innovations  new systems or product enhancements by the company or its competitors  fluctuations in the level of cooperative development funding  acquisitions  changes in governmental regulations  developments in patents or other intellectual property rights and changes in the company s relationships with customers and suppliers could cause the price of the company s common stock to fluctuate substantially 
in addition  in recent years the stock market in general  and the market for small capitalization and high technology stocks in particular  has experienced extreme price fluctuations which have often been unrelated to the operating performance of affected companies 
such fluctuations could adversely affect the market price of the company s common stock 
management of changing business 
if the company is to be successful  it must expand its operations 
such expansion will place a significant strain on the company s administrative  operational and financial resources 
further  such expansion will result in a continuing increase in the responsibility placed upon management personnel and will require development or enhancement of operational  managerial and financial systems and controls 
if the company is unable to manage the expansion of its operations effectively  the company s business  financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
dependence on key personnel  ability to attract and retain skilled personnel 
the company s success depends to a significant extent upon the continued service of rhea posedel  its chief executive officer  as well as other executive officers and key employees 
the company does not maintain key person life insurance for its benefit on any of its personnel  and none of the company s employees is subject to a non competition agreement with the company 
the loss of the services of any of its executive officers or a group of key employees could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company s future success will depend in significant part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  management  sales and marketing personnel 
there is a limited number of personnel with the requisite skills to serve in these positions  and it has become increasingly difficult for the company to hire such personnel 
competition for such personnel in the semiconductor equipment industry is intense  and there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in attracting or retaining such personnel 
the company s inability to attract and retain the executive management and other key personnel it requires will limit its ability to expand its business and would have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
intellectual property protection and infringement 
the company s ability to compete successfully is dependent in part upon its ability to protect its proprietary technology and information 
although the company attempts to protect its proprietary technology through patents  copyrights  trade secrets and other measures  there can be no assurance that these measures will be adequate or that competitors will not be able to develop similar technology independently 
these competitors would then be able to offer services and develop  manufacture and sell products  which compete directly with the company s services and products 
in that case  the company s revenues and operating results could decline 
further  there can be no assurance that claims allowed on any patent issued to the company will be sufficiently broad to protect the company s technology  that any patent will issue from any pending application or that foreign intellectual property laws will protect the company s intellectual property 
the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights to the same extent as the laws of the us  and many companies have encountered significant problems in protecting their proprietary rights in these foreign countries 
these problems can be caused by  for example  a lack of rules and processes allowing for meaningfully defending intellectual property rights 
if the company does not adequately protect its intellectual property  competitors may be able to practice the company s technologies and erode the company s competitive advantage  and the company s business and operating results could be harmed 
litigation may be necessary to enforce or determine the validity and scope of the company s proprietary rights  and there can be no assurance that the company s intellectual property rights  if challenged  will be upheld as valid 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results  regardless of the outcome of the litigation 
in addition  there can be no assurance that any of the patents issued to the company will not be challenged  invalidated or circumvented or that the rights granted thereunder will provide competitive advantages to the company 
the company will be able to protect its proprietary rights from unauthorized use by third parties only to the extent that the company s proprietary technologies are covered by valid and enforceable patents or are effectively maintained trade secrets 
there are no pending claims against the company regarding infringement of any patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
however  the company may receive  in the future  communications from third parties asserting intellectual property claims against the company 
such claims could include assertions that the company s products infringe  or may infringe  the proprietary rights of third parties  requests for indemnification against such infringement or suggestions that the company may be interested in acquiring a license from such third parties 
there can be no assurance that any such claim made in the future will not result in litigation  which could involve significant expense to the company  and  if the company is required or deems it appropriate to obtain a license relating to one or more products or technologies  there can be no assurance that the company would be able to do so on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
environmental regulations 
federal  state and local regulations impose various controls on the use  storage  discharge  handling  emission  generation  manufacture and disposal of toxic or other hazardous substances used in the company s operations 
the company believes that its activities conform in all material respects to current environmental and land use regulations applicable to its operations and its current facilities and that it has obtained environmental permits necessary to conduct its business 
nevertheless  the failure to comply with current or future regulations could result in substantial fines being imposed on the company  suspension of production  alteration of its manufacturing processes or cessation of operations 
such regulations could require the company to acquire expensive remediation equipment or to incur substantial expenses to comply with environmental regulations 
any failure by the company to control the use  disposal or storage of  or adequately restrict the discharge of  hazardous or toxic substances could subject the company to significant liabilities 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s the company considered the provisions of financial reporting release no 
disclosures of accounting policies for derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity instruments  and disclosures of quantitative and qualitative information about market risk inherent in derivative commodity instruments 
the company had no holdings of derivative financial or commodity instruments at may  the company is exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
the company invests excess cash in a managed portfolio of corporate and government bond instruments with maturities of months or less 
the company does not use any financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
fluctuations in interest rates would not have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
a majority of the company s revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
the company  however  enters into transactions in other currencies  primarily japanese yen 
substantially all sales to japanese customers are denominated in yen 
since the price is determined at the time a purchase order is accepted  the company is exposed to the risks of fluctuations in the yen us dollar exchange rate during the lengthy period from purchase order to ultimate payment 
this exchange rate risk is partially offset to the extent that the company s japanese subsidiary incurs expenses payable in yen 
to date  the company has not invested in instruments designed to hedge currency risks 
in addition  the company s japanese subsidiary typically carries debt or other obligations due to the company that may be denominated in either yen or us dollars 
since the japanese subsidiary s financial statements are based in yen and the company s financial statements are based in us dollars  the japanese subsidiary and the company recognize foreign exchange gain or loss in any period in which the value of the yen rises or falls in relation to the us dollar 
a decrease in the value of the yen as compared with the us dollar would potentially result in an additional net loss of approximately
