overview we are an equity real estate investment trust specializing in the ownership  management  development and redevelopment of high quality retail and mixed use properties 
as of december   we owned or had an interest in community and neighborhood shopping centers comprising over million square feet  primarily located in densely populated and affluent communities throughout the northeast and mid atlantic united states 
in addition  we owned urban and retail mixed use properties comprising over million square feet and one apartment complex  all located in strategic metropolitan markets across the united states 
our properties  excluding santana row were leased at december  and december  including santana row our occupancy was at december  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which we refer to as gaap  requires management to make estimates and assumptions that in certain circumstances affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities  and revenues and expenses 
these estimates are prepared using management s best judgment  after considering past and current events and economic conditions 
in addition  information relied upon by management in preparing such estimates includes internally generated financial and operating information  external market information when available  and when necessary  information obtained from consultations with third party experts 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
the most significant accounting policies which involve the use of estimates and assumptions as to future uncertainties and  therefore  may result in actual amounts that differ from estimates  are as follows 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable leases with tenants are classified as operating leases 
base rents are recognized on a straight line basis over the terms of the related leases  net of valuation adjustments  based on management s assessment of credit  collection and other business risk 
we make estimates of the collectibility of our accounts receivable related to base rents  including straight line rentals  expense reimbursements and other revenue or income 
in some cases the ultimate collectibility of these claims extends beyond one year 
these estimates have a direct impact on our net income 
we believe that our revenue recognition policies comply with both generally accepted accounting principles and the securities and exchange commissions staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition 
real estate land  buildings and real estate under development are recorded at cost 
depreciation is computed using the straight line method with useful lives ranging from three to years on buildings and improvements 
maintenance and repair costs are charged to operations as incurred 
tenant work and other major improvements  which improve or extend the life of the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over the life of the lease or the estimated useful life of the improvements  whichever is shorter 
certain external and internal costs directly related to the development  redevelopment and leasing of real estate  including applicable salaries and the related direct costs  are capitalized 
the capitalized costs associated with developments  redevelopments and leasing are depreciated or amortized over the life of the improvement and lease  respectively 
unamortized leasing costs are charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates before the expiration of its lease 
undepreciated tenant work is charged to operations if the applicable tenant vacates and the tenant work is replaced 
when applicable as lessee  we classify our leases of land and building as operating or capital leases in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for leases 
we are required to use judgment and make estimates in determining the lease term  the estimated economic life of the property and the interest rate to be used in applying the provisions of sfas no 
these estimates determine whether or not the lease meets the qualification of a capital lease and is recorded as an asset 
we are required to make subjective assessments as to the useful lives of our real estate for purposes of determining the amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis 
these assessments have a direct impact on net income 
should we lengthen the expected useful life of an asset  it would be depreciated over a greater number of years  resulting in less annual depreciation expense and higher annual net income 
likewise  we must make subjective assumptions as to which costs should be capitalized 
these assumptions also have a direct impact on net income 
interest costs on developments and major redevelopments are capitalized as part of developments and redevelopments not yet placed in service 
capitalization of interest commences when development activities and expenditures begin and end upon completion  which is when the asset is ready for its intended use 
generally  rental property is considered substantially complete and ready for its intended use upon completion of tenant improvements  but no later than one year from completion of major construction activity 
we make judgments as to the time period over which to capitalize such costs and these assumptions have a direct impact on net income because capitalized costs are not subtracted in calculating net income 
if the time period is extended  more interest is capitalized  thereby increasing net income 
long lived assets through december   we evaluated the carrying value of our long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
in cases where particular assets are being held for sale  impairment is based on whether the fair value estimated sales price less costs of disposal of each individual property to be sold is less than the net book value 
otherwise  impairment is based on whether it is probable that undiscounted future cash flows from each property will be less than its net book value 
if a property is impaired  its basis is adjusted to its estimated fair market value 
in august the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets effective for us on january  
sfas no 
requires that one accounting model be used for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired  and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include components of an entity comprising operations and cash flows that can be distinguished  operationally and for financial reporting purposes from the rest of the entity 
we are required to make estimates of undiscounted cash flows in determining whether there is an impairment 
actual results could be significantly different from the estimates 
these estimates have a direct impact on net income  because recording an impairment charge results in a negative adjustment to net income 
contingencies we are sometimes involved in lawsuits and environmental matters arising in the ordinary course of business 
management makes assumptions and estimates concerning the amount and likelihood of loss relating to these matters 
these estimates and assumptions have a direct impact on net income 
outlook growth in net income and ffo during will depend primarily on growth in the core portfolio 
growth of net income from the core portfolio depends  in part  on the general economy  the financial health of our tenants and on our ability  directly or indirectly  to control expenses  some of which are beyond our complete control  such as snow removal  insurance and real estate tax assessments 
the current weakening of the retail and overall economic environment could adversely impact us by increasing vacancies and decreasing rents 
in past weak retail and real estate environments  however  we have been able to replace weak and bankrupt tenants with stronger tenants 
management believes that due to the quality of our properties there will continue to be demand for our space 
our properties  excluding santana row were leased at december  and december  including santana row our occupancy was at december  growth in the core portfolio  however  will be offset by expenses at santana row 
operating and marketing expenses  as well as additional depreciation and interest expense as the project is phased into operations will have a dilutive effect on earnings 
as a result of the august fire at santana row  as more fully described in this section at santana row  the projected opening of certain retail spaces have been delayed and approximately of the total residential units for the project scheduled to be phased into service throughout were destroyed 
these delayed openings  while lowering the income we will receive  will not substantially reduce the costs associated with maintaining and operating the infrastructure of the project 
growth in net income is also dependent on the amount of our leverage and interest rates 
our leverage has increased as we financed our development projects 
in addition  to the extent variable rate debt is unhedged  we will continue to have exposure to changes in market interest rates although we have reduced this exposure as of december  as compared to december  if interest rates increase  net income and ffo  as well as the ultimate cost of our development and redevelopment projects  will be negatively impacted 
property acquisitions and dispositions acquisitions we did not acquire any properties in dispositions on april   we sold the street retail property located at greenwich avenue in greenwich  connecticut for million  resulting in a gain of million 
on april   we sold three street retail properties  two in westport  connecticut and one in westfield  new jersey  for million  resulting in a gain of million 
on june   we sold the uptown shopping center located in portland  oregon for million  resulting in a gain of million 
the proceeds from the sales of the four street retail properties and the uptown shopping center were used to pay down our syndicated credit facility except million which was used to pay down the santana row construction loan 
as of december  all of the proceeds previously held by the qualified intermediary have been released to us 
on june   a partnership  in which one of our subsidiaries is the general partner  sold the street retail property located at hollywood boulevard in hollywood  california for million  resulting in a gain of on june   the proceeds of million previously held by a qualified intermediary from the sale of the street retail property located at east oak street in chicago  illinois were released to us 
financing developments on february   we received the minority partner s interest in santana row in exchange for a million investment in a partnership 
we made a million loan to the partnership on january   that is due february  the loan was not repaid on the due date 
we are currently exploring all available options we may have as a result of the borrowers failure to pay at maturity 
on june  we issued million common shares at per share netting million  after all expenses of the offering 
on november   we completed the sale of million of senior notes in an underwritten public offering under our shelf registration statement declared effective by the sec on september  net proceeds  after deducting the discounts and commissions to the underwriters and other expenses of this offering  totaled approximately million 
we used the net proceeds  together with million in available insurance proceeds relating to the santana row fire  and approximately million in borrowings under our credit facility  to pay in full and retire the santana row construction loan  including all interest owed on the loan 
santana row in  our single largest capital need was the development of santana row  a multi phase mixed use project being built on acres in san jose  california in the heart of silicon valley 
the project will consist of residential  retail and hotel components  creating a community with the feel of an urban district 
phase i of the project includes santana row  the  foot long main street and eight buildings which will contain approximately  square feet of retail space  residential units  a room hotel and the supporting infrastructure 
the first building  containing  square feet and occupied by crate barrel  opened on june  six buildings comprising approximately  square feet of retail space opened on november  tenants in the final  square foot building in phase i are expected to begin opening in early as of february   approximately  square feet  or  of the phase i retail space is leased  of which approximately  square feet  or  of the phase i retail space is open 
on august  a fire broke out at building seven in the santana row project 
building seven contained approximately  square feet of retail space  approximately  parking spaces and residential units 
all but eleven of the residential units in the building  which were originally scheduled to open in early  were destroyed 
the retail units and parking structure sustained water and smoke damage but were not structurally impaired 
the opening of these retail units  originally scheduled for september  will be delayed until early the damage related to the fire was limited almost entirely to this single building 
we believe that our insurance coverage will substantially cover our losses from the fire 
we estimate the insurance claim to be in the range of million to million which includes costs to clean up  repair and rebuild as well as soft non construction costs and lost rents 
the cause of the fire is unknown but will not affect our insurance claim 
on october   a million insurance reimbursement was advanced by the insurance carrier bringing the total amount received to date to million 
this advance  along with the proceeds from the november  note offering and borrowings under our credit facility  were used to pay in full and retire the santana row construction loan 
because our final insurance claim has not yet been submitted  insurance proceeds expected to be received over and above those received to date have not been recorded in our december  financial statements 
we estimate the total cost of phase i to be approximately million  net of anticipated insurance proceeds 
insurance proceeds could exceed our to million estimate due to increased fire related costs 
insurance proceeds increased by such costs would therefore not reduce our anticipated phase i investment below million 
as of december   before applying the million of insurance proceeds received to date  we have incurred costs of million including the purchase of all of the project s  land  the construction of phase i  costs associated with the building seven fire and related cleanup and costs related to future phases of the project 
we estimate that we will spend approximately million  before insurance reimbursements  in relating to the completion of phase i of the project 
we are evaluating our building seven residential options and alternatives taking into account costs incurred to date  costs to rebuild and market conditions and believe that we will be able to rebuild a residential component for building seven on economically favorable terms as part of a future phase of the project 
the success of santana row will depend on many factors which cannot be assured and are not entirely within our control 
these factors include among others  the demand for retail and residential space  the cost of operations  including utilities and insurance  the availability and cost of capital and the general economy  particularly in the silicon valley 
on february   we announced plans for phase ii of santana row  which includes  square feet of retail space on two pad sites and additional parking spaces 
of the phase ii retail space has been pre leased to best buy and the container store 
total development costs are expected to be approximately million 
we have not determined the scope of future phases of santana row and will not do so until the success of phase i  phase ii and future demand for rental space is determined 
however  as phases i and ii utilize only part of the retail and residential entitlements of the property  and as phase i includes the costs of land and infrastructure for future phases  we expect to identify and execute relatively small  additional phases on economically favorable terms 
new business plan  restructuring charges and ceo transition on february   we adopted a new business plan which returned our primary focus to our traditional business of acquiring and redeveloping community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by supermarkets  drug stores  or high volume  value oriented retailers that provide consumer necessities 
we will complete bethesda row and santana row pentagon row was completed in but do not plan to develop any new large scale  mixed use  ground up development projects 
rather  we will seek to acquire income producing centers around our existing markets and will identify and execute redevelopment opportunities in our existing portfolio 
concurrent with the adoption of the business plan  we adopted a management succession plan and restructured our management team 
in connection with this change in our business plan  we recorded a charge of million 
this charge included a reserve for a restructuring charge of million made up of million of severance and other compensation costs for several of our senior officers related to the management restructuring  as well as the write off of million of development costs 
all charges against the reserve  totaling million  were expended during an additional component of the restructuring charge is an impairment loss of million representing the estimated loss on the abandonment of development projects held for sale  primarily the tanasbourne development project located in portland  oregon  thereby adjusting the value of these assets to their estimated fair value 
we are marketing these properties for sale 
the carrying value of these properties as of december   classified on our consolidated balance sheet as real estate under development  is million 
on december   we announced the resignation of steven j 
guttman as trustee  chief executive officer and chairman of the board of trustees effective january  donald c 
wood  our then president and chief operating officer  was named chief executive officer and a member of the board of trustees 
mark ordan  a member of the board of trustees since  was named non executive chairman of the board 
as a result of this transition  we recorded a charge of million in the fourth quarter of for payments and benefits to mr 
guttman pursuant to his contractual arrangements with us and for other transition related costs 
of this amount  had not been paid as of december   the majority of which was paid in the first quarter of results of operations comparison of to throughout this section  we have provided certain information on a same center basis 
information provided on a same center basis is provided only for those properties owned and operated in the periods being compared and includes properties which were redeveloped or expanded during the periods being compared 
properties purchased or sold and properties under development during the periods being compared are excluded 
revenue total revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the primary components of the increase in total revenues are discussed below 
rental income 
rental income consists of minimum rent  percentage rent and cost recoveries for common area maintenance and real estate taxes 
the increase in rental income of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to 
an increase of million in rental income attributable to the properties acquired subsequent to january  and properties under development in and which phased into service during and  specifically santana row and pentagon row 
these increases were offset by properties sold in  and 
an increase of million  or  on a same center basis due primarily to the increased rental rates at redeveloped and retenanted centers  as well as increased rental rates associated with lease rollovers and higher cost recoveries as a result of increased rental expenses and real estate tax expenses 
same center basis for the year ended december  excludes the six properties sold in  the williamsburg shopping center in williamsburg  virginia  e 
oak street in chicago  illinois and austin street in forest hills  new york which were sold in  friendship center in washington  dc which was purchased on september   the office building located at market street in san francisco  california which was exchanged for the minority partner s interest in santana row and properties under development in and  including pentagon row in arlington  virginia and santana row in san jose  california 
same center rental income  excluding the contribution from property redevelopments and expansions  for the year ended december  increased from  reflecting increases due to retenanting  lease rollovers and cost recoveries 
interest and other income 
interest and other income includes interest earned on mortgage notes receivable  overnight cash investments  including tax deferred exchange escrow deposits  as well as a provision for estimated losses related to various unconsolidated restaurant joint ventures at santana row 
the decrease in interest and other income of million  or for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to a write down associated with the estimated impairment of million which represents our best estimate of the diminution of value based upon the current economic climate surrounding these joint ventures 
other property income 
other property income includes items  which although recurring  tend to fluctuate more than rental income from period to period  such as utility reimbursements  telephone income  merchant association dues  late fees  lease termination fees and temporary tenant income 
the increase in other property income of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to 
a one time  perpetual easement payment from a residential developer that has commenced development on an adjacent site at the pentagon row project  
increases of million in parking income  utility reimbursements and lease termination fees at pentagon row  which began phasing into service in the second quarter of  santana row  which began phasing into service in the fourth quarter of and friendship center which was purchased in the third quarter of  partially offset by 
lower lease termination fees and parking income from properties owned and operated in both periods 
on a same center basis  other property income decreased  in as compared to  as explained above 
expenses total expenses increased million to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the primary components of the increase in total expenses are discussed below 
rental expense 
the increase in rental expense of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to 
an increase of million in non capitalized operating  leasing and marketing costs associated with our development projects  primarily operating  pre opening and marketing expenses at our santana row project  as well as increased costs reflecting a full year of operating activity at the pentagon row project  and 
an increase of million  or  on a same center basis due primarily to increased maintenance  insurance and utility costs  offset by lower bad debt and property management costs 
rental expense as a percentage of rental income and other property income  which we refer to as property income  increased slightly from in to in due primarily to increased marketing and pre opening expenses at santana row 
same center rental expense  excluding the effect of property redevelopments and expansions  as a percentage of property income decreased slightly from in to in and overall for the year ended december  increased from real estate taxes 
the increase in real estate taxes of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to increased taxes on new development projects  recently redeveloped properties and overall increases in tax assessments 
on a same center basis  real estate taxes increased due primarily to increased taxes on recently redeveloped properties and overall increases in tax assessments at various projects  principally woodmont east  fresh meadows  garden market and mid pike 
same center real estate taxes  excluding the effect of property redevelopments and expansions  for the year ended december  increased from property operating income 
as a result of the changes and variances explained above  operating property income  total income less rental expenses and real estate taxes  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense 
in  we incurred interest expense of million  of which million was capitalized yielding interest expense of million  as compared to interest of million in  of which million was capitalized yielding interest expense of million 
the decrease in interest expense of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to 
a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our debt from in to in  primarily as a result of decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt  and 
increased capitalized interest at the santana row project which was under construction for the majority of and began to be phased into service beginning with the first tenant opening in june administrative expense 
the decrease in administrative expense of  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is mostly attributable to lower payroll costs in as a result of our corporate restructuring 
as a result  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased from in the year ended december  to in the year ended december  restructuring charge 
on february   we adopted a new business plan which returned our primary focus to our traditional business of acquiring and redeveloping community and neighborhood shopping centers that are anchored by supermarkets  drug stores  or high volume  value oriented retailers that provide consumer necessities 
concurrently with the adoption of the business plan  we adopted a management succession plan and restructured our management team 
in connection with this change in business plan  we recorded a charge of million 
this charge included a reserve for a restructuring charge of million made up of million of severance and other compensation costs for several of our senior officers related to the management restructuring  as well as the write off of million of our development costs 
all charges against the reserve  totaling million  were expended during please see new business plan  restructuring charges and ceo transition for additional information 
in addition  in the fourth quarter of we recorded a charge of million as a result of the accelerated executive transition whereby donald c 
wood  the trust s president and chief operating officer  replaced steven guttman as chief executive officer of the trust 
the fourth quarter charge  which includes an accrual of million at december  for payments and benefits due to mr 
guttman pursuant to his contractual arrangements with us and for other transition related costs 
no cash payments were made against this charge in and we expect to expend the majority of the accrual in depreciation and amortization expense 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  reflects the impact of recent new developments  tenant improvements and property redevelopments which were placed into service throughout and other investors share of operations 
investors share of operations represents the minority partner s interest in the income of certain properties 
the decrease in investors share of operations of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to our purchase of the minority interest in nine street retail buildings in southern california and three street retail buildings in forest hills  new york and the operating unit holders share of the decrease in operating income in gain on sale of real estate net of loss on abandoned developments held for sale 
the approximately  increase in gain on sale of real estate  net of loss on abandoned developments held for sale for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to 
an increase in net gains recognized in from the sale of six properties for a combined gain of million in the second quarter of  as compared to the sale of one shopping center in the second quarter of for a gain of million  the sale of one street retail property in the fourth quarter of for a gain of million and the exchange of a interest in a street retail building for a interest in three street retail buildings with a minority partner which resulted in an accounting loss of  in the fourth quarter of  primarily offset by 
the impairment loss of million on the abandonment of developments held for sale as described under new business plan  restructuring charges and ceo transition 
income from operations of discontinued assets 
beginning in  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that gains and losses from dispositions of properties and all operating earnings from these properties be reported as income from operations of discontinued assets 
this also requires that all past earnings applicable to a property disposed of subsequent to january  be reported as income from operations of discontinued assets 
as a result  previously reported income will be updated each time a property is sold 
this requirement is for presentation only and has no impact on net income 
as described above  in  we sold six properties for a combined gain of million 
the earnings generated from these properties have been reported as income from operations of discontinued assets in accordance with sfas no 
income from operations of discontinued assets for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively with the decrease being primarily due to the fact that these properties were owned for less than a full year in comparison of to revenue total revenues increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the primary components of the increase in total revenues are discussed below 
rental income 
the increase in rental income of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to 
an increase of million in rental income attributable to the properties acquired subsequent to january  and properties under development in and which began phasing into service during  specifically pentagon row and woodmont east 
these increases were offset by properties sold in and  and 
an increase of million  or  on a same center basis due primarily to the increased rental rates at redeveloped and retenanted centers  as well as increased rental rates associated with lease rollovers and higher cost recoveries 
same center basis for the year ended december  excludes the six properties sold in because they have been reclassified to income from operations of discontinued assets on the consolidated statements of operations  the williamsburg shopping center in williamsburg  virginia and peninsula shopping center in palos verdes  california which were sold on april  and june   respectively  as well as  properties acquired and properties under development in and  including friendship center in washington  dc  woodmont east in bethesda  maryland  pentagon row in arlington  virginia  wilshire boulevard in santa monica  california and town country shopping center in san jose  california  which was demolished to make way for the santana row development 
interest and other income 
the decrease in interest and other income of  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to a decrease in interest earned on mortgage notes receivable which reflects the million decrease in mortgage notes receivable from december  to december  other property income 
the increase in other property income of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to 
an approximate million increase in lease termination fees  and 
increased parking income and utility reimbursements 
on a same center basis  other property income during the year ended december  increased from the year ended december  expenses total expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   as compared to million for the year ended december  the primary components of the decrease in total expenses are discussed below 
rental expense 
the increase in rental expense of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to 
an increase of million in operating  leasing and marketing costs associated with our development projects  primarily leasing and marketing expenses at our santana row project  as well as increased costs reflecting the increased operating activity at the pentagon row and woodmont east projects  and 
an increase of million  or  on a same center basis due primarily to general cost increases along with increased property management costs in  partially offset by 
a decrease of  in operating costs related to properties acquired and sold during the two periods 
rental expense as a percentage of rental income and other property income  which we refer to as property income  increased slightly from in to in due primarily to the increased leasing and marketing expenses at santana row 
real estate taxes 
the increase in real estate taxes of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable primarily to increased tax assessments on recently redeveloped properties partially offset by taxes on properties sold in and on a same center basis  real estate taxes increased  reflecting the increases on redeveloped properties 
property operating income 
as a result of the changes and variances explained above  property operating income  total income less rental expenses and real estate taxes  increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  interest expense 
in  we incurred interest expense of million  of which million was capitalized  as compared to s million  of which million was capitalized 
the increase in interest expense of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to 
increased mortgage interest  primarily due to the million of mortgages placed on five properties in the fourth quarter of  partially offset by 
a decrease in the weighted average interest rate on our debt from in to in  primarily as a result of the decrease in interest rates on our variable rate debt  and 
increased capitalized interest at the santana row project which was under construction during administrative expense 
the increase in administrative expense of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to increased personnel costs  legal and accounting fees 
however  administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue decreased slightly in to from in depreciation and amortization expense 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   reflects the impact of recent new development  tenant improvements and property redevelopments which were placed in service during the year  specifically the pentagon row and woodmont east developments 
other investors share of operations 
the decrease in investors share of operations of million  or  for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to our buy out of the minority partners in nine street retail buildings in southern california  thereby increasing our ownership in these buildings to 
gain on sale of real estate net of loss on abandoned developments held for sale 
the increase in gain on sale of real estate  net of loss on abandoned developments held for sale  of million for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december   is attributable to an increase in net gains recognized in from 
the sale of one shopping center in the second quarter of for a gain of million  and 
the sale of one street retail property in the fourth quarter of for a gain of million  partially offset by 
the exchange of our interest in a street retail building to the minority partner in exchange for the minority partner s interest in three other street retail buildings in the fourth quarter of resulting in a loss of approximately  as compared to 
the sale of one shopping center in the second quarter of for a gain of million income from operations of discontinued assets 
beginning in  sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that gains and losses from dispositions of properties and all operating earnings from these properties be reported as income from operations of discontinued assets 
this also requires that all past earnings applicable to a property disposed of subsequent to january  be reported as income from operations of discontinued assets 
as a result  previously reported income will be updated each time a property is sold 
this requirement is for presentation only and has no impact on net income 
as described above  in  we sold six properties for a combined gain of million 
the earnings generated from these properties have been reported as income from operations of discontinued assets in accordance with sfas no 
income from operations of discontinued assets for the years ended december  and was million and million  respectively 
segment results we operate our business on an asset management model  where small focused teams are responsible for a portfolio of assets 
we have divided our portfolio of properties into three operating regions the northeast  mid atlantic and west

restricting our ability to incur additional debt  
restricting our ability to amend or modify existing leases

if we were to breach any of our debt covenants  including the listed covenants  and did not cure the breach within any applicable cure period  our lenders could require us to repay the debt immediately  and  if the debt is secured  could immediately begin proceedings to take possession of the property securing the loan 
many of our debt arrangements  including our public notes and our credit facility are cross defaulted which means that the lenders under those debt arrangements can put us in default and require immediate repayment of their debt if we breach and fail to cure a covenant under certain of our other debt obligations 
as a result  any default under our debt covenants could have an adverse effect on our financial condition  our results of operations  our ability to meet our obligations and the market value of our shares

also see liquidity requirements in this section regarding management s plans with respect to debt maturing in interest rate hedging we enter into derivative contracts  which qualify as cash flow hedges under sfas no 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  in order to manage interest rate risk 
derivatives are not purchased for speculation 
during  to hedge our exposure to interest rates on our million term loan  we entered into interest rate swaps  which fixed the libor interest rate on the term loan at 
the current interest rate on the term loan is libor plus basis points  thus fixing the interest rate at on notional amounts totaling million 
we are exposed to credit loss in the event of non performance by the counterparties to the interest rate protection agreement should interest rates exceed the cap 
however  management does not anticipate non performance by the counterparties 
the counterparties have long term debt ratings of a or above by standard and poor s ratings service s p and aa or above by moody s investors service moody s 
although our cap is not exchange traded  there are a number of financial institutions which enter into these types of transactions as part of their day to day activities 
the interest rate swaps mature concurrently with the million term loan on december  the swaps were documented as cash flow hedges and designated as effective at inception of the swap contract 
consequently  the unrealized gain or loss upon measuring the swaps at their fair value is recorded as a component of other comprehensive income within shareholders equity and either a derivative instrument asset or liability is recorded on the balance sheet 
at december   a cumulative unrealized loss of million  representing the difference between the current market value and the fixed interest rate on the swap  was recorded in other comprehensive income with a corresponding derivative liability on the balance sheet 
interest expense of approximately million will be reclassified from other comprehensive income into current earnings during to bring the effective interest rate up to 
in anticipation of a million senior unsecured note offering  on august   we entered into a treasury rate lock that fixed the benchmark five year treasury rate at through august  the rate lock was documented as a cash flow hedge of a forecasted transaction and designated as effective at the inception of the contract 
on august   we priced the senior unsecured notes with a scheduled closing date of august  and closed out the associated rate lock 
five year treasury rates declined between the pricing period and the settlement of the hedge purchase  therefore  to settle the rate lock  we paid million 
as a result of the august  fire at santana row  we elected not to proceed with the note offering at that time 
however  we consummated a senior unsecured note offering on november   and thus  the hedge loss will be amortized into interest expense over the life of these notes 
liquidity requirements as of december   we had unfunded contractual payment obligations of approximately million due within the next twelve months

based on management s current estimate of fair market value  our estimated liability upon exercise of the put option is approximately million 
since the timing of this transaction is unknown  the put option is excluded from our capital requirements 
in conjunction with a redevelopment currently taking place at the property  we have agreed to acquire an additional interest in congressional plaza from rpc  thereby lowering their ownership percentage to  in exchange for funding approximately million of rpc s share of the redevelopment cost 
the funding will take place through the first quarter of and the transaction will be completed in after the completion of this transaction  our estimated liability upon the exercise of the put option will be approximately million 
under the terms of four partnerships which own street retail properties in southern california with a cost of approximately million  if certain leasing and revenue levels are obtained for the properties owned by the partnerships  the other partners may require us to purchase their partnership interests at a formula price based upon net operating income 
the purchase price may be paid in cash or  for two of the partnerships  a limited number of our common shares at the election of the other partners 
because we may elect to issue common shares in settlement of part of our obligations  we have excluded these amounts from our capital requirements 
in certain of these partnerships  if the other partners do not redeem their interest  we may choose to purchase the limited partnership interests upon the same terms 
under the terms of various other partnerships which own shopping center properties with a cost of approximately million  the partners may exchange their  operating units for cash or the same number of our common shares  at our option 
because we may elect to issue common shares in settlement of our obligation we have excluded these amounts from our capital requirements

street retail san antonio lp  a wholly owned subsidiary of the trust  entered into a development agreement the agreement on march  with the city of san antonio  texas the city related to the redevelopment of land and buildings that we own along houston street in the city 
houston street and the surrounding area have been designated by the city as a reinvestment zone the zone 
the city has agreed to facilitate redevelopment of the zone by undertaking and financing certain public improvements based on our agreement to redevelop our properties in the zone 
under the terms of the agreement  the city issued debt to fund specific public improvements within the zone 
the initial and primary source of funding to the city for repayment of the debt and debt service is the incremental tax revenue that accretes to the city as the taxable value of the redeveloped properties within the zone increase 
we are required to issue an annual letter of credit  commencing on october  through september   that covers our designated portion of the debt service should the incremental tax revenue generated not cover the debt service 
we posted a letter of credit with the city on september  for  our obligation under this agreement cannot be determined at this time because it is dependent on the annual assessed value of the properties in the zone and the related tax revenue generated 
we were not required to provide any funding in or for the semi annual payment due march  based on the current assessed value of the properties in the zone  we expect to provide some funding under the agreement prior to its expiration on september   but anticipate that our obligation will not exceed  in any year and will be between million and million in total 
if the zone creates sufficient tax increment funding to repay the city s debt prior to the expiration of the agreement  we will be eligible to receive reimbursement of amounts paid for debt service shortfalls together with interest thereon 
as of december   our current contractual payment obligations due within one year total approximately million 
included in this amount is million that represents our revolving credit facility and term loan which mature on december   which we plan to renew 
in addition to our contractual obligations we have other short term liquidity requirements consisting primarily of normal recurring operating expenses  regular debt service requirements including debt service relating to additional and replacement debt  recurring corporate expenditures  non recurring corporate expenditures such as tenant improvements and redevelopments and dividends to common and preferred shareholders 
overall capital requirements in will depend upon acquisition opportunities  the level of improvements and redevelopments on existing properties and the timing and cost of future phases of santana row 
we expect to fund the remaining capital requirements of million  as well as our development and redevelopment costs  acquisitions and normal recurring operating costs through a combination of cash provided by operating activities  borrowings under our credit facility and other funding sources which may consist of additional debt  both secured and unsecured  additional equity  joint venture relationships and property dispositions 
we expect to fund our long term capital requirements  which consist primarily of maturities under our long term debt  development and redevelopment costs and potential acquisition opportunities through a combination of funding sources which we believe will be available to us including debt  both secured and unsecured  additional equity  joint venture relationships and property dispositions 
the following factors could affect our ability to meet our liquidity requirements 
we may be unable to obtain debt or equity financing on favorable terms  or at all  as a result of our financial condition or market conditions at the time we seek additional financing  
restrictions on our debt instruments or outstanding equity may prohibit us from incurring debt or issuing equity at all  or on terms available under then prevailing market conditions  and 
we may be unable to service additional or replacement debt due to increases in interest rates or a decline in our operating performance 
dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan we have implemented a dividend reinvestment and share purchase plan  which was subsequently amended in march the drip 
under the drip  current shareholders are permitted to elect to reinvest all  a portion or none of their cash dividends to purchase common shares 
the drip also allows both new investors and existing shareholders to make optional cash payments to purchase common shares 
the drip permits current shareholders and new investors to invest a minimum of up to a maximum of  in common shares per month 
shares purchased under the drip through reinvestment of dividends and optional cash payments are purchased at market price 
common shares may be purchased directly from the company or in open market purchases  as we determine from time to time  to fulfill the requirements for the drip 
we issued  and  common shares under the drip and received approximately million and million in proceeds for the years ended december  and  respectively 
stock purchase plan in  the board of trustees of the company approved a stock purchase plan the espp under section of the code 
the espp is regarded as a noncompensatory plan under apb no 
 because it meets the qualifications under irc under the terms of the espp  eligible employees may purchase common shares of the company at a price that is equal to of the lower of the common shares fair market value at the beginning or the end of a quarterly period 
the fair market value of a common share is equal to the last sale price of the common shares on the new york stock exchange 
eligible employees may purchase the common shares through payroll deductions of up to of eligible compensation 
the espp is not subject to the provisions of erisa 
the espp terminated on january  under the terms of the espp  eligible employees had purchased  common shares at per share with the assistance of loans of million from us 
originally  espp called for one sixteenth of the loan to be forgiven each year for eight years  as long as the participant was still employed by us 
the loans for all participants  but two  were modified in to extend the term an additional four years and to tie forgiveness in and thereafter to certain criteria related to our performance 
one sixteenth of the loan has been forgiven during each year of the plan 
at december   we had outstanding purchase loans to participants of approximately  the purchase loans bear interest at 
the shares purchased under the plan may not be sold  pledged or assigned until both the purchase and tax loans associated with the plan are satisfied and the term has expired  without the consent of the compensation committee of the board of trustees 
on january   a  loan was repaid 
reit qualification we intend to maintain our qualification as a reit under section c of the code 
as a reit  we generally will not be subject to corporate federal income taxes as long as we satisfy certain technical requirements of the code  including the requirement to distribute of our reit taxable income to our shareholders 
funds from operations we have historically reported our ffo in addition to our net income and net cash provided by operating activities 
ffo is a supplemental non gaap financial measure of real estate companies operating performance 
nareit defines ffo as follows income available for common shareholders before depreciation and amortization of real estate assets and before extraordinary items less gains on sale of real estate 
nareit developed ffo as a relative measure of performance and liquidity of an equity reit in order to recognize that the value of income producing real estate historically has not depreciated on the basis determined under gaap 
however  ffo 
does not represent cash flows from operating activities in accordance with gaap which  unlike ffo  generally reflects all cash effects of transactions and other events in the determination of net income  
should not be considered an alternative to net income as an indication of our performance  and 
is not necessarily indicative of cash flow as a measure of liquidity or ability to pay dividends 
we consider ffo a meaningful  additional measure of operating performance because it primarily excludes the assumption that the value of the real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  and because industry analysts have accepted it as a performance measure 
comparison of our presentation of ffo to similarly titled measures for other reits may not necessarily be meaningful due to possible differences in the application of the nareit definition used by such reits 
an increase or decrease in ffo does not necessarily result in an increase or decrease in aggregate distributions because our board of trustees is not required to increase distributions on a quarterly basis unless necessary for us to maintain reit status 
however  we must distribute of our reit taxable income as defined in the code 
therefore  a significant increase in ffo will generally require an increase in distributions to shareholders although not necessarily on a proportionate basis

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our use of financial instruments  such as debt instruments  subject us to market risk which may affect our future earnings and cash flows as well as the fair value of our assets 
market risk generally refers to the risk of loss from changes in interest rates and market prices 
we manage our market risk by attempting to match anticipated inflow of cash from our operating  investing and financing activities with anticipated outflow of cash to fund debt payments  dividends to common and preferred shareholders  investments  capital expenditures and other cash requirements 
we also enter into derivative financial instruments such as interest rate swaps to mitigate our interest rate risk on a related financial instrument or to effectively lock the interest rate on a portion of our variable rate debt 
the following discussion of market risk is based solely on hypothetical changes in interest rates related to our variable rate debt 
this discussion does not purport to take into account all of the factors that may affect the financial instruments discussed in this section 
interest rate risk our interest rate risk is most sensitive to fluctuations in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt 
based upon this balance of variable operating debt  if interest rates increased  our earnings and cash flows would decrease by approximately million 
if interest rates decreased  our earnings and cash flows would increase by approximately million 
we believe that the change in the fair value of our financial instruments resulting from a foreseeable fluctuation in interest rates would be immaterial to our total assets and total liabilities 
interest rate hedging we use derivative financial instruments to convert a portion of our variable rate debt to fixed rate debt and to manage our fixed to variable rate debt ratio 
a description of these derivative financial instruments is contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources interest rate hedging
