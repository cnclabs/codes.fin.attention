this discussion should be read in conjunction with the financial statements and the information set forth under item selected financial data  found in this form k 
centerpoint value added strategy centerpoint is focused on maximizing total shareholder returns through customer driven management  investment  development  and redevelopment of warehouse  distribution  light manufacturing  intermodal parks and air freight buildings 
the company seeks to entrepreneurially serve the changing space needs of new and existing customers 
these value added activities  the company believes  contributes to better investment returns  cash flow  and cash flows growth  which increase the value of the company s franchise and permit growing distributions 
a cornerstone of this company s value added strategy is the consistent redeployment of its capital for uses that offer the highest potential returns and growth 
the company seeks to fund new high yield investment with disposition proceeds from the sale of stabilized assets  or those offering lower potential returns relative to their market value 
each year the company expects to sell to of its assets which  together with retained cash flow  offset a majority of its capital requirements 
centerpoint believes its capital recycling discipline improves shareholder value by increasing the return on invested capital  accelerated return growth  and by lowering its cost of capital through increased funding flexibility 
the company s results include gains resulting from its disposition activity 
the contribution of gains to earnings is a function of the investment profits created by the company s recycling activities and the rate at which assets are sold  which is dependent on the available volume of new investment 
the company believes its business model is captured in its own definition of funds from operations ffo  which is a national association of real estate investment trusts nareit sponsored industry metric for earnings 
nareit defines ffo april  white paper as net income excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization 
nareit adds  management of each of its member companies has the responsibility and authority to publish financial information that it regards as useful to the financial community 
accordingly  centerpoint calculates ffo  inclusive of fee income and industrial property sales net of accumulated depreciation of the company and its unconsolidated affiliates 
the company believes that ffo inclusive of cash gains better reflects recurring funds because the disposition of stabilized properties  and the recycling of capital and profits to new value added investments  is fundamental to the company s business strategy 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles gaap  should not be considered by the reader as an alternative to net income as an indicator of the company s operating performance or to cash flows as a measure of liquidity  and is not indicative of cash available to fund all cash flow needs

the total net increase in the company s owned warehouse industrial properties was million square feet of buildings or the company carefully monitors its investment  disposition and other operating activity to ensure its continuing qualification as a reit under applicable laws 
intended short term property investments  and other activities whose sale may have an adverse impact on the company s reit status are undertaken by the company s taxable reit subsidiary  centerpoint realty services  inc crs or other taxable affiliates of the company

also  as of the end of the year  the company or its affiliates had incurred an additional million of costs expected to be reimbursed through the issuance of additional tif notes 
centerpoint venture the company owns of centerpoint venture llc centerpoint venture or the venture  a partnership with caleast a joint venture between calpers and lasalle investment management  which was formed to position  package and sell stabilized industrial property investment opportunities routinely passed over by the company due to its more value added focus

the company earns development fees for construction related activities 
the buildings are leased to ford suppliers and construction is expected to be completed in the third quarter of the cmc venture benefits from tif and other governmental assistance 
critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which requires the company to make certain estimates and assumptions 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is provided in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following section is a summary of certain aspects of those accounting policies that require management estimates and judgment 
when real estate properties are acquired  acquisition costs are allocated to components of the property using relative fair values based on historical experience and the company s current judgment 
these assumptions and estimates impact the amount of costs allocated between land and different categories of building and land improvements  the amount of costs assigned to individual properties in multiple property acquisitions  depreciation expense  and gains or losses recorded on sales of properties 
for industrial park and multi phased developments  costs are assigned to individual components of the project when those costs benefit certain sites rather than the whole project 
where specific identification is impractical or costs incurred benefit the project as a whole  capitalized costs are allocated as follows site acquisition costs and all other common costs are allocated to each land parcel benefited based on the relative fair market value of each land parcel before construction 
site improvement and construction costs are allocated to individual units in the phase on the basis of relative sales value of each unit 
when allocation based on relative sales value is impractical  capitalized costs are allocated based on acreage 
in the event a parcel within a park development is sold prior to completion of the park  the cost of the sold parcel will reflect a pro rata allocation of future common costs 
receivables are reported net of an allowance for doubtful accounts and may be uncollectible in the future 
the company reviews its receivables regularly for potential collection problems in computing the allowance recorded against its receivables 
the company adds all accounts in doubt as specific additions to the reserve and adds a percentage of other outstanding items based on historical trends 
this review process requires the company to make certain judgments regarding collections that are inherently difficult to predict 
tif is a municipal financing and planning technique that is widely used to renovate declining areas or redevelop blighted areas while expanding a municipality s tax base 
tifs allow municipalities to make needed public and private improvements by promising to return all or a portion of the real estate tax increase generated by the improvements to the developer for a limited period of time 
this contract to pay the tax increment to the developer is usually documented in a redevelopment agreement between the city and the developer 
in situations where the developer provides the initial funding of these improvements  a corresponding developer note payable from the municipality to the developer is created in an amount equal to agreed upon funded eligible construction costs 
the notes may bear interest and repayment of the notes is  in all cases  dependent on the sufficiency of the increment raised during the repayment period 
in the course of business for certain development projects  the company has obtained tifs from municipalities in order to finance such improvements as streets  curbs  sidewalks  building demolition  land assemblage  site rehabilitation and other items permissible by law and the development agreement 
the company accounts for developer notes based on the facts and circumstances of the development  the terms of the redevelopment agreement and the deemed collectibility of the underlying tif 
as of december   the company has three developer notes outstanding one for the acre development at the sold chicago international produce market cipm  one for the  acre centerpoint intermodal center and one for the acres development at west touhy avenue  niles for an office development  which has been sold 
the total principal amount of developer notes held by the company at december  is million  of which million has been reserved against due to uncertainty over collection of the underlying taxes 
as of december   the company has expended and submitted for approval an additional million of costs for which it expects to receive additional tif notes 
in future periods  the company expects to invest an additional million for which it expects to receive additional tif notes

in cases of impairment  the asset will be reduced to its fair value based on the property s estimated discounted future cash flows 
the amount of the reduction is recorded as an operating expense  impairment of asset
