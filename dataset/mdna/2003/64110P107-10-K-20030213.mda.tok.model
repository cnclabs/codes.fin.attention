on december   the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of datachannel  inc  a washington corporation and a provider of enterprise portal solutions 
as a result of the acquisition  datachannel became a wholly owned subsidiary of the company 
the acquisition was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the assumed tangible net liabilities of approximately million was allocated to acquired technology  in process research and development  and goodwill in the amounts of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
subsequently  during the quarter ended september   the company recorded a charge of million classified as an impairment charge in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  to write down the remaining goodwill to its implied fair value of zero 
critical accounting policies and significant judgments and estimates netegrity s discussion and analysis of its financial condition and results of operations are based on the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements as well as the reported revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  accounts receivable reserves  marketable securities  valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill  income taxes and stock based compensation 
management bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the significant accounting policies that management believes are most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition the company s revenues have been primarily generated from the sale of perpetual licenses for its proprietary siteminder and dms renamed identityminder in the fourth quarter of products and services 
in the future  the company anticipates generating its revenue primarily from the sale of perpetual licenses for siteminder  identityminder  transactionminder and the provisioning products and services  as well as from new product offerings 
the company generates its services revenue from consulting and training services performed for customers and from maintenance and support services 
as described below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
management analyzes various factors  including a review of specific transactions  historical experience  credit worthiness of customers and current market and economic conditions 
changes in judgments based upon these factors could impact the timing and amount of revenue and cost recognized 
we generally license our software products on a perpetual basis 
we apply the provisions of statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  as amended by statement of position no 
 software revenue recognition  with respect to certain transactions  to all transactions involving the sale of software products 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been delivered  the fees are fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivable is reasonably assured 
this policy is applicable to all sales  including sales to resellers and end users 
the company does not offer a right of return on its products 
for all sales  we use either a binding purchase order or signed license agreement as evidence of an arrangement 
for arrangements with multiple obligations for example  product  undelivered maintenance and support  and training and consulting  we allocate revenue to each component of the arrangement using the residual value method based on the fair value of the undelivered elements 
we defer revenue from the arrangement equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance and support obligations are based upon separate sales of renewals of maintenance contracts 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based upon separate sales of these services to other customers 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with the transaction is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
if a significant portion of the fee is due after our normal payment terms  which are generally to days from invoice date  we account for the fee as not being fixed or determinable 
in these cases  we recognize revenue as the fees become due 
in addition  we assess whether collection is probable or not based on the credit worthiness of the customer 
initial credit worthiness is assessed through dun bradstreet or similar credit rating agencies 
credit worthiness for follow on transactions is assessed through a review of the transaction history with the customer 
we do not request collateral from our customers 
if we determine that collection of a fee is not reasonably assured  we defer the fee and recognize revenue at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally upon receipt of cash 
installation by netegrity is not considered essential to the functionality of our products as these services do not alter the product capabilities  do not require specialized skills and may be performed by the customer or other vendors 
revenues for maintenance and support are recognized ratably over the term of the support period 
revenues from consulting and training services are recognized as the services are performed 
accounts receivable reserves accounts receivable are reduced by an allowance for amounts that may become uncollectible in the future 
the estimated allowance for uncollectible amounts is based primarily on a specific analysis of accounts in the receivable portfolio and a general reserve based on the aging of receivables and historical write off experience 
while management believes the allowance to be adequate  if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required and could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
marketable securities investments  which primarily consist of debt securities  are accounted for under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities issued by the financial accounting standards board fasb 
pursuant to the provisions of sfas no 
 the company has classified its investment portfolio as trading  available for sale or held to maturity 
trading securities are bought and held principally for the purpose of selling them in the near term and are recorded at fair value 
fair value is based upon quoted market prices 
unrealized gains and losses on trading securities are included in the determination of net earnings 
available for sale securities include debt securities that are being held for an unspecified period of time and may be used for liquidity or other corporate purposes and are recorded at fair value 
unrealized gains and losses on available for sale securities are reported as a separate component of comprehensive income loss in stockholders equity 
held to maturity securities are debt securities that the company intends to hold to maturity and are recorded at amortized cost 
as of december   all of the company s investments have been classified as available for sale 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill effective january   the company adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas no 
 goodwill is required to be tested for impairment annually in lieu of being amortized 
furthermore  goodwill is required to be tested for impairment on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
an impairment loss shall be recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
impairment losses shall be recognized in operations 
the acquisition of datachannel  inc on december  was accounted for in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
and no 
the company adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of without a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
intangible assets other than goodwill that are not deemed to have indefinite lives are amortized over their useful lives 
the company chose to perform the annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of each fiscal year 
if the company had accounted for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas during the years ended december  and  the results of operations would not be materially different from those previously reported 
during the third quarter of  the company determined that a significant decline in our stock price as a result of underperformance relative to recent and expected operating results and the overall adverse change in the business climate had resulted in a triggering event that warranted an interim impairment review in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  the company tested for impairment based on a two step approach 
the first step was to test for indicators of impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of the company with its carrying value 
since the company operates as an enterprise wide reporting unit  it was determined that the market value of the company represented an approximation of its fair value as of september  furthermore  it was determined that the fair value of the company as of september  was less than its carrying value and therefore  an indication of impairment existed 
the second step was to measure the amount of the impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the second step  we determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill determined using the market capitalization of the company on september  was lower than its carrying value and therefore  goodwill had been impaired 
the company recorded a charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal  classified as impairment charge in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations  to write down goodwill to its implied fair value of zero 
the company reviews the valuation of long lived assets  including property and equipment and capitalized software  under the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the company is required to assess the recoverability of long lived assets and purchased software on an interim basis whenever events and circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important that could trigger an interim impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy of our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
in accordance with sfas no 
 when we determine that the carrying value of applicable long lived assets may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we evaluate whether the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of that asset 
if such a circumstance exists  we would measure an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount of the particular long lived asset or group exceeds its fair value 
we would determine the fair value based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
in accordance with sfas no 
 when we determine that the carrying value of certain other types of long lived assets may not be recoverable we evaluate whether the unamortized cost exceeds the expected future net realizable value of the products 
if the unamortized costs exceed the expected future net realizable value of the products  the excess amount is written off 
changes in judgments on any of these factors could impact the value of the asset being evaluated 
the company adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of fiscal year without a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
during the fourth quarter of  the company made the decision to remove certain technology acquired in the datachannel acquisition from its products 
it is expected that the first version of its products that do not include the portal technology will be released in august and will be the only version sold in the third quarter of as a result of this decision  the company determined that there has been a change in the estimated useful life of the acquired technology and therefore it is now appropriate to be amortized over a nine month period starting at the beginning of the fourth quarter the period during which the change in estimated life was identified 
prior to this change  the acquired technology long lived asset was being amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
therefore  the quarterly amortization increased from approximately  in each of the first three quarters of to approximately million in the fourth quarter of it is currently expected that the acquired technology will be fully amortized at the end of the second quarter of accounting for income taxes the preparation of our consolidated financial statements require us to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate  including those outside the united states which may be subject to certain risks that ordinarily would not be expected in the united states 
the income tax accounting process involves our estimating our actual current exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in the recognition of deferred tax assets and liabilities 
the company must then record a valuation allowance to reduce its deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against deferred tax assets 
the company has recorded a valuation allowance of million as of december   due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on our estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which we operate and the period over which our deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
in the event that actual results differ from these estimates or we adjust these estimates in future periods we may need to adjust our valuation allowance  which could materially impact our financial position and results of operations 
stock based compensation netegrity s stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program that is intended to contribute to the success of the company by attracting  retaining and motivating talented employees and to align employee interests with the interests of our existing stockholders 
stock options are typically granted to employees when they first join the company and typically on an annual basis thereafter 
stock options are also granted when there is a significant change in an employee s responsibilities and  occasionally  to achieve equity within a peer group 
the compensation committee of the board of directors may  however  grant additional options to executive officers and key employees for other reasons 
under the stock option plans  the participants may be granted options to purchase shares of netegrity stock and substantially all of our employees and directors participate in at least one of our plans 
options issued under these plans generally are granted at fair market value at the date of grant  become exercisable at varying rates  generally over three or four years and generally expire seven to ten years from the date of grant 
we recognize that stock options dilute existing shareholders and have attempted to control the number of options granted while remaining competitive with our compensation packages 
at december   approximately of our stock options had exercise prices in excess of the closing market price on that day 
all stock option grants are made after a review by  and with the approval of  the compensation committee of the board of directors 
all members of the compensation committee are independent directors  as defined in the applicable rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq stock market 
see the report of the compensation committee in our proxy statement for further information regarding the policies and procedures of netegrity and the compensation committee regarding the grant of stock options 
the company accounts for its stock option plans under the recognition and measurement principles of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based compensation cost is reflected in net income for these plans  as all options granted under these plans had an exercise price equal to the market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
the following table illustrates the effect on net income loss and earnings loss per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based compensation 
year ended december  net income loss  as reported    add stock based employee compensation expense included in reported net income loss  net of related tax effects    pro forma net loss    earnings loss per share basic as reported basic pro forma diluted as reported diluted pro forma the pro forma net loss for the years ended december  and includes the effects of options that were canceled by the company in connection with the tender offers described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the remaining unamortized pro forma compensation expense at the date of cancellation for these options in the amount of approximately million and million  respectively  is reflected as an expense in these pro forma amounts 
results of operations the following table presents statement of operations data as percentages of total revenues for the periods indicated years ended december  statement of operations data revenues software licenses services other total revenues cost of revenues cost of software licenses non cash cost of software licenses cost of services cost of other total cost of revenues gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses research and development expenses acquired in process research and development impairment charges restructuring and other non recurring expenses loss from operations other income  net income loss before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues decreased by million or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to decreases in software license revenues for the siteminder product  partially offset by an increase in service revenues and the impact of the acquisition of datachannel in december  which contributed approximately of total revenues in additionally  revenues in both europe and asia have continued to decline throughout overall  we believe that revenue growth will be modest over the next couple of quarters as constraints on technology spending continue 
however  we believe that the continued build out of the leveraged model with our partners and our focus on expanding our leadership position in the identity and access management market with our new product offerings will help to drive new account acquisition and increase deal size in the future 
software license revenues decreased by million or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the decrease is due to broad based economic weakness in all geographic regions and reduced technology spending  which resulted in deals being delayed or reduced in size 
the number of new name deals decreased from in to in and the average size of new name deals decreased from approximately  in to approximately  in the number of follow on deals also decreased from in to in and the average size of follow on deals decreased from approximately  in to approximately  in the primary reason for the decrease in deal size in was that customers bought licenses for a smaller number of users 
services revenues increased by million or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the increase is primarily attributable to an increase of million in in maintenance and support revenue resulting from maintenance renewals by our existing customer base and  to a lesser extent  the impact of the acquisition of datachannel in december  which contributed approximately of services revenues in the increase was partially offset by a decrease of million in in consulting and training revenue as a result of broad based economic weakness and decreased technology spending that resulted in a reduction in our customers need for installation and integration services and the company s decision to leverage its partners to provide integration services directly to our customers 
in connection with this leveraged model  the cumulative number of third party consultants the company had trained increased from approximately in to over  in other revenues decreased by million or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  other revenues are derived from the firewall legacy business 
this business has declined in and is not expected to have a significant impact in future periods 
cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues increased by million or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  our cost of revenues includes  among other things  royalties due to third parties for technology included in our products  amortization of acquired software  product fulfillment costs  salaries and related expenses for our consulting  education and technical support services organizations  and the associated cost of training facilities 
overall  we believe that the cost of revenues  and particularly the cost of software licenses  will increase over the short term primarily as a result of the cost of third party software products that enhance and enable additional functionality in our products  increased amortization of acquired technology due to an acceleration of the amortization period of the capitalized software  and increased investment in our technical support organization 
total cost of software license revenue  which includes non cash cost of software licenses  increased by million or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  this increase is primarily due to the amortization of purchased software recorded in connection with the acquisition of datachannel of approximately million  partially offset by a decrease in cost of license software in that is in relative proportion to the decrease in software license revenue 
during the fourth quarter of  the company accounted for a change in accounting estimates to reflect a change in the useful economic life of certain technology acquired in the datachannel acquisition in december prior to this change  the acquired technology long live asset was being amortized on a straight line basis over three years 
as a result of this change  beginning in the fourth quarter of  the acquired technology is being amortized over its current estimated useful life of nine months starting at the beginning of the quarter in which the change in estimated useful life was identified 
therefore  the quarterly amortization increased from approximately  in each of the first three quarters of to approximately million in the fourth quarter of it is currently expected that the acquired technology will be fully amortized by the end of the second quarter of cost of services decreased by million or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  the decrease is primarily due to the leveraging of our system integrator partner relationships 
the cumulative number of consultants we have trained at our affiliated partners increased from approximately in to over  in this leveraging allowed us to reduce the headcount in our professional services organization by over from december  to december  this decrease was partially offset by increased investment in the technical support organization during in order to enhance overall customer satisfaction 
cost of other revenues decreased by million or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease in cost of other revenues in is in relative proportion to the decrease in revenue in cost of other revenues is not expected to have a significant impact in future periods 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and other related costs for selling  administrative and marketing personnel  sales commissions  travel  legal and accounting services  public relations  marketing materials  trade shows and certain facilities related expenses 
the increase is primarily attributable to increased salaries and wages associated with the datachannel acquisition  increased legal expenses  consulting and accounting fees  marketing program costs and insurance expenses primarily directors and officer s insurance premiums and facility rent and depreciation expense primarily related to office space and fixed assets acquired from datachannel 
these increases were partially offset by reduced compensation and bonus expenses and as a result of recording reduced bad debt expense in the reduction in bad debt expense was primarily due to improved credit reviews  strong cash collections and fewer write offs than anticipated 
we will continue to scrutinize all discretionary expenses and evaluate reductions in non strategic programs 
in the immediate future  we anticipate selling  general and administrative expenses will decrease slightly as we realize the economic impact of the restructuring initiatives completed during research and development costs 
research and development costs increased by million or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and outside contractor costs to support product development 
the increase was primarily due to the addition of approximately employees including from the acquisition of datachannel in the fourth quarter of  the increased use of approximately contractors in india between and and other incremental expenses associated with the research and development of our new product offerings which were released for general availability during the fourth quarter of the increase was partially offset by the reduction of approximately employees during  primarily as a result of the company s decision in the fourth quarter to stop developing  marketing or selling its portal product 
we believe that our investment in research and development is required to remain competitive and therefore  expect that research and development expenses may increase in future periods due to the continued development of our products and services 
impairment charges 
impairment charges recorded in the year ended december  were million 
there were no impairment charges recorded in the year ended december  in the third quarter of  management determined that a significant decline in our stock price as a result of underperformance relative to recent and expected operating results and the overall adverse change in the business climate had resulted in a triggering event that warranted an interim impairment review in accordance with sfas no 
as a result  the company tested for impairment based on a two step approach 
the first step was to test for indicators of impairment of goodwill by comparing the fair value of the company with its carrying value 
since the company operates as an enterprise wide reporting unit  it was determined that the market value of the company represents an approximation of its fair value as of september  furthermore  it was determined that the fair value of the company as of september  was less than its carrying value and therefore  an indication of impairment existed 
the second step was to measure the amount of the impairment of goodwill 
as a result of the second step  we determined that the implied fair value of the goodwill determined using the market capitalization of the company on september  was lower than its carrying value and therefore  goodwill had been impaired 
the company has recorded a charge of million in the third quarter of fiscal  classified as impairment charge in the consolidated statements of operations  to write down goodwill to its implied fair value of zero 
acquired in process research and development 
in the year ended december   we recorded non recurring charges of million or of total revenue for acquired in process research and development resulting from the acquisition of datachannel 
this amount was expensed on the date of acquisition because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
there can be no assurance that acquisitions of businesses  products or technologies by us in the future will not result in substantial charges for acquired in process research and development 
such charges may cause fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results 
restructuring and other non recurring expenses 
in the year ended december   the company  as a result of changing market dynamics and economic factors  reduced its workforce through restructurings by approximately positions  or 
the reductions in workforce were primarily in the development group as well as in the sales and services departments  both domestically and internationally 
the majority of the reductions in the development group were concurrent with the company s decision to stop developing  marketing or selling its portal product 
as a result of the restructurings  the company recorded restructuring charges  which related primarily to severance payments and the closing of several sales offices  of approximately million during the year ended december  approximately million was paid as of december  the remainder is expected to be paid prior to march  during  the company reduced its workforce by approximately in order to reduce expenses and realign its cost structure 
the reductions in workforce were primarily in the sales  development and general and administrative groups 
the company recorded a charge of  during the year ended december   for severance payments and the consolidation of excess facilities 
additionally  the company recorded non recurring charges of  during the year ended december  primarily attributable to a contribution to the james hayden memorial fund  established in the memory of the company s former chief financial officer  and the acceleration of  of his options that would have vested by december  other income 
other income decreased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to declines in the both the balances of and interest rates for cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities 
provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was approximately  compared with a provision of approximately  for the year ended december  this decrease relates to federal alternative minimum taxes  and larger state taxes and foreign taxes in the provision for the year ended december  differs from the expected tax rate due to nondeductible goodwill impairment and an increase in the company s valuation allowance 
as of december   we had a deferred tax asset related to net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million  against which a full valuation allowance has been provided  available for federal purposes to reduce future taxable income expiring on various dates through of the million of net operating loss carryforwards  million is attributable to tax deductions relating to stock options and million is related to the acquisition of datachannel 
the benefit of the stock option deductions included in the net operating loss carryforward will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized or recognized 
the benefit of the acquired net operating loss carryforward will first reduce non current intangible assets and the remaining will be recorded to reduce income tax expense 
the acquired loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation under internal revenue code section of approximately million 
under the tax reform act of  the utilization of a corporation s net operating loss carryforward is limited following a greater than change in ownership over a three year period 
as of december   no change in ownership has occurred  although such a change can occur in a future period 
if a change occurs  it could substantially limit the utilization of the loss carryforwards of the company 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
total revenues increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  software license revenues increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase was due to the continued increase in market awareness and the acceptance of the siteminder product  the expansion of our sales organization and the leveraging of our strategic partner relationships 
for the year ended december   the company added new siteminder software customers 
service revenues increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase was attributable to maintenance and services arrangements for a growing customer base coupled with increasing demand to provide installation and integration services for our new customers 
other revenues remained relatively unchanged at million for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  cost of revenues 
total cost of revenues increased by million or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  cost of software licenses decreased by million  or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to favorable revisions of royalty contracts with third party licensors slightly offset by increases in amortization on acquired software 
cost of services increased by million or  to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to increases in payroll and related personnel expenses for our consulting and training organizations as a result of increased siteminder service revenues 
during  the company opened a technical service center in kuala lumpur  malaysia 
cost of other revenue remained relatively unchanged at million in the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this increase was attributable to several factors 
approximately million including million related to the datachannel acquisition  or  of this increase relates to increased payroll and related costs including the addition of approximately employees in the sales and marketing organization of the company during and the full year effect of approximately employees hired during the second half of fiscal year and million  or  in costs for additional administrative support personnel 
approximately million  or  of the increase relates to increased costs for promotional initiatives including attendance at trade shows  advertising  public relations and related printing and postage expenses 
approximately million  or  of the increase relates to increases in rent  telephone and travel related expenses primarily attributable to adding sales and marketing personnel and the opening of additional sales offices in the pacific rim and europe 
approximately million  or  of the increase relates to increases in depreciation and amortization connected with the company s growth 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses increased by million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  approximately million  or  of this increase was related to the addition of approximately employees including related to the datachannel acquisition in the research and development organization during and the full year effect of approximately employees hired during the second half of fiscal year to support continued development of siteminder  dms and other related products 
the remaining increase relates to increased general expenses in support of the additional head count added to research and development for the year ended december  acquired in process research and development 
in the year ended december   we recorded non recurring charges of million or of total revenue for acquired in process research and development resulting from the acquisition of datachannel 
this amount was expensed on the date of acquisition because the acquired technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no future alternative uses 
restructuring and other non recurring expenses 
in the year ended december   we recorded other non recurring charges of approximately  or less than of total revenue for expenses associated with the company s restructuring plan and other non recurring expenses 
other income 
other income decreased by approximately million  or  to million in the year ended december   from million in the year ended december  this decrease was primarily attributable to declines in interest rates for cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities coupled with larger foreign currency translation losses during the year ended december  provision for income taxes 
provision for income taxes for the year ended december  was  compared with a provision of  for the year ended december  this increase relates to federal alternative minimum taxes  state taxes and foreign taxes 
the provision for the year ended december  differs from the expected tax rates due to nondeductible acquired in process research and development expenses offset by a reduction in the company s valuation allowance 
as of december   we had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million  against which a full valuation allowance has been provided  available for federal and state purposes to reduce future taxable income expiring on various dates through of the million of net operating loss carryforwards  million is attributable to tax deductions relating to stock options and million is related to the acquisition of datachannel 
the benefit of the stock option deductions included in the net operating loss carryforward will be credited to additional paid in capital when realized 
the benefit of the acquired net operating loss carryforward will reduce goodwill when realized 
under the tax reform act of  the utilization of a corporation s net operating loss carryforward is limited following a greater than change in ownership over a three year period 
as a result of the datachannel acquisition million of the net operating loss carryforwards are subject to an annual limitation of approximately million 
liquidity and capital resources cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  was million  primarily due to a net loss of million  a decrease in accrued expenses including approximately million in payments made in connection with the december acquisition of datachannel  and a decrease in accrued compensation and benefits  offset by non cash charges for depreciation  amortization and impairment of million  a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenue 
cash provided by investing activities was million for the year ended december  investing activities for the year consisted primarily of net sales and maturities of marketable securities of approximately million  offset by the purchases of marketable securities of approximately million  and the purchase of approximately million of property and equipment  primarily computer related  and leasehold improvements for the new corporate headquarters 
cash provided by financing activities in the year ended december  was approximately  primarily related to the exercise of stock options and issuance of shares in connection with the employee stock purchase plan 
as of december   our primary financial commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under operating leases as well as potential royalty payments to certain system integrators 
the company has commitments that expire at various times through operating leases shown below are primarily for facility costs for the company s corporate headquarters and world wide sales offices 
other contractual obligations primarily consist of minimum royalty fees payable by the company in connection with a software license and distribution agreement which the company entered into in january other operating contractual years ending december  leases obligations total thereafter included in the operating lease commitments above is approximately million related to excess facilities which have been accrued in purchase accounting 
in april  the company entered into an agreement with a system integrator to assist the company in the development and launch of one of its products 
under the terms of the agreement  for consideration of the system integrator s time in assisting with the development of the product  the company agreed to promote the system integrator as an integrator of the developed product 
the company s obligation under the agreement will be considered satisfied once the system integrator receives consulting revenues totaling approximately million from the company s customers  or by april  whichever occurs first 
in the event that the company recommends a competitor of the system integrator to perform the integration work for a customer  the company could potentially owe a royalty to the system integrator based on the net license fee 
as of december  no royalties were due under this agreement to the system integrator 
in august  the company entered into a five year non cancelable operating lease for an office building for its corporate headquarters 
the company anticipates moving to the new facility in march in connection with the lease agreement  the company delivered an irrevocable  unconditional  negotiable letter of credit in the amount of  as a security deposit 
the company anticipates that it will spend approximately million in leasehold improvements to build out the new facility 
as of december   approximately  had been spent 
the company has entered into indemnification agreements with the non employee members of its board of directors 
additionally  the company has entered into employment and executive retention agreements with certain employees and executive officers which  among other things  include certain severance and change of control provisions 
under the terms of the company s standard software license contracts  the company indemnifies its customers for the potential liability associated with the infringement of other parties technology based upon the company s software products 
there is a possibility that the company may be liable to its customers in the event that there is infringement occurring 
the company is not aware of any infringement related to the company s technology  and therefore has not accrued any amounts for the replacement or refund of any software products sold through december  in january  the company entered into a software license and distribution agreement under which the company was granted the right to sublicense the use of a provisioning application software program 
in addition  the company was granted certain rights to integrate or combine the software into its existing products 
in exchange for these rights  the company has agreed to pay a quarterly royalty fee based on a percentage of the net license fees charged by netegrity for the software 
the minimum royalty fees due in the first  second and third years of the agreement are approximately million  million and million 
the initial term of this agreement is three years 
as of december   we had cash and cash equivalents totaling million  short term marketable securities of approximately million and working capital of million 
any increase or decrease in our accounts receivable balance and accounts receivable days outstanding calculated as net accounts receivable divided by revenue per day will affect our cash flow from operations and liquidity 
our accounts receivable and accounts receivable days outstanding may increase due to changes in factors such as the timing of when sales are invoiced and length of customer s payment cycle 
we also record deferred maintenance billings as accounts receivable  and the timing of these billings affects the accounts receivable days outstanding 
historically  international and indirect customers pay at a slower rate than domestic and direct customers 
an increase in revenue generated from international and indirect customers may increase our accounts receivable days outstanding and accounts receivable balance 
due to the current economic climate  we may observe an increase in the length of our customers payment cycle 
to the extent that our accounts receivable balance increases  we may incur increased bad debt expense and will be subject to greater general credit risks 
in the past  we experienced a period of rapid growth which resulted in significant increases in our operating expenses 
more recently  due to economic conditions beyond our control  we have made considerable efforts to reduce our operating expenses through constrained spending and reductions in workforce 
we anticipate that we will realize a reduction in our operating expenses in the immediate future as we experience the benefits of the reductions in force  the changes in facilities and continued cost containment efforts 
while we anticipate that our operating expenses and capital expenditures will constitute a material use of our cash resources  we may also utilize cash resources to fund acquisitions or investments in businesses  technologies  products or services that are complementary to our business 
we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalent balances together with our marketable securities will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
related party transactions loan to officer the consolidated balance sheets as of december  and include  and  respectively  in loans to an officer of the company issued in connection with the exercise of stock options in the loan is reflected as a reduction of stockholders equity in the accompanying consolidated balance sheets statements 
the loan is payable upon demand and bears interest at per annum 
the loan was originally represented by a secured note however  in may  the note was amended such that it became a full recourse note 
during the fourth quarter of  the officer repaid approximately  of the loan balance and repaid an advance made during of approximately  marketing services during the years ended december   and  the company paid approximately   and  respectively  to a company for marketing services 
the principal shareholder of such company  is the son in law of one of the members of our board of directors 
the company has similar arrangements with other marketing services firms and believes the arrangement was entered into on substantially the same terms and conditions as its arrangements with such other firms 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after june   be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
sfas no 
discusses how intangible assets that are acquired should be accounted for in financial statements upon their acquisition 
in addition  under sfas no 
 goodwill and other indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed at least annually for impairment or more frequently if impairment indicators arise 
separable intangible assets that are not deemed to have indefinite lives will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
the acquisition discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements included in this report was accounted for in accordance with the transition provisions of sfas no 
and no 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill will be tested at least annually and on an interim basis if an event or circumstance indicates that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
we currently operate as a single reporting unit and all of our goodwill is associated with the entire company 
a transitional impairment test was performed on january  see note to the consolidated financial statements regarding the impairment of goodwill recorded during the quarter ended september  in october  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is effective for the company on january  sfas no 
addresses accounting and reporting of certain long lived assets  except goodwill  that are either held and used or disposed of through sale or other means 
the company adopted sfas no s 
 and no 
during the first quarter of without a material impact on its financial position or results of operations 
if the company had accounted for goodwill and other intangibles in accordance with sfas during the period ended september   the results of operations would not be materially different from those previously reported 
in november  the emerging issues task force issued topic no 
d topic d  subsequently recharacterized as eitf  relating to the accounting for reimbursements received from customers for the company s out of pocket expenses for the delivery of services 
in accordance with eitf  reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred should be characterized as revenue in the statement of operations 
the company has historically accounted for reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred as a reduction to the cost of service revenues in the statement of operations to offset the costs incurred 
the company adopted eitf effective january  and reclassified approximately million  million and  into revenues from cost of revenues for the years ended december   and  respectively  to comply with this guidance 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit of disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
this statement is effective for restructuring activities commencing after december  we do not believe that the impact of adopting sfas no 
will have a material impact on the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which clarifies disclosure and recognition measurement requirements related to certain guarantees 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements issued after december  and the recognition measurement requirements are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees issued or modified after december  the application of the requirements of fin did not have a material impact on the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  as the company did not make a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation in  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on the company s financial position and results of operations 
certain factors that may affect future results the private securities litigation reform act of contains certain safe harbors regarding forward looking statements 
in that context  the discussion in this item and other portions of this report contain forward looking statements that involve certain degrees of risk and uncertainty  including statements relating to our business  liquidity and capital resources 
except for the historical information contained herein  the matters discussed in this section are such forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including we have incurred substantial losses and may not be profitable in the future 
in recent years  we have incurred substantial operating losses 
we cannot predict if we will achieve profitability for any substantial period of time 
to achieve and sustain operating profitability on a quarterly and annual basis  we will need to increase our revenues significantly  particularly our license revenues 
failure to maintain levels of profitability as expected by investors may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
in the year ended december   we had a net loss of million and an accumulated deficit of approximately million as of december  our quarterly results may fluctuate widely 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to predict and may continue to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter for several reasons  including  but not limited to  the following customers choosing to delay their purchase commitments or purchase in smaller than expected quantities due to a general slowdown in the economy or in anticipation of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  market acceptance of our siteminder  identityminder  transactionminder  provisioning products and related products  our success in obtaining follow on sales to existing customers  the long sales and deployment cycle of our products  our ability to hire and retain personnel  particularly in development  services and sales and marketing  the loss of or changes in key management personnel  the timing of the release of new versions of siteminder  identityminder  transactionminder  provisioning products or other products  pricing pressures that result in increased discounts  the development of our direct and indirect sales channels  and integration issues with acquired technology 
in addition  because our revenues from services are largely correlated with our software revenues  a decline in software revenues could also cause a decline in our services revenues in the same quarter or in subsequent quarters 
other factors  many of which are outside our control  could also cause variations in our quarterly revenues and operating results 
most of our expenses  such as employee compensation and rent  are relatively fixed 
moreover  our expense levels are based  in part  on our expectations regarding future revenue increases 
as a result  any shortfall in revenues in relation to our expectations could cause significant changes in our operating results from quarter to quarter and could result in future losses 
our success will depend on our ability to market our products and related services successfully 
to date  we have derived the majority of our total revenues from the sale of siteminder software licenses and related products and services 
commercial deployments of siteminder products have grown to include not only large intranet and multi million user business to consumer deployments  but business to business and e business applications as well 
broad market acceptance of our products will depend on the development of a market for identity and access management  usage of our products for software business to consumer  business to business and e business applications and customer demand for the specific functionality of our products 
market acceptance for our products  and customer demand for the services they provide  may not develop 
in addition  we have recently released several new product offerings 
if we fail to gain market acceptance for these products  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial position 
our ability to develop the market for our products depends in part on our ability to provide support services on a hour per day  seven day per week basis 
any damage or disruptions to our service centers  including the service center in malaysia  whether as a result of terrorism or some other cause  could seriously impact our ability to provide the necessary service to our customers and fulfill our service contracts 
our success is dependent on our ability to enhance our product lines and develop new products 
we believe our success is dependent  in large part  on our ability to enhance and broaden our product lines to meet the evolving needs of both the business to business and business to consumer markets 
we may be unable to respond effectively to technological changes or new industry standards or developments 
although we recently released two new products on time  product development cycles are unpredictable and in the past  we have delayed the introduction of several new product versions due to delays in development of these versions 
in the future  we could be adversely affected and be at a competitive disadvantage if we incur significant delays or are unsuccessful in enhancing our product lines or developing new products  or if any of our enhancements or new products do not gain market acceptance 
our performance depends on our ability to win business and obtain follow on sales in profitable segments 
customers typically place small initial orders for a netegrity product installation to allow them to evaluate its performance 
a key element of our strategy is to pursue more significant follow on sales after these initial installations 
our financial performance depends on successful initial deployments of our products that  in turn  lead to follow on sales 
if the initial deployments of our products are not successful  we may be unable to obtain follow on sales 
in addition  even if initial deployments are successful  there can be no assurances that customers will choose to make follow on purchases  which could have a material adverse effect on our ability to generate revenues 
we face significant competition from other technology companies and we may not be able to compete effectively 
the market for identity and access management is highly competitive 
we expect the level of competition to increase as a result of the anticipated growth of the identity and access management markets 
our primary competitor in the identity and access management market is the tivoli division of ibm 
we also compete against traditional security companies such as oblix  rsa  novell  waveset and open network technology 
in addition  a number of other security and software companies have indicated that they plan to offer products that may compete with our identity and access management solution in the future 
competition may also develop as the market matures and other companies begin to offer similar products  and as our product offerings expand to other segments of the marketplace 
we also face competition from web development professional services organizations 
we expect that additional competitors will emerge in the future 
current and potential competitors have established  or may in the future establish  cooperative selling relationships with third parties to increase the distribution of their products to the marketplace 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors may emerge and acquire significant market share 
it is possible that current and potential competitors may attempt to hire our employees and although we have non compete agreements in place with most of our employees they may or may not be enforceable 
it is possible that new competitors or alliances may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
today  many of our competitors have shorter operating histories  and fewer financial and technical resources than we have 
in addition  these smaller competitors have smaller customer bases 
some of our other competitors  however  are larger companies who have large financial resources  well established development and support teams  and large customer bases 
these larger competitors may initiate pricing policies that would make it more difficult for us to maintain our competitive position against these companies 
it is also possible that current and potential competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies or customer requirements  resulting in increased market share 
if  in the future  a competitor chooses to bundle a competing point product with other applications within a suite  the demand for our products might be substantially reduced 
because of these factors  many of which are out of our control  we may be unable to maintain or enhance our competitive position against current and future competitors 
regulations or consumer concerns regarding the use of cookies on the internet could reduce the effectiveness of our software products 
certain of our products use cookies to support their single sign on functionality 
a cookie is information keyed to a specific user that is stored on the hard drive of the user s computer  typically without the user s knowledge 
cookies are generally removable by the user  and can be refused by the user at the point at which the information would be stored on the user s hard drive 
a number of governmental bodies and commentators in the united states and abroad have urged passage of laws limiting or abolishing the use of cookies 
the passage of laws limiting or abolishing the use of cookies  or the widespread deletion or refusal of cookies by web site users  could reduce or eliminate the effectiveness of our single sign on functionality and could reduce market demand for our products 
we may be unable to hire and retain skilled personnel 
qualified personnel are in great demand throughout the software industry 
our success depends  in large part  upon our ability to attract  train  motivate and retain highly skilled employees  particularly software engineers  professional services personnel  sales and marketing personnel and other senior personnel 
our failure to attract and retain the highly trained technical personnel that are integral to our product development  professional services and direct sales teams may limit the rate at which we can generate sales and develop new products or product enhancements 
a change in key management  particularly in the sales and product development departments  such as the recent appointment of thomas thimot  vice president of worldwide sales and services  could result in transition and attrition in the affected department 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our success depends on our ability to optimize our direct sales and indirect distribution channels 
to increase our revenues  we must optimize our direct sales force and continue to enhance relationships with systems integrators and technology partners to increase the leverage of our partner channel 
there is intense competition for sales personnel in our business  and we cannot be sure that we will be successful in attracting  integrating  motivating and retaining sales personnel 
in addition  we must effectively leverage our relationships with our strategic partners and other third party system integrators  vendors of internet related systems and application software and resellers 
our existing  or future  channel partners may choose to devote greater resources to marketing and supporting the products of other companies or conflicts may develop among our sales force and channel partners 
if we fail to develop these relationships or these relationships do not result in successful partnerships  our revenue could be adversely affected 
we rely on third party technology to enhance our products 
we incorporate into our products software licensed from third party software companies that enhances  enables or provides functionality for our products 
third party software may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms or with acceptable levels of support or functionality  or at all 
failure to maintain those license arrangements  failure of the third party vendors to provide updates  modifications or future versions of their software or defects and errors in or infringement claims against those third party products could delay or impair our ability to develop and sell our products 
in addition  often these third party software companies require prepayment of royalties on their products and in the past  we have had to write off certain of these prepayments when there has been an adverse change in forecasted sales volume 
our failure to expand our relationship with global systems integrators could limit our ability to increase our product sales 
our professional services organization and our relationship with global systems integrators provide critical support to our customers installation and deployment of our products 
if we fail to adequately develop our relationship with global systems integrators  our ability to increase products sales may be limited 
in addition  if we or our partners cannot adequately support product installations  our customers may not be able to use our products which could harm our reputation and hurt our business 
our lengthy sales cycle makes it difficult to predict our quarterly operating results 
we have a long sales cycle because we generally need to educate potential customers regarding the use and benefits of our products 
the length of our sales cycle varies depending on the size and type and complexity of the customer contemplating a purchase  whether we have conducted business with a potential customer in the past and the size of the deal 
in addition  these potential customers frequently need to obtain approvals from multiple decision makers prior to making purchase decisions  a process that has been further lengthened as a result of the current market conditions surrounding technology spending 
our long sales cycle  which can range from several weeks to several months or more  makes it difficult to predict the quarter in which sales will occur 
delays in sales could cause significant variability in our revenues and operating results for any particular quarterly period 
our failure to effectively manage changes in the business environment in which we operate could hurt our business 
our failure to effectively manage changes in the business environment in which we operate could have a material adverse effect on the quality of our products  our ability to retain key personnel and our business  operating results and financial condition 
historically  we experienced a period of rapid growth that placed a significant strain on all of our resources 
more recently  based upon economic factors beyond our control  we implemented a reduction in workforce of positions during april and positions during october we may experience similar changes in the future 
to effectively manage changes in the business environment in which we operate we must maintain and enhance our financial and accounting systems and controls  maintain our ability to retain key personnel  integrate new personnel and manage operations 
if we lose the services of barry bycoff or any other member of our management team  our business could suffer 
our future success depends  to a significant degree  on the skill  experience and efforts of barry bycoff  our chief executive officer  and the rest of our management team 
a change in our management team or the inability of our officers and key employees to work effectively as a team could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
as we continue to operate in international markets  we will face continued risks to our success 
at the current time  we have no plans to significantly expand beyond our current international operations 
however  if in the future we decide to expand our international operations  the expansion will require additional resources and management attention  and will subject us to increased regulatory  economic and political risks 
we have limited experience in international markets and we cannot be sure that our continued expansion into global markets will be successful 
in addition  we will face increased risks in conducting business internationally 
these risks could reduce demand for our products and services  increase the prices at which we can sell our products and services  or otherwise have an adverse effect on our operating results 
among the risks we believe are most likely to affect us are longer decision making cycles  longer payment cycles and problems in collecting accounts receivable  adverse changes in trade and tax regulations  including restrictions on the import and export of sensitive technologies  such as encryption technologies  that we use or may wish to use in our software products  the absence or significant lack of legal protection for intellectual property rights  selling under contracts governed by local law  difficulties in managing an organization spread over several countries  including complications arising from cultural  language and time differences that may lengthen sales and implementation cycles  currency risks  including fluctuations in exchange rates  political and economic instability  localization of technology  increased use of contractors on a global basis for both professional services and development  that may result in increased cost of services and or less direct control  and disruption caused by terrorist activities in various regions around the world 
our success depends on our ability to protect our proprietary rights 
our success depends to a significant degree upon the protection of our software and other proprietary technology 
the unauthorized reproduction or other misappropriation of our proprietary technology could enable third parties to benefit from our technology without paying us for it 
this could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we depend upon a combination of patent  trademark  trade secret and copyright laws  license agreements and non disclosure and other contractual provisions to protect proprietary and distribution rights in our products 
in addition  we attempt to protect our proprietary information and the proprietary information of our vendors and partners through confidentiality and or license agreements with our employees and others 
although we have taken steps to protect our proprietary technology  they may be inadequate and the unauthorized use of our source code could have an adverse effect on our business 
existing trade secret  copyright and trademark laws offer only limited protection 
moreover  the laws of other countries in which we market our products may afford little or no effective protection of our intellectual property 
if we resort to legal proceedings to enforce our intellectual property rights  the proceedings could be burdensome and expensive  even if we were to prevail 
claims by other companies that we infringe their proprietary technology could hurt our financial condition 
if we discover that any of our products or third party products embedded in our products violates third party proprietary rights  there can be no assurance that we would be able to reengineer our product or to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms to continue offering the product without substantial reengineering 
we do not conduct comprehensive patent searches to determine whether the technology used in our products infringes patents held by third parties 
in addition  product development is inherently uncertain in a rapidly evolving technology environment in which there may be numerous patent applications pending for similar technologies  many of which are confidential when filed 
any claim of infringement  even if invalid  could cause us to incur substantial costs defending against the claim and could distract our management from our business 
furthermore  a party making such a claim could secure a judgment that requires us to pay substantial damages 
a judgment could also include an injunction or other court order that could prevent us from selling our products 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
our business could be adversely affected if our products contain errors 
software products as complex as ours may contain undetected errors or bugs that result in product failures 
the occurrence of errors could result in loss of  or delay in  revenues  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  injury to our reputation  or damage to our efforts to build brand awareness  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
we could incur substantial costs resulting from product liability claims relating to our customers use of our products 
many of the e business applications supported by our products are critical to the operations of our customers businesses 
any failure in a customer s web site or application caused or allegedly caused by our products could result in a claim for substantial damages against us  regardless of our responsibility for the failure 
although we maintain general liability insurance  including coverage for errors and omissions  and contractually attempt to limit liability  we cannot be sure that our existing coverage will continue to be available on reasonable terms or will be available in amounts sufficient to cover one or more large claims  or that the insurer will not disclaim coverage as to any future claim 
increased utilization and costs of our technical support services may adversely affect our financial results 
our products involve very complex technology and the failure or inability of our technical support staff to meet customer expectations in a timely manner or customer dissatisfaction with our product functionality or performance could result in loss of revenues  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  injury to our reputation  liability for service or warranty costs and claims and other increased costs 
we may be unable to respond to fluctuations in customer demand for support services as well as resolve customer issues in a manner that is timely and satisfactory to them 
we also may be unable to modify the format of our support services to compete with changes in support services provided by competitors 
our acquisition of other companies may increase the risks we face 
in the future  we may pursue acquisitions to obtain complementary products  services and technologies 
any such acquisition may not produce the revenues  earnings or business synergies that we anticipated  and an acquired product  service or technology might not perform as we expected 
in pursuing any acquisition  our management could spend a significant amount of time and effort in identifying and completing the acquisition 
if we complete an acquisition  we would probably have to devote a significant amount of management resources to integrate the acquired business with our existing business 
to pay for an acquisition  we might use our stock or cash 
alternatively  we might borrow money from a bank or other lender 
if we use our stock  our stockholders would experience dilution of their ownership interests 
if we use cash or debt financing  our financial liquidity will be reduced 
the market price of our common stock has been and may continue to be volatile 
our stock price  like that of other technology companies  has been extremely volatile 
the announcement of new products  services  technological innovations  customers or distribution partners by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our operating results  changes in revenues or earnings estimates by securities analysts  speculation in the press or investment community and overall economic conditions are among the factors affecting our stock price 
in addition  the stock market in general and the market prices for technology companies in particular  have experienced extreme volatility that often has been unrelated to the operating performance of these companies 
these broad market and industry fluctuations may adversely affect the market price of our common stock  regardless of our operating performance 
recently  when the market price of a stock has been volatile  holders of that stock have often instituted securities class action litigation against the company that issued the stock 
if any of our stockholders brought a lawsuit against us  we could incur substantial costs defending the lawsuit 
the lawsuit could also divert the time and attention of our management 
the general economic uncertainties in the united states and abroad continue to cause significant volatility in the stock markets 
the continued threat of terrorism in the united states and abroad  the ongoing military action and heightened security measures undertaken in response to that threat can be expected to cause continued volatility in securities markets 
in addition  foreign political unrest may continue to adversely affect the economy 
we may lose money on fixed price consulting contracts 
in the future  an increased portion of our services revenues may be derived from fixed price contracts 
we work with complex technologies in compressed time frames and it can be difficult to judge the time and resources necessary to complete a project 
if we miscalculate the resources or time we need to complete work under fixed price contracts  our operating results could be materially harmed 
currently  the company does not have any outstanding fixed price consulting contracts 
certain provisions of our charter and of delaware law make a takeover of our company more difficult 
our corporate documents and delaware law contain provisions that might enable our management to resist a takeover of our company 
these provisions might discourage  delay or prevent a change in the control of netegrity or a change in our management 
these provisions could also discourage proxy contests and make it more difficult for you and other stockholders to elect directors and take other corporate actions 
the existence of these provisions could limit the price that investors might be willing to pay in the future for shares of our common stock 
additionally  the company has entered into employment and executive retention agreements with certain employees and executive officers which  among other things  include certain severance and change of control provisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency in the year ended december   the company generated approximately of its revenues outside of north america 
international sales are typically denominated in us dollars 
our foreign subsidiaries incur most of their expenses in the local currency 
accordingly  all foreign subsidiaries use the local currency as their functional currency 
translation gains and losses amounting to a loss of approximately  as of december  are deferred and accumulated as a separate component of stockholders equity accumulated other comprehensive income loss 
net gains and losses resulting from foreign exchange transactions  amounting to a gain of approximately  for the year ended december   are included in other income  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
a change in the valuation of the functional currencies relative to the us dollar as of december  would not have a material impact on the company s results of operations for the year ended december  interest rates we invest our cash in a variety of financial instruments including floating rate bonds  municipal bonds  asset backed securities and money market instruments in accordance with an investment policy approved by the company s board of directors 
these investments are denominated in us dollars 
cash balances in foreign currencies overseas are operating balances and are only invested in short term deposits of the local operating bank 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate interest earning instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
however  due to the conservative nature of our investment portfolio  a sudden change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the value of the portfolio 
we estimate that if the average yield of our investments had decreased by basis points  our interest income for the year ended december  would have decreased by less than million 
this estimate assumes that the decrease occurred on the first day of the year and reduced the yield of each investment instrument by basis points 
the same basis point change in interest rates would not have a material impact on the fair value of the investment portfolio 
the impact on our future interest income and future changes in investment yields will depend largely on the gross amount of our investment portfolio
