item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and the related notes 
except for historical information  the discussion in this report contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  such as statements of our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
the cautionary statements made in this report should be read as applying to all related forward looking statements wherever they appear in this report 
our actual results could differ materially from those discussed here 
factors that could cause or contribute to these differences include those discussed in factors affecting operating results below as well as those discussed elsewhere 
overview we design  manufacture  and market the da vinci surgical system  an advanced surgical system that we believe represents a new generation of surgery 
the da vinci surgical system consists of a surgeon s console  a patient side cart  a high performance vision system and proprietary instruments 
the da vinci surgical system seamlessly translates the surgeon s natural hand movements on instrument controls at a console into corresponding micro movements of instruments positioned inside the patient through small puncture incisions  or ports 
we believe that the da vinci surgical system is the only commercially available technology that can provide the surgeon with the intuitive control  range of motion  fine tissue manipulation capability and d visualization characteristic of open surgery  while simultaneously allowing the surgeon to work through the small ports of minimally invasive surgery  or mis 
by placing computer enhanced technology between the surgeon and the patient  we believe that the da vinci surgical system enables surgeons to perform better surgery while giving patients the benefits of mis  including decreased trauma and postoperative pain  reduced surgical complications  shorter hospital stays and lower total treatment costs 
in  we obtained permission from the european union to affix the ce mark to the da vinci surgical system and endowrist instruments for general surgical and cardiac surgical use 
based on this approval  we recognized revenue for the first time in the second quarter of for the sale of our products 
in july  we received clearance from the us food and drug administration  or fda  to begin commercialization of our da vinci surgical system in the united states for use in laparoscopic surgical procedures 
in march  we received clearance from the fda for use of our da vinci surgical system in non cardiac thoracoscopic surgical procedures 
in may  we received market clearance from the fda to promote use of the da vinci surgical system for performance of laparoscopic radical prostatectomy procedures 
in november  we received clearance from the fda for use of the da vinci surgical system in thoracoscopically assisted cardiotomy procedures 
in january  we began promoting atrial septal defect closure surgery under the november cardiotomy clearance 
to date  the majority of our revenues have come from the sales of the da vinci surgical system  which are high revenue dollar items 
a smaller percentage of revenues have come from sales of endowrist instruments and accessories  which are lower revenue dollar items 
a small percentage of revenue also comes from ongoing service of installed da vinci surgical systems 
although we expect the majority of our revenues to continue to come from the sale of da vinci surgical systems over the next few years  we believe that the percentage of revenue from our endowrist instruments and service will continue to increase 
due to the high dollar revenue per system sold  small variations in system unit sales may cause revenue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
during the useful life of each installed da vinci surgical system  we expect to generate recurring revenue through sales of the endowrist instruments and accessories and ongoing service 
the percentage of revenue derived from recurring instrument  accessory  and service revenue has grown from in to in and to in proposed merger on march   we entered into an agreement and plan of merger with computer motion  inc pursuant to the merger agreement  a wholly owned subsidiary of our company will merger with computer motion  with computer motion surviving the merger and continuing as a wholly owned subsidiary of our company 
in connection with the proposed merger  we have entered into a loan and security agreement with computer motion pursuant to which we have agreed to provide a short term secured bridge loan facility of up to million 
computer motion may use the facility to pay off existing indebtedness and to fund operations prior to completion of the merger 
this facility terminates and all outstanding amounts become due  subject to acceleration upon the occurrence of specified events 
interest on the facility will accrue at a rate of per annum and will be payable on the maturity date 
we expect that we and computer motion will hold our respective stockholders meetings at which matters related to the merger will be submitted for approval in june management anticipates that the combined companies will be able to achieve annual pre tax cost savings of approximately million commencing in late a significant portion of those savings will result from a substantial reduction in headcount 
intuitive surgical s ability to achieve these goals is subject to economic conditions and unanticipated changes in business conditions  and therefore there can be no assurance that these results will be achieved 
results of operations sales 
sales for the year ended december  were million  up from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the sale of systems during  compared to systems during total system revenue for the year ended december  was million  compared to million in the year ended december  the average system selling price  or asp  was  in  compared to  in  reflecting the impact of a us list price increase and a higher concentration of sales in the higher asp us market 
system unit sales by region in were in the us  in europe  and in the rest of the world  compared to system unit sales of in the us  in europe  and in the rest of the world 
also contributing to the revenue increase was continued growth in recurring instrument  accessory  and service revenue 
the recurring revenue increased by million  or  to million  compared to million in as cumulative placements of systems grew from at december  to at december  sales for the year ended december  of million were up from million for the year ended december  the sales increase was primarily due to an increase in the number of da vinci surgical systems sold to in from in gross profit 
gross profit for the year ended december  was million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  in and million  or of sales  in the year to year improvements in gross profit resulted from higher system asp increased manufacturing efficiencies and improved contribution from customer service operations 
in addition  and gross profit were both negatively impacted by a million non routine royalty charge that became due to ibm when we exceeded million in annual revenue in and million in excluding the impact of this charge  gross profit would have been million  or of sales  and gross profit would have been million  or of sales 
the royalty payment represented the final royalty obligation under our agreement with ibm 
research and development expenses 
the research and development costs were million  up from million in the increase was primarily due to headcount related increases of million  more clinical trial costs of  higher prototype material and project costs of  and higher facilities costs of  offset by lower deferred compensation amortization of  the research and development expenses of million were up from million in the increase was due to higher prototype material and project costs of million and headcount related increases of million 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the design  development  testing and enhancement of our products 
these enhancements represent significant improvements to our products 
research and development expenses also include expenditures for clinical trials and purchases of laboratory supplies 
research and development costs are expensed as incurred 
we expect to continue to make substantial investments in research and development and anticipate that research and development expenses will continue to increase in the future 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  up from million for the year over year increase was due in large part to support increased revenue and a larger installed base of da vinci surgical systems 
specifically  salaries and fringe benefits increased million  travel and entertainment increased million  and customer training and lab costs increased million 
selling  general and administrative expenses were also higher in due to increased legal expenses of million  unauthorized purchases of administrative supplies of  and facilities charges of  offset by lower depreciation of  and deferred compensation expense of  selling  general and administrative expenses for of million were million higher than the expenses of million 
this increase was primarily due to headcount increases resulting from growing sales and marketing activities as the da vinci surgical system received fda clearance in selling  general and administrative expenses include personnel costs for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  tradeshow expenses  legal expenses  regulatory fees and general corporate expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses are expected to increase in the future to support our expanding business 
deferred compensation 
we record deferred compensation as the difference between the exercise price of options granted and the fair value of our common stock at the time of grant for financial reporting purposes 
deferred compensation is amortized to research and development expenses and selling  general and administrative expenses 
for the years ended december   and  we recorded amortization of deferred stock compensation of  million  and million  respectively 
for  and  non cash deferred compensation expense included in research and development expenses was  million  and million  respectively 
for  and non cash deferred compensation expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses was   and  respectively 
deferred compensation recorded through december  was million with accumulated amortization of million 
the remaining  is scheduled to be amortized during the first half of interest income 
interest income was million  million  and million for   and  respectively 
the decreases resulted primarily from decreasing cash and short term investment balances over the period and lower interest rates earned on cash and short term investment balances in liquidity and capital resources prior to our initial public offering  we financed our operations primarily through sales of our preferred stock  yielding net proceeds of approximately million  and equipment financing arrangements yielding approximately million 
subsequently  our equipment financing arrangements yielded approximately million 
in june and july  we completed the initial public offering of  shares of our common stock and realized net proceeds of approximately million 
as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  compared to million at december  and million at december  working capital at december  was million  compared to million at december  and million at december  the decreases in cash and investments and working capital were primarily attributable to cash used to fund operating losses and to acquire fixed assets 
net cash used in operating activities was million for  compared to million for and for the decrease in cash used in operations during compared to primarily reflects lower working capital requirements in  primarily caused by increased collection of accounts receivable and higher accrued expense balances consisting mainly of accrued legal costs and accrued compensation  offset by lower accrued royalties 
the increase in cash used in operations during compared to primarily reflects higher working capital requirements in  primarily caused by the growth in our receivable balances due to increased sales over the prior period 
net cash provided by investing activities was million for  compared to net cash provided by investing activities of million in and net cash used by investing activities of in in and cash provided by investing activities resulted primarily from the net conversion of short term investments into cash to support operations 
the cash used in investing activities in related primarily to the purchase of short term investments with the net proceeds from our initial public offering 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for  compared to  for and million for in cash provided by financing activities resulted from proceeds from the issuance of common stock resulting mainly from the employee stock purchase plan and the exercise of stock options for million and net long term equipment financing proceeds of million 
in cash provided by financing resulted from proceeds from the issuance of common stock million  offset by net long term equipment financing repayments of million 
cash provided by investing activities in related primarily to our initial public offering in june  yielding net proceeds of million and proceeds from the issuance of preferred stock of million 
on march   we entered an agreement and plan of merger with computer motion  inc under the terms of our merger agreement with computer motion  computer motion will become a wholly owned subsidiary of our company 
computer motion recorded net losses of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  and had a cash balance of million as of december  in recent periods  computer motion has not generated cash from operations 
both we and computer motion expect to incur additional operating losses into  and both we and computer motion have substantial cash needs 
among other things  total fees and costs of both companies associated with the merger are currently projected to be approximately million 
intuitive surgical has agreed to fund up to million of computer motion s working capital needs through the effective time of the merger under the loan and security agreement 
assuming completion of the merger on or around june   we project that the total combined cash and cash equivalents of the two companies will be less than million 
in addition to the effects of the merger  our capital requirements depend on numerous factors  including market acceptance of our products  the resources we devote to developing and supporting our products and other factors 
we expect to devote substantial capital resources to continue our research and development efforts  to expand our customer support and product development activities and for other general corporate activities 
we believe that our current cash and short term investment balances  together with revenue to be derived from the sale of our products  will be sufficient to meet our liquidity requirements at least through during or after this period  if cash generated by operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may need to sell additional equity or debt securities or obtain additional credit arrangements 
additional financing may not be available on terms acceptable to us or at all 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments 
the following table summarizes all significant contractual payment obligations by payment due date payments by period millions contractual obligation total under year years years over years long term debt building lease total critical accounting policies we believe the following represent our critical accounting policies revenue recognition 
in certain cases  revenue from direct system sales is generated from multiple element arrangements which require judgement in the areas of customer acceptance  training  installation and collectibility 
revenue is recognized as specific elements indicated in sales contracts are executed 
if an element is essential to the functionality of an arrangement  the entire arrangement s revenue is deferred until that essential element is delivered 
the fair value of each undelivered element that is not essential to the functionality of the system is deferred until performance or delivery occurs 
the fair value of an undelivered element is based upon an estimate made by management 
amounts billed in excess of revenue recognized is recorded as deferred revenue on the balance sheet 
warranties 
we provide for the estimated costs of product warranties at the time revenue is recognized 
our estimate of costs to service our warranty obligations is based upon historical experience and expectation of future conditions 
if warranty claim activity and the costs associated with servicing those claims differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
the allowance for doubtful accounts is based upon management estimates 
factors underlying these estimates include analysis of days outstanding  customer payment history and management judgement 
the allowance is adjusted regularly to reflect current data and activity 
inventory reserves 
we write our inventory down for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
intangible assets 
we have intangible assets on our balance sheet related to the acquisition of patents 
the valuation and classification of these assets and the assignment of useful amortization lives involves judgments and the use of estimates 
the evaluation of these intangibles for impairment under established accounting guidelines is required on an ongoing basis 
changes in business conditions could potentially require future adjustments to asset valuations 
contingencies 
we are subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims related to our products  patents and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes to these matters as well as potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is made after careful analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
a complete description of all significant accounting policies is included in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  in item of this report 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued sfas no 
business combinations and sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june   and that the use of the pooling of interest method is no longer allowed 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to an annual impairment test in accordance with the new standards 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their respective useful lives 
we adopted sfas and sfas as of january  the adoption of sfas and sfas has not had a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
we will apply the provisions of sfas and sfas to the acquisition of computer motion when the merger is completed 
in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas we adopted sfas as of january   without a significant impact on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring  discontinued operation  plant closing  or other exit or disposal activity 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
we will apply sfas prospectively to activities initiated after december  in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 effective for the fiscal years beginning after december  sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of statement to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we continue to follow the intrinsic value method prescribed by apb in accounting for stock options  recognizing no compensation expense for options granted at or above market price 
we adopted the provisions of sfas effective for the fiscal year ended december  and have complied with the amended disclosure requirements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for most guarantees  including residual value guarantees issued in conjunction with operating lease agreements 
it also clarifies that at the time a company issues a guarantee  the company must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee and must disclose that information in its interim and annual financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  our adoption of fin did not have a material impact on our results of operations and financial position 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
a variable interest entity may be essentially passive or it may engage in research and development or other activities on behalf of another company 
the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we do not expect any significant impact on our financial position or results of operations upon adoption of this pronouncement 
in october  the emerging issues task force reached consensus on issue  or eitf  revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
the principles and application guidance of eitf should be used to determine a how the arrangement consideration should be measured  b whether the arrangement should be divided into separate units of accounting  and c how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the guidance in this issue is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  the company has not completed it s evaluation of the impact of the adoption of eitf on its results of operations or financial position 
factors affecting operating results our future operating results may be below securities analysts or investors expectations  which could cause our stock price to decline 
because of our limited operating history  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge in our market and affect our business 
the revenue and income potential of our market are unproven  and we may be unable to generate significant revenues 
in addition  our costs may be higher than we  securities analysts or investors expect 
if we fail to generate sufficient revenues or our costs are higher than we expect  our results of operations will suffer  which in turn could cause our stock price to decline 
further  future revenue from sales of our products is difficult to forecast because the market for new surgical technologies is still evolving 
our results of operations will depend upon numerous factors  including the progress and results of clinical trials  actions relating to regulatory matters  the completion of our pending merger with computer motion and the successful integration of the two companies  the extent to which our products gain market acceptance  our timing and ability to develop our manufacturing and sales and marketing capabilities  demand for our products  the progress of surgical training in the use of our products  our ability to develop  introduce and market new or enhanced versions of our products on a timely basis  product quality problems  our ability to protect our proprietary rights and defend against third party challenges  our ability to license additional intellectual property rights  and third party payor reimbursement policies 
our operating results in any particular period will not be a reliable indication of our future performance 
it is likely that in some future quarters  our operating results will be below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock  and the value of your investment  will likely decline 
we experience long and variable sales cycles  which could have a negative impact on our results of operations for any given quarter 
our da vinci surgical system has a lengthy sales and purchase order cycle because it is a major capital item and generally requires the approval of senior management at purchasing institutions 
these factors may contribute to substantial fluctuations in our quarterly operating results  particularly during the periods in which our sales volume is low 
because of these fluctuations  it is likely that in some future quarters our operating results will fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors 
if that happens  the market price of our stock would likely decrease 
these fluctuations also mean that you will not be able to rely upon our operating results in any particular period as an indication of future performance 
because a small number of customers have and are likely to continue to account for a substantial portion of our revenues  our revenues could decline due to the loss or delay of a single customer 
a relatively small number of customers account for a significant portion of our total revenues 
in  and  the majority of our revenues came from the sales of da vinci surgical systems  which are high revenue dollar items 
due to the high dollar revenue per system sold  small variations in system unit sales may cause revenue to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
for ab medica srl  our italian distributor  accounted for of total sales 
no customer accounted for more than of sales during or due to the high average selling price of the da vinci surgical system  our failure to add new customers that make significant purchases of our products could reduce our future revenues 
the loss or delay of individual orders could have a significant impact on revenues and operating results 
if our products do not achieve market acceptance  we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business 
our products represent a fundamentally new way of performing surgery 
achieving physician  patient and third party payor acceptance of intuitive surgery as a preferred method of performing surgery will be crucial to our success 
if our products fail to achieve market acceptance  hospitals will not purchase our products and we will not be able to generate the revenue necessary to support our business 
we believe that physicians and third party payors acceptance of the benefits of procedures performed using our products will be essential for acceptance of our products by patients 
physicians will not recommend the use of our products unless we can demonstrate that they produce results comparable or superior to existing surgical techniques 
even if we can prove the effectiveness of our products through clinical trials  surgeons may elect not to use our products for any number of other reasons 
for example  cardiologists may continue to recommend conventional open heart surgery simply because such surgery is already widely accepted 
in addition  surgeons may be slow to adopt our products because of the perceived liability risks arising from the use of new products and the uncertainty of reimbursement from third party payors 
we expect that there will be a learning process involved for surgical teams to become proficient in the use of our products 
broad use of our products will require training of surgical teams 
market acceptance could be delayed by the time required to complete this training 
we may not be able to rapidly train surgical teams in numbers sufficient to generate adequate demand for our products 
we cannot be certain that our training programs will be cost effective or sufficient to meet our customers needs 
we are involved in intellectual property litigation with computer motion and brookhill wilk  llc that may hurt our competitive position  may be costly to us and may prevent us from selling our products 
while the merger agreement has resulted in a stay of all proceedings involving computer motion  these proceedings may continue if the merger is not completed 
on may   computer motion filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the central district of california case no 
cv cbm alleging that by making  using  selling or offering for sale our da vinci surgical system  we are infringing united states patent numbers       and  in willful disregard of computer motion s patent rights 
on june   computer motion amended its lawsuit to allege that we also infringe us patent number  in late  computer motion alleged our infringement of a ninth patent  and added us patent number  to the litigation 
computer motion subsequently alleged that we infringed us patent no 
 which it added to the litigation in may these ten patents concern various methods and devices for conducting various aspects of robotic surgery 
of those ten patents  three are no longer part of the suit 
after computer motion lost all of its rights to its  and  patents as a result of our successful patent office interference proceedings computer motion voluntarily dismissed those patents from suit 
however  computer motion has sought to challenge the interference proceedings by separate district court appeal 
in addition  in november  the court granted our motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of the  patent 
in february  the court denied our motion for summary judgment of noninfringement of the  patent and granted computer motion s cross motion for partial summary judgment of literal infringement of one claim of that patent 
we subsequently requested that the court reconsider that decision because of perceived flaws in the court s approach to the issue of infringement on summary judgment 
regardless of what happens on reconsideration  we will continue to defend the patent on invalidity  based on the earlier robotic surgery work of sri and others 
we still have pending motions for summary judgment of noninfringement on two more of computer motion s seven remaining patents in suit  numbers  and  at the court s request  we will not file further motions for summary judgment until the remaining pending motions are decided 
in late january  after close of fact discovery  computer motion asserted between and new claims of its seven remaining patents in suit and new theories of infringement 
we have moved to strike those new assertions as inappropriate at this late stage 
trial had been calendared for april  in connection with our proposed merger with computer motion  our company and computer motion have agreed to request an immediate stay through august  of all proceedings in the pending litigations between the companies 
as part of the stays  the courts have ceased all further activity in the cases during the period of stay  and will not issue any opinions or orders on issues already submitted for decision 
in addition  the california court postponed the trial date and was asked to reset the trial to a date no earlier than november  the stay may be terminated before  or extended beyond  august  under specified circumstances 
in the event the merger is completed  our company and computer motion will request dismissal with prejudice of all pending litigations 
if the merger is not completed by august   the stays may be lifted and the california case may proceed to trial 
if the stays are lifted and we ultimately lose computer motion s suit against us  it will hurt our competitive position  may be costly to us and may prevent us from selling our products 
in addition  we may need to obtain from computer motion a license to this technology if we are to continue to market our products that have been found to infringe computer motion s patents 
this license could be expensive  or could require us to license to computer motion some of our technology  which would result in a partial loss of our competitive advantage in the marketplace  each of which could seriously harm our business 
if the stay is lifted and computer motion is successful in its suit against us and is unwilling to grant us a license  we will be required to stop selling our products that are found to infringe computer motion s patents unless we can redesign them so they do not infringe computer motion s patents  which we may be unable to do 
in addition  we could be required to pay computer motion damages  including treble damages  which could be substantial and harm our financial position 
on september   brookhill wilk  llc  or wilk  filed a lawsuit in the united states district court for the southern district of new york case no 
civ 
nrb alleging that by making  using  selling or offering for sale our da vinci surgical system  we are infringing us patent nos 
 and  in willful disregard of wilk s patent rights 
these patents concern methods and devices for remote surgery 
in march  wilk withdrew its assertion of the patent against our company 
on november   the district court granted summary judgment of noninfringement of the patent in our favor and dismissed wilk s complaint in its entirety without prejudice 
wilk appealed the summary judgment ruling to the us court of appeals for the federal circuit 
a decision on the merits of the appeal is expected sometime in if we lose on appeal and ultimately also lose wilk s suit against us  it will hurt our competitive position  may be costly to us and may prevent us from selling our products 
if we lose the patent suit  we may need to obtain from wilk a license to this technology if we are to continue to market our products that have been found to infringe wilk s patents 
this license could be expensive  which could seriously harm our business 
if wilk is successful in its suit against us and is unwilling to grant us a license  we may be required to stop selling our products that are found to infringe wilk s patents unless we can redesign them so they do not infringe wilk s patents  which we may be unable to do 
in addition  we could be required to pay wilk damages  including treble damages  which could be substantial and harm our financial position 
on february   wilk filed suit against computer motion alleging that its zeus surgical system infringed upon wilk s us patent nos 
 and  wilk s complaint sought damages  attorneys fees and increased damages alleging willful patent infringement 
on march   computer motion served its answer and counterclaim alleging non infringement of each patent in suit  patent invalidity and unenforceability 
on november   the united states district court for the southern district of new york in the co pending brookhill wilk v 
intuitive surgical  inc  civil action no 
cv nrb  issued an order interpreting the claims of wilk s us patent no 
 in a way that computer motion believed excluded current applications of its zeus surgical system 
in light of this decision  on november   wilk and computer motion agreed to dismiss the case without prejudice to refiling upon resolution of the appeal in wilk s litigation against intuitive surgical 
the foregoing proceedings would be expensive to litigate  may be protracted and our confidential information may be compromised 
whether or not we are successful in this lawsuit  these proceedings could consume substantial amounts of our financial and managerial resources 
at any time the other parties may file additional claims against our company  or we may file claims against them  which could increase the risk  expense and duration of the litigations 
for more information on these proceedings  see item business legal proceedings 
if we are unable to protect the intellectual property contained in our products from use by third parties  our ability to compete in the market will be harmed 
our commercial success will depend in part on obtaining patent and other intellectual property protection for the technologies contained in our products  and on successfully defending our patents and other intellectual property against third party challenges 
we will incur substantial costs in obtaining patents and  if necessary  defending our proprietary rights 
the patent positions of medical device companies  including ours  can be highly uncertain and involve complex and evolving legal and factual questions 
we do not know whether we will obtain the patent protection we seek  or that the protection we do obtain will be found valid and enforceable if challenged 
we also do not know whether we will be able to develop additional patentable proprietary technologies 
if we fail to obtain adequate protection of our intellectual property  or if any protection we obtain is reduced or eliminated  others could use our intellectual property without compensating us  resulting in harm to our business 
we may also determine that it is in our best interests to voluntarily challenge a third party s products or patents in litigation or administrative proceedings  including patent interferences or reexaminations 
in addition  the laws of certain foreign countries do not protect intellectual property rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
others may assert that our products infringe their intellectual property rights  which may cause us to engage in costly disputes and  if we are not successful in defending ourselves  could also cause us to pay substantial damages and prohibit us from selling our products 
we are aware of both united states and foreign patents issued to third parties that relate to computer assisted surgery  remote surgery  and minimally invasive surgery 
some of these patents on their face appear broad enough to cover one or more aspects of our present technology  and may cover aspects of our future technology 
we do not know whether any of these patents  if challenged  would be held valid  enforceable and infringed 
from time to time  we receive  and likely will continue to receive  letters from third parties inviting us to license their patents 
we may be sued by  or become involved in an administrative proceeding with  one or more of these third parties 
we cannot assure you that a court or administrative body would agree with any arguments or defenses we have concerning invalidity  unenforceability or noninfringement of any third party patent 
in addition to the issued patents of which we are aware  other parties may have filed  and in the future are likely to file  patent applications covering surgical products that are similar or identical to ours 
we cannot assure you that any patents issuing from applications filed by a third party will not cover our products or will not have priority over our patent applications 
the medical device industry has been characterized by extensive litigation and administrative proceedings regarding patents and other intellectual property rights  and companies have employed such actions to gain a competitive advantage 
if third parties assert infringement or other intellectual property claims against us as computer motion and brookhill wilk  llc have done  our technical and management personnel will experience a significant diversion of time and effort and we will incur large expenses defending our company 
if third parties in any patent action are successful  our patent portfolio may be damaged  we may have to pay substantial damages  including treble damages  and we may be required to stop selling our products or obtain a license which  if available at all  may require us to pay substantial royalties 
we cannot be certain that we will have the financial resources or the substantive arguments to defend our patents from infringement or claims of invalidity or unenforceability  or to defend against allegations of infringement of third party patents 
in addition  any public announcements related to litigation or administrative proceedings initiated by us  or initiated or threatened against us  could cause our stock price to decline 
the rights and measures we rely on to protect the intellectual property underlying our products may not be adequate to prevent third parties from using our technology which could harm our ability to compete in the market 
in addition to patents  we typically rely on a combination of trade secret  copyright and trademark laws  nondisclosure agreements and other contractual provisions and technical security measures to protect our intellectual property rights 
nevertheless  these measures may not be adequate to safeguard the technology underlying our products 
if they do not protect our rights adequately  third parties could use our technology  and our ability to compete in the market would be reduced 
in addition  employees  consultants and others who participate in developing our products may breach their agreements with us regarding our intellectual property  and we may not have adequate remedies for the breach 
we also may not be able to effectively protect our intellectual property rights in some foreign countries 
for a variety of reasons  we may decide not to file for patent  copyright or trademark protection outside the united states 
we also realize that our trade secrets may become known through other means not currently foreseen by us 
notwithstanding our efforts to protect our intellectual property  our competitors may independently develop similar or alternative technologies or products that are equal or superior to our technology and products without infringing any of our intellectual property rights  or may design around our proprietary technologies 
for further information on our intellectual property and the difficulties in protecting it  see item business intellectual property 
our products rely on licenses from third parties  and if we lose access to these technologies  our revenues could decline 
we rely on technology that we license from others  including technology that is integral to our products 
we have entered into license agreements with sri international  ibm corporation  mit  olympus optical co  ltd  and heartport  inc  now part of johnson johnson 
any of these agreements may be terminated for breach 
if any of these agreements is terminated  we may be unable to reacquire the necessary license on satisfactory terms  or at all 
the loss or failure to maintain these licenses could prevent or delay further development or commercialization of our products 
see item business intellectual property 
public announcements of litigation events may cause our stock price to decline 
during the course of our administrative proceedings and or lawsuits  there may be public announcements of the results of hearings  motions  and other interim proceedings or developments in the litigation 
if securities analysts or investors perceive these results to be negative  it could have a substantial negative effect on the trading price of our stock 
our products are subject to a lengthy and uncertain domestic regulatory process 
if we do not obtain and maintain the necessary domestic regulatory approvals  we will not be able to market and sell our products in the united states 
our products and operations are subject to extensive regulation in the united states by the us food and drug administration  or fda 
the fda regulates the research  testing  manufacturing  safety  labeling  storage  recordkeeping  promotion  distribution  and production of medical devices in the united states to ensure that medical products distributed domestically are safe and effective for their intended uses 
in order for us to market certain products for use in the united states  we generally must first obtain clearance from the fda pursuant to section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetic act  or ffdca 
clearance under section k requires demonstration that a new device is substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device 
if we modify our products after they receive fda clearance  the fda may require us to submit a separate k or premarket approval application  or pma  for the modified product before we are permitted to market the products in the us in addition  if we develop products in the future that are not considered to be substantially equivalent to a legally marketed device  we will be required to obtain fda approval by submitting a pma 
the fda may not act favorably or quickly in its review of our k or pma submissions  or we may encounter significant difficulties and costs in our efforts to obtain fda clearance or approval  all of which could delay or preclude sale of new products in the united states 
furthermore  the fda may request additional data  require us to conduct further testing  or compile more data  including clinical data and clinical studies  in support of a k submission 
the fda may also  instead of accepting a k submission  require us to submit a pma  which is typically a much more complex application than a k 
to support a pma  the fda would likely require that we conduct one or more clinical studies to demonstrate that the device is safe and effective  rather than substantially equivalent to another legally marketed device 
we may not be able to meet the requirements to obtain k clearance or pma approval  or the fda may not grant any necessary clearances or approvals 
in addition  the fda may place significant limitations upon the intended use of our products as a condition to a k clearance or pma approval 
product applications can also be denied or withdrawn due to failure to comply with regulatory requirements or the occurrence of unforeseen problems following clearance or approval 
any delays or failure to obtain fda clearance or approvals of new products we develop  any limitations imposed by the fda on new product use  or the costs of obtaining fda clearance or approvals could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in order to conduct a clinical investigation involving human subjects for the purpose of demonstrating the safety and effectiveness of a device  a company must  among other things  apply for and obtain institutional review board  or irb approval of the proposed investigation 
in addition  if the clinical study involves a significant risk as defined by the fda to human health  the sponsor of the investigation must also submit and obtain fda approval of an investigational device exemption  or ide application 
we may not be able to obtain fda and or irb approval to undertake clinical trials in the us for any new devices we intend to market in the united states in the future 
if we obtain such approvals  we may not be able to comply with the ide and other regulations governing clinical investigations or the data from any such trials may not support clearance or approval of the investigational device 
failure to obtain such approvals or to comply with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
for additional information concerning regulatory approvals of our products  see item business government regulation 
our products are subject to various international regulatory processes and approval requirements 
if we do not obtain and maintain the necessary international regulatory approvals  we will not be able to market and sell our products in foreign countries 
to be able to market and sell our products in other countries  we must obtain regulatory approvals and comply with the regulations of those countries 
these regulations  including the requirements for approvals  and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country 
obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals are expensive  and we cannot be certain that we will receive regulatory approvals in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approval in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products  our ability to generate revenue will be harmed 
the european union requires that manufacturers of medical products obtain the right to affix the ce mark to their products before selling them in member countries of the european union 
the ce mark is an international symbol of adherence to quality assurance standards and compliance with applicable european medical device directives 
in order to obtain the right to affix the ce mark to products  a manufacturer must obtain certification that its processes meet certain european quality standards 
in january  we received permission to affix the ce mark to our da vinci surgical system and endowrist instruments 
if we modify existing products or develop new products in the future  including new instruments  we may need to apply for permission to affix the ce mark to such products 
in addition  we will be subject to annual regulatory audits in order to maintain the ce mark permissions we have already obtained 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to obtain permission to affix the ce mark for new or modified products or that we will continue to meet the quality and safety standards required to maintain the permissions we have already received 
if we are unable to maintain permission to affix the ce mark to our products  we will no longer be able to sell our products in member countries of the european union 
if institutions or surgeons are unable to obtain reimbursement from third party payors for procedures using our products  or if reimbursement is insufficient to cover the costs of purchasing our products  we may be unable to generate sufficient sales to support our business 
domestic institutions will typically bill the services performed with our products to various third party payors  such as medicare  medicaid and other government programs and private insurance plans 
if hospitals do not obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors for procedures performed with our products  or if government and private payors policies do not permit reimbursement for surgical procedures performed using our products  we may not be able to generate the revenues necessary to support our business 
our success in international markets also depends upon the eligibility of our products for reimbursement through government sponsored health care payment systems and third party payors 
reimbursement practices vary significantly by country 
many international markets have government managed healthcare systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures 
other foreign markets have both private insurance systems and government managed systems that control reimbursement for new products and procedures 
market acceptance of our products may depend on the availability and level of reimbursement in any country within a particular time 
in addition  health care cost containment efforts similar to those we face in the united states are prevalent in many of the other countries in which we intend to sell our products and these efforts are expected to continue 
for further information on third party reimbursement policies  see item business third party reimbursement 
because our markets are highly competitive  customers may choose to purchase our competitors products or may not accept intuitive surgery  which would result in reduced revenue and loss of market share 
intuitive surgery is a new technology that must compete with established minimally invasive surgery and open surgery 
these procedures are widely accepted in the medical community and in many cases have a long history of use 
we also face competition from several companies that are developing new approaches and products for the minimally invasive surgery market 
in addition  we presently face increasing competition from companies who are developing robotic and computer assisted surgical systems 
our revenues may be reduced or eliminated if our competitors develop and market products that are more effective or less expensive than our products 
if we are unable to compete successfully  our revenues will suffer 
we may not be able to maintain or improve our competitive position against current or potential competitors  especially those with greater resources 
in many cases  the medical conditions that can be treated using our products can also be treated by drugs or other medical devices and procedures 
many of these alternative treatments are also widely accepted in the medical community and have a long history of use 
in addition  technological advances could make such treatments more effective or less expensive than using our products  which could render our products obsolete or unmarketable 
we cannot be certain that physicians will use our products to replace or supplement established treatments or that our products will be competitive with current or future technologies 
if defects are discovered in our products  we may incur additional unforeseen costs  hospitals may not purchase our products and our reputation may suffer 
our products incorporate mechanical parts and computer software  either of which can contain errors or failures  especially when first introduced 
in addition  new products or enhancements may contain undetected errors or performance problems that  despite testing  are discovered only after commercial shipment 
because our products are designed to be used to perform complex surgical procedures  we expect that our customers will have an increased sensitivity to such defects 
we cannot assure you that our products will not experience errors or performance problems in the future 
if we experience flaws or performance problems  any of the following could occur delays in product shipments  loss of revenue  delay in market acceptance  diversion of our resources  damage to our reputation  increased service or warranty costs  or product liability claims 
we have limited experience in manufacturing our products and may encounter manufacturing problems or delays that could result in lost revenue 
we have manufactured a limited number of our products for sale to customers 
we may be unable to establish or maintain reliable  high volume manufacturing capacity 
even if this capacity can be established and maintained  the cost of doing so may increase the cost of our products and reduce our ability to compete 
we may encounter difficulties in scaling up production of our products  including problems involving production yields  quality control and assurance  component supply shortages  shortages of qualified personnel  and compliance with state  federal and foreign regulations 
manufacturing our products is a complex process 
if demand for our products exceeds our manufacturing capacity  we could develop a substantial backlog of customer orders 
if we are unable to establish and maintain larger scale manufacturing capabilities  our ability to generate revenues will be limited and our reputation in the marketplace would be damaged 
if our manufacturing facilities do not continue to meet federal  state or european manufacturing standards  we may be required to temporarily cease all or part of our manufacturing operations  which would result in product delivery delays and lost revenue 
our manufacturing facilities are subject to periodic inspection by regulatory authorities and our operations will continue to be regulated by the fda for compliance with good manufacturing practice requirements contained in the fda s quality system regulations  or qsr 
we are also required to comply with international organization for standardization  or iso quality system standards in order to produce products for sale in europe 
if we fail to continue to comply with good manufacturing practice requirements or iso standards  we may be required to cease all or part of our operations until we comply with these regulations 
we are currently in compliance with iso standards 
the fda inspected our mountain view and sunnyvale facilities in march and december  respectively 
the good manufacturing practice issues raised by the fda during the inspections either were satisfactorily resolved with the fda  or we believe can be resolved by us to the fda s satisfaction  although we cannot assure you that we will be able to do so 
we continue to be subject to fda inspections at any time 
maintaining such compliance is difficult and costly 
we cannot be certain that our facilities will be found to comply with good manufacturing practice requirements or iso standards in future inspections and audits by regulatory authorities 
the state of california also requires that we maintain a license to manufacture medical devices 
our facilities and manufacturing processes were inspected in february in march  we passed the inspection and received a device manufacturing license from the california department of health services 
in march  our facilities and manufacturing processes in our sunnyvale facility were re inspected by the food and drug branch  or fdb  and we were issued an updated device manufacturing license for our sunnyvale facility 
we are subject to periodic inspections by the california department of health services and if we are unable to maintain this license following any future inspections  we will be unable to manufacture or ship any products 
our reliance on sole and single source suppliers could harm our ability to meet demand for our products in a timely manner or within budget 
some of the components necessary for the assembly of our products are currently provided to us by sole source suppliers or single source suppliers 
we purchase components through purchase orders rather than long term supply agreements and generally do not maintain large volumes of inventory 
the disruption or termination of the supply of components could cause a significant increase in the costs of these components  which could affect our profitability 
a disruption or termination in the supply of components could also result in our inability to meet demand for our products  which could harm our ability to generate revenues  lead to customer dissatisfaction and damage our reputation 
furthermore  if we are required to change the manufacturer of a key component of our products  we may be required to verify that the new manufacturer maintains facilities and procedures that comply with quality standards and with all applicable regulations and guidelines 
the delays associated with the verification of a new manufacturer could delay our ability to manufacture our products in a timely manner or within budget 
the use of our products could result in product liability claims that could be expensive  divert management s attention and harm our business 
our business exposes us to significant risks of product liability claims 
the medical device industry has historically been litigious  and we face financial exposure to product liability claims if the use of our products were to cause injury or death 
there is also the possibility that defects in the design or manufacture of our products might necessitate a product recall 
although we maintain product liability insurance  the coverage limits of these policies may not be adequate to cover future claims 
particularly as sales of our products increase  we may be unable to maintain product liability insurance in the future at satisfactory rates or in adequate amounts 
a product liability claim  regardless of its merit or eventual outcome  could result in significant legal defense costs 
a product liability claim or any product recalls could also harm our reputation or result in a decline in revenues 
and as a group 
we cannot be certain that our personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations 
if we lose our key personnel or are unable to attract and retain additional personnel  our ability to compete will be harmed 
we are highly dependent on the principal members of our management and scientific staff 
our product development plans depend in part on our ability to attract and retain engineers with experience in mechanics  software and optics 
attracting and retaining qualified personnel will be critical to our success  and competition for qualified personnel is intense 
we may not be able to attract and retain personnel on acceptable terms given the competition for such personnel among technology and healthcare companies  and universities 
the loss of any of these persons or our inability to attract and retain qualified personnel could harm our business and our ability to compete 
international sales of our products account for a significant portion of our revenues  which exposes us to risks inherent in international operations 
our growth may be limited if we are unable to successfully manage our international activities 
our business currently depends in large part on our activities in europe  and a component of our growth strategy is to expand our presence into additional foreign markets 
sales to markets outside of the united states accounted for approximately  and of our sales for   and  respectively 
we are subject to a number of challenges that specifically relate to our international business activities 
these challenges include failure of local laws to provide the same degree of protection against infringement of our intellectual property  protectionist laws and business practices that favor local competitors  which could slow our growth in international markets  the risks associated with foreign currency exchange rate fluctuation  the expense of establishing facilities and operations in new foreign markets  and building an organization capable of supporting geographically dispersed operations 
currently  a majority of our international sales are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  an increase in the value of the us dollar relative to foreign currencies could make our products less competitive in international markets 
if we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges  our international operations may not be successful  which would limit the growth of our business 
risk factors associated with our pending merger with computer motion the issuance of shares of intuitive surgical common stock to computer motion stockholders in the merger will substantially reduce the percentage interests of intuitive surgical stockholders 
based on an estimated exchange ratio of approximately  we estimate that we will issue approximately million shares of our common stock in the merger and upon completion of the merger  our current stockholders will own approximately of the then outstanding shares of our common stock and former computer motion stockholders will own approximately of the then outstanding shares of our common stock 
in addition  based on the estimated exchange ratio of approximately  we estimate that we will reserve approximately million shares of intuitive surgical common stock for future issuance in connection with intuitive surgical s assumption of computer motion s outstanding options and warrants including out of the money options and warrants  subject to proportional reduction in the event that the proposed reverse stock split is approved by our stockholders and implemented by our board of directors 
the outstanding warrants of computer motion have a range of exercise prices 
holders of these warrants have the right to an adjustment in the exercise price of their warrants  and in some cases in the number of shares issuable upon exercise  if the warrant issuer sells shares in the future at prices below the exercise prices of the warrants 
these anti dilution protections may continue to apply after the merger and thus could result in additional dilution to stockholders of the combined company as we make future offerings of capital stock 
the issuance of shares of intuitive surgical common stock to former computer motion stockholders in or after the merger will cause a significant reduction in the relative percentage interests of current intuitive surgical stockholders in earnings  voting  liquidation value and book and market value 
the issuance of additional shares of intuitive surgical common stock in future transactions could also reduce the percentage interests of former computer motion stockholders and intuitive surgical stockholders in the combined company 
this dilution could reduce the market price of our common stock 
intuitive surgical and computer motion each have incurred substantial losses since inception  expect to incur further losses  and may not be able to generate or raise sufficient cash to fund their operations  separate or combined 
we incurred a net loss of million for  and computer motion incurred a net loss of million for the same period 
the extent of our future losses and the timing of profitability are highly uncertain  and we may never achieve profitable operations 
if the time required to generate significant revenues and achieve profitability is longer than anticipated  we may not be able to continue our operations 
in recent periods  computer motion has not generated cash from operations 
both companies expect to incur additional operating losses into  and both companies have substantial cash needs 
among other things  total fees and costs of both companies associated with the merger are currently projected to be approximately million 
we have agreed to fund up to million of computer motion s working capital needs through the effective time of the merger under the loan and security agreement 
assuming completion of the merger on or around june   we project that the total combined cash and cash equivalents of the two companies will be less than million 
we expect that the capital resources of the combined company  together with revenue derived from product sales  will be sufficient to meet the combined company s working capital needs at least through after that  we may need to raise additional funds 
we may not be able to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  or at all 
if we are unable to generate sufficient capital to fund our operations and cannot raise it on acceptable terms  we may not be able to further develop  enhance or expand the market for our products and services  and the combined company could fail 
the combined company may not realize all of the anticipated benefits of the merger 
the success of the merger will depend  in part  on the ability of the combined company to realize the anticipated synergies  cost savings and growth opportunities from integrating the business of computer motion with the business of intuitive surgical 
our success in realizing these benefits and the timing of this realization depend upon the successful  rapid integration of the operations of computer motion with those of intuitive surgical 
this integration will be a complex  costly and time consuming process  and may not succeed as planned 
the difficulties of combining the operations of the companies include  among other things coordinating and consolidating ongoing and future research and development efforts  consolidating sales and marketing operations  retaining existing customers and attracting new customers  retaining strategic partners and attracting new strategic partners  retaining key employees  consolidating corporate and administrative infrastructures  integrating and managing the technologies and products of the two companies  identifying and eliminating redundant and underperforming operations and assets  using capital assets efficiently to develop the business of the combined company  minimizing the diversion of management s attention from ongoing business concerns  and coordinating geographically separate organizations 
in addition  computer motion s products differ in substantial ways from our products  and the companies rely on different distributors and sales channels to sell their products 
both computer motion and intuitive surgical are parties to existing distribution agreements that cannot be terminated prior to the end of their terms 
we do not know whether the combined company will succeed in addressing these risks or any other problems encountered in connection with the merger  or whether the integration of computer motion with intuitive surgical will result in the realization of the full benefits anticipated by us from the merger 
failure to complete the merger could negatively impact intuitive surgical and its stockholders 
if the merger is not completed for any reason  intuitive surgical and computer motion and their stockholders will be subject to a number of material risks  including the provision in the merger agreement that  under specified circumstances  either intuitive surgical or computer motion could be required to pay the other a termination fee and expenses of up to an aggregate of million  the litigations between the two companies may resume  computer motion would be required to repay to intuitive surgical all amounts loaned under the bridge loan facility within days following termination of the merger agreement  computer motion likely would not have sufficient cash to repay amounts loaned under the bridge loan  and intuitive surgical would be at risk that such bridge loan amounts would not be repaid unless computer motion were able to obtain alternative financing  the market price of intuitive surgical common stock and computer motion common stock may decline to the extent that the current market price of such shares reflects a market assumption that the merger will be completed  costs related to the merger  such as legal and accounting fees  must be paid even if the merger is not completed  benefits that intuitive surgical and computer motion expect to realize from the merger would not be realized  and the diversion of management attention from the day to day businesses of the companies and the unavoidable disruption to their employees and customers during the period before completion of the merger may make it difficult for intuitive surgical and computer motion to regain their financial and market positions if the merger does not occur 
sales by intuitive surgical stockholders or former computer motion stockholders could cause intuitive surgical s common stock price to decline 
the market price of intuitive surgical common stock could decline as a result of sales of a large number of shares in the market 
these sales may also make it more difficult for the combined company to sell equity securities in the future at a time and at a price that we deem appropriate to raise funds through future offerings of common stock 
as of december   several entities beneficially owned more than of the outstanding shares of intuitive surgical s common stock  including bear stearns asset management  allan g 
lozier  investor growth capital  ltd  merrill lynch co  and patmark company  inc assuming that the merger is completed  the former stockholders of computer motion will own approximately of the combined company  subject to the assumptions and adjustments discussed elsewhere in this joint proxy statement prospectus 
in addition  holders of warrants to purchase up to million shares of computer motion common stock will receive intuitive surgical warrants in exchange for their computer motion warrants in connection with the merger 
such warrant holders will have the right to include their shares in resale registration statements that we will be obligated to file on their behalf 
customer  supplier  and employee uncertainty related to the merger could harm the combined company 
intuitive surgical and computer motion customers and suppliers may  in response to the announcement or completion of the merger  delay purchasing or supply decisions or otherwise alter existing relationships with intuitive surgical or computer motion 
these decisions or other adverse changes in the business relationships of intuitive surgical and computer motion with their respective customers and suppliers could adversely affect the business of the combined company 
similarly  current and prospective computer motion employees may experience uncertainty about their future as employees of the combined company until strategies with regard to computer motion are announced or executed 
this may adversely affect intuitive surgical s or computer motion s ability to attract and retain  and may affect the performance during the transition period of  key management  sales  marketing and technical personnel 
the conviction of arthur andersen llp on obstruction of justice charges may adversely affect arthur andersen s ability to satisfy claims arising from the provision of auditing services to computer motion and may impede the combined company s access to capital markets after the merger 
arthur andersen llp audited computer motion s financial statements for the years ended december  and december  on march   an indictment was unsealed charging arthur andersen with federal obstruction of justice arising from the government s investigation of enron corp 
on june   arthur andersen was convicted of these charges 
the impact of this conviction on arthur andersen s financial condition may adversely affect the ability of arthur andersen to satisfy any claims arising from its provision of auditing services to computer motion 
should intuitive surgical seek to access the public capital markets after completion of the merger  sec rules will require intuitive surgical to include or incorporate by reference in any prospectus three years of audited financial statements 
the sec s current rules would require intuitive surgical to present audited financial statements for one or more fiscal years audited by arthur andersen and use reasonable efforts to obtain its consent until the audited financial statements for the fiscal year ending december  become available 
if prior to that time the sec ceases accepting financial statements audited by arthur andersen  it is possible that the available audited financial statements for the years ended december  and december  audited by arthur andersen might not satisfy the sec s requirements 
in that case  intuitive surgical would be unable to access the public capital markets unless an independent accounting firm were able to audit the financial statements originally audited by arthur andersen 
any delay or inability to access the public capital markets caused by these circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the combined company s business  profitability and growth prospects 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are not subject to any meaningful market risks related to currency  commodity prices or similar matters 
we are sensitive to short term interest rate fluctuations to the extent that such fluctuations impact the interest income we receive on the investment of the remaining proceeds from our june initial public offering 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while at the same time maximizing the income we receive from our investments without significantly increasing risk 
some of the securities that we invest in may have market risk 
this means that a change in prevailing interest rates may cause the principal amount of the investment to fluctuate 
for example  if we hold a security that was issued with a fixed interest rate at the then prevailing rate and the prevailing interest rate later rises  the principal amount of our investment will probably decline 
to minimize this risk in the future  we intend to maintain our portfolio of cash equivalents and short term investments in a variety of securities 
we classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities as fixed rate if the rate of return on such instruments remains fixed over their term 
these fixed rate investments include commercial paper and government and non government debt securities 
we classify our cash equivalents and marketable securities as variable rate if the rate of return on such investments varies based on the change in a predetermined index or set of indices during their term 
these variable rate investments primarily included money market accounts 
the average duration of all of our investments as of december  was approximately years 
at december   approximately of our investment portfolio was composed of investments with original maturities of one year or less 
the following table presents the amounts of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments that may be subject to interest rate risk and the weighted average interest rates by year of maturity in thousands as of december  weighted average fair interest rate value cash equivalents variable rate  marketable securities fixed rate mature in  fixed rate mature in  fixed rate mature in  fixed rate mature in  fluctuations in interest rates would also impact interest expense on future fixed rate notes payable for equipment financing contracts  should we elect to finance future equipment purchases 
the following table summarizes installment notes outstanding as of december  and the associated interest rates by year of maturity in thousands weighted final outstanding average installment december  rate less current portion  long term portion
