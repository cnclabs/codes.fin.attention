item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of the consolidated financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto elsewhere herein 
the company is a fully integrated  self administered and self managed reit which owns  operates  develops and finances manufactured housing communities concentrated in the midwestern and southeastern united states 
as of december   the company owned and operated a portfolio of developed properties located in seventeen states  including manufactured housing communities  five recreational vehicle communities  and seven properties containing both manufactured housing and recreational vehicle sites 
during  the company acquired four manufactured housing communities  comprising  developed sites and sites suitable for development for million  and the company sold one manufactured housing community for million 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
in preparing these financial statements  management has made its best estimates and judgment of certain amounts included in the financial statements 
nevertheless  actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following significant accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements impairment of long lived assets 
rental property is recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation 
management evaluates the recoverability of its investment in rental property whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as recent operating results  expected net operating cash flow and plans for future operations  indicate that full asset recoverability is questionable 
if such assets were deemed to be impaired as a result of this measurement  the impairment that would be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset as determined on a discounted net cash flow basis 
notes receivable 
the company evaluates the recoverability of its notes receivable including the notes receivable from origen whenever events occur or there are changes in circumstances such that management believes it is probable that it will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the contractual terms of the loan agreement 
the loan is then measured based on the present value of the expected future cash flow discounted at the loan s effective interest rate or the fair value of the collateral if the loan is collateral dependent 
depreciation 
depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the assets 
the company uses a thirty year useful life for land improvements and buildings and a seven to fifteen year useful life for furniture  fixtures and equipment 
revenue recognition 
rental income attributable to leases is recorded on a straight line basis when earned from tenants 
leases entered into by tenants generally range from month to month to one year and are renewable by mutual agreement of the company and the resident 
capitalized costs 
the company capitalizes certain costs including interest and other costs incurred in connection with the development  redevelopment  capital enhancement and leasing of its properties 
management is required to use professional judgment in determining whether such costs meet the criteria for immediate expense or capitalization 
the amounts are dependent on the volume and timing of such activities and the costs associated with such activities 
maintenance  repairs and minor improvements to properties are expensed when incurred 
renovations and improvements to properties are capitalized and depreciated over their estimated useful lives and construction costs related to the development of new community or expansion sites are capitalized until the property is substantially complete 
certain expenditures to dealers and residents related to obtaining lessees in our communities are capitalized and amortized over a seven year period  shorter than the average resident s occupancy in the home and the average term that the home is in our community 
costs associated with implementing the company s new computer systems are capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful lives of the related software and hardware 
derivative instruments and hedging activities 
during  the company entered into three interest rate swap agreements to offset interest rate risk 
the company does not enter into derivative transactions for speculative purposes 
the company adjusts its balance sheet on an ongoing quarterly basis to reflect current fair market value of its derivatives 
changes in the fair value of derivatives are recorded each period in earnings or comprehensive income  as appropriate 
the ineffective portion of the hedge is immediately recognized in earnings to the extent that the change in value of a derivative does not perfectly offset the change in value of the instrument being hedged 
the unrealized gains and losses held in accumulated other comprehensive income will be reclassified to earnings over time and occurs when the hedged items are also recognized in earnings 
the company uses standard market conventions to determine the fair values of derivative instruments  including the quoted market prices or quotes from brokers or dealers for the same or similar instruments 
all methods of assessing fair value result in a general approximation of value and such value may never actually be realized 
deferred tax assets 
shs currently has significant deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
shs has recognized deferred tax assets of million  net of a valuation reserve of million 
realization of these deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon shs s achievement of projected future taxable income 
judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions  shs s ability to continue to successfully execute its business plan and other factors 
income taxes 
the company has elected to be taxed as a reit as defined under section c of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
in order for the company to qualify as a reit  at least ninety five percent of the company s gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources 
as a reit  the company generally will not be subject to us federal income taxes at the corporate level if it distributes at least ninety percent of its reit ordinary taxable income to its stockholders  which it fully intends to do 
if the company fails to qualify as a reit in any taxable year  the company will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on its taxable income at regular corporate rates 
the company remains subject to certain state and local taxes on its income and property as well as federal income and excise taxes on its undistributed income

liquidity and capital resources the company s principal liquidity demands have historically been  and are expected to continue to be  distributions to the company s stockholders and the operating partnership s unitholders  property acquisitions  development and expansion of properties  capital improvements of properties and debt repayment 
the company expects to meet its short term liquidity requirements through its working capital provided by operating activities and its line of credit  as described below 
the company considers its ability to generate cash from operations anticipated to be approximately million to be adequate to meet all operating requirements  including recurring capital improvements  routinely amortizing debt and other normally recurring expenditures of a capital nature  pay dividends to its stockholders to maintain qualification as a reit in accordance with the internal revenue code and make distributions to the operating partnership s unitholders

in  the company closed on a million collateralized five year variable rate at december  debt facility with an option to extend an additional five years at a variable rate debt facility  which is convertible to a five to ten year fixed rate loan but not to exceed a total term of fifteen years 
in july  the company refinanced its existing line of credit to an million unsecured line of credit facility  which matures in july  with a one year optional extension 
at december   the average interest rate of outstanding borrowings under the line of credit was  million was outstanding and million was available to be drawn under the facility 
subsequent to year end  the company increased the line to million 
the line of credit facility contains various leverage  debt service coverage  net worth maintenance and other customary covenants all of which the company was in compliance with at december  in  certain directors  employees and consultants of the company purchased newly issued shares of common stock of the company and common op units in the operating partnership for approximately million in accordance with the sun communities stock purchase plan the purchase plan 
the participants in the purchase plan financed these purchases through personal loans the loans from bank one  na the bank due in january the company guaranteed the repayment of the loans 
the participants have agreed to fully indemnify the company against any and all liabilities arising under such guaranty the guaranty the principal balance of which was approximately million at december  
among other usual commercial provisions  the guaranty requires that the company comply with certain financial covenants 
these covenants were initially designed to be identical in all material respects with the financial covenants imposed on the company under its line of credit facility 
since  as the covenants in the company s then applicable line of credit facility changed  the guaranty has also been similarly amended to remain consistent 
in july  the company entered into a replacement line of credit facility  however  conforming amendments to the guaranty were not made  resulting in differing and inconsistent financial covenants in the line of credit facility as compared to the guaranty 
as a consequence  as of september   the company was not in compliance with certain of the financial covenants contained in the guaranty the differing financial covenants 
because it was not the intention of the parties to impose disparate requirements on the guaranty and the company s line of credit  the bank waived any breach of the guaranty arising solely as a result of the company s non compliance with the differing financial covenants so long as the company remains in compliance with all of the terms and conditions of its line of credit facility 
as of december   the company was in compliance with the terms and conditions of its line of credit facility and  as a result  the company was in compliance with the terms and conditions of the guaranty 
section of the sarbanes oxley act of the sarbanes oxley act states that it is unlawful for any issuer 


directly or indirectly  including through any subsidiary  to extend or maintain credit  to arrange for the extension of credit  or to renew an extension of credit  in the form of a personal loan to or for any director or executive officer or equivalent thereof of that issuer 
section of the sarbanes oxley act provides an exception for certain extensions of credit which are maintained by the issuer on the date of enactment of the sarbanes oxley act 
july  

 provided that there is no material modification to any term of any such extension of credit or any renewal of any such extension of credit on or after that date of enactment 
jaffe  raitt  heuer weiss  pc has delivered a reasoned opinion to the company to the effect that  based on various assumptions and qualifications set forth in the opinion  a court could reasonably find that section of the sarbanes oxley act does not apply to the waiver letter issued by the bank and that  even if a court determines that section applies to the bank s waiver letter  a court could reasonably conclude that the guaranty fits within the exception under section for extensions of credit maintained by the issuer prior to july  arthur a 
weiss  a stockholder of jaffe  raitt  heuer weiss  pc  the company s regular outside counsel  is a director of the company and received a personal loan to purchase common op units under the purchase plan 
there is no case law directly on point  and we cannot assure you that a court would not decide differently from the views expressed in counsel s opinion and such opinion represents only the best judgment of counsel and is not binding in the courts 
it is unclear what the consequences to the company would be if a court determined the bank s waiver letter constituted a material modification of the terms of the guaranty in violation of section of the sarbanes oxley act and the securities exchange act of  as amended 
the company s primary long term liquidity needs are principal payments on outstanding indebtedness 
at december   the company s outstanding contractual obligations were as follows payments due by period in thousands contractual cash obligations total due year years years after years bridge loan   line of credit   collateralized term loan    collateralized term loan fnma   senior notes      mortgage notes  other      capitalized lease obligations    redeemable preferred op units      as noted above  the company is the guarantor of million in personal bank loans  maturing in  made to the company s directors  employees and consultants for the purpose of purchasing shares of company common stock or operating partnership op units pursuant to the company s stock purchase plan 
the company is obligated under the guaranty only in the event that one or more of the borrowers cannot repay their loan when due 
this contingent liability is not reflected on the company s balance sheet 
the provisions of the callable redeemable million notes are such that the maturity date will likely be if the year treasury rate is greater than on may  the maturity is reflected in the above table based on that assumption 
the company anticipates meeting its long term liquidity requirements  such as scheduled debt maturities  large property acquisitions and operating partnership unit redemptions  through the issuance of debt or equity securities  including equity units in the operating partnership  or from selective asset sales 
as discussed above  the company is also obligated to loan origen up to million under the origen credit facility  of which million remained to be drawn as of december  the company has maintained investment grade ratings with moody s investor service and standard poor s  which facilitates access to the senior unsecured debt market 
since  the company has raised  in the aggregate  nearly billion from the sale of shares of its common stock  the sale of op units in the operating partnership  and the issuance of secured and unsecured debt securities 
in addition  at december   of the properties were unencumbered by debt  therefore  providing substantial financial flexibility 
the ability of the company to finance its long term liquidity requirements in such manner will be affected by numerous economic factors affecting the manufactured housing community industry at the time  including the availability and cost of mortgage debt  the financial condition of the company  the operating history of the properties  the state of the debt and equity markets  and the general national  regional and local economic conditions 
see factors that may affect future results 
if the company is unable to obtain additional equity or debt financing on acceptable terms  the company s business  results of operations and financial condition will be harmed 
the company s million bridge loan and million principal amount of senior unsecured notes are due april and may   respectively 
the company expects to repay this indebtedness by issuing additional senior unsecured debt securities 
the ability of the company to issue such additional debt securities will be affected primarily by the state of the senior unsecured debt market and general  national and international economic and political conditions  such as the uncertainty associated with the current war in iraq 
if the company is unable to access the senior unsecured debt market  or is unable to otherwise refinance these notes  on terms acceptable to the company prior to may  and the company is unable to successfully negotiate extensions with the holders of these debt obligations  the company would seek secured financing on some of its unencumbered properties 
included in minority interests are million of preferred op units which would require collateralization were the company to no longer be classified as investment grade by the rating agencies 
at december   the company s debt to total market capitalization approximated percent assuming conversion of all common op units to shares of common stock 
the debt has a weighted average maturity of approximately years and a weighted average interest rate of percent 
capital expenditures for the years ended december  and included recurring capital expenditures of million and million  respectively 
net cash used in investing activities was million for the year ended december  compared to million in the prior year 
the differences are due to increased investment in rental properties of million  decreased proceeds from property disposition of million  and increased investment in notes receivables and investment in and advances to affiliates of million 
additionally  the company acquired million in rental properties through the issuance of preferred op units 
net cash provided by financing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to a use of net cash in the prior year of million 
the differences are due to changes in net proceeds from notes payable  inclusive of line of credit repayments  of million  changes in net proceeds from common stock issuance of million  and increased distributions of million 
ratio of earnings to fixed charges the company s ratio of earnings to fixed charges for the years ended december    and was  and respectively

other funds from operations ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit as net income computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus rental property depreciation and amortization  and after adjustments for unconsolidated partnerships and joint ventures 
industry analysts consider ffo to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the operating performance of an equity reit primarily because the computation of ffo excludes historical cost depreciation as an expense and thereby facilitates the comparison of reits which have different cost bases in their assets 
historical cost accounting for real estate assets implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time  whereas real estate values have instead historically risen or fallen based upon market conditions 
ffo does not represent cash flow from operations as defined by generally accepted accounting principles and is a supplemental measure of performance that does not replace net income as a measure of performance or net cash provided by operating activities as a measure of liquidity 
in addition  ffo is not intended as a measure of a reit s ability to meet debt principal repayments and other cash requirements  nor as a measure of working capital 
the following table reconciles net income to ffo and calculates ffo data for both basic and diluted purposes for the years ended december   and in thousands sun communities  inc

the valuation adjustment reflects the theoretical noncash profit and loss were those swaps terminated at the balance sheet date 
as the company has no expectation of terminating the swaps prior to maturity  the net of these noncash valuation adjustments will be zero at the various maturities 
as any imperfections related to hedging correlation in these swaps is reflected currently in cash as interest  the valuation adjustments are excluded from funds from operations 
the valuation adjustment is included in interest expense 
the company acquired the equity interest of another investor in sunchamp in december consideration consisted of a long term note payable at net book value 
the note is subordinated to the return of gross book value of equity and cumulative preferred returns of on the company s investment and the acquired investment

accordingly  the losses formerly allocated or allocable to the company are reallocated to the note 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the company s principal market risk exposure is interest rate risk 
the company mitigates this risk by maintaining prudent amounts of leverage  minimizing capital costs and interest expense while continuously evaluating all available debt and equity resources and following established risk management policies and procedures  which include the periodic use of derivatives 
the company s primary strategy in entering into derivative contracts is to minimize the variability that changes in interest rates could have on its future cash flows 
the company generally employs derivative instruments that effectively convert a portion of its variable rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for speculative purposes
