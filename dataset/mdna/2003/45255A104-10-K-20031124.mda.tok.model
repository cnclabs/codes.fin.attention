item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes appearing in item of this form k 
our discussion contains forward looking statements based upon current expectations that involve risks and uncertainties  such as our plans  objectives  expectations and intentions 
actual results and the timing of events could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of a number of factors  including those set forth below under risk factors and elsewhere in this form k 
overview we provide information technology systems for cancer care 
our systems provide electronic medical record  imaging  decision support  scheduling and billing applications in an integrated platform to manage the complexities of cancer care  from detection and diagnosis through treatment and follow up 
we were founded in  and our growth has been primarily organic  supplemented by several product and small company acquisitions 
net sales and revenue recognition we sell our products directly throughout the world and primarily in north america  europe and the pacific rim countries 
in addition  we use non exclusive distributors to augment our direct sales efforts 
sales through distributors represented of our total net sales in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal  all of which were sold through siemens medical systems  inc revenues from the sale of our products and services outside the united states accounted for million  or  of our net sales in fiscal  million  or  of our net sales in fiscal and million  or  of our net sales in fiscal the decline in distributor sales as a percentage of net sales is attributable to a higher growth rate in our direct sales 
we have signed agreements with other distributors  which have not yet generated sales 
we license point of care and registry software products 
our point of care products are comprised of modules that process administrative  clinical  imaging and therapy delivery information 
our registry products aggregate data on patient outcomes for regulatory and corporate reporting purposes 
currently  a majority of our point of care software is licensed on a perpetual basis  and a majority of our registry sales is licensed on a term basis 
our focus with regard to software licensing and maintenance and support service is to provide flexibility in the structure and pricing of our product offerings to meet the unique functional and financial needs of our customers 
for those customers who license on a perpetual basis  we promote annual maintenance and support service agreements as an incremental investment designed to preserve the value of the customer s initial investment 
for those customers who license on a term basis  annual maintenance and support contributes greatly to the value of the annual license  and the two cannot be segregated from each other 
for those customers using our application service provider option  independent of the licensing method  these annual fees allow the customer to outsource  in a cost effective manner  support and connectivity functions that are normally handled by internal resources 
the decision to implement  replace  expand or substantially modify an information system is a significant commitment for healthcare organizations 
in addition  our systems typically require significant capital expenditures by the customer 
consequently  we experience long sales and implementation cycles 
the sales cycle for our systems ranges from six to twenty four months or more from initial contact to contract execution 
our implementation cycle generally ranges from three to nine months from contract execution to completion of implementation 
we record orders for products licensed on a perpetual basis upon the receipt of a signed purchase and license agreement  purchase order  and a substantial deposit 
we record orders for products licensed on a term basis upon receipt of a signed purchase and license agreement  purchase order and a deposit typically equal to the 
table of contents first year s fees 
all contract deposits are held as a liability until the customer has accepted the product as outlined in the terms and conditions set forth in the purchase and license agreement 
maintenance and support is recorded as deferred revenue upon the invoice date and held as a current liability on the balance sheet 
under the terms of the original purchase and license agreement  maintenance and support automatically renews on an annual basis unless the customer provides a written cancellation 
we recognize revenue from these sales ratably over the underlying maintenance period 
for direct software sales licensed on a perpetual basis  we include one year of maintenance and support as part of the purchase price 
we recognize revenue upon acceptance of the installed product at the customer site 
since the first year of maintenance and support is included in the purchase price  we defer of the purchase price and recognize that portion of the revenue ratably over a twelve month period 
standard annual fees for maintenance and support after the first year equal of the then current list price unless the customer negotiates other terms or service levels 
we recognize these fees ratably over the applicable twelve month period 
for direct software sales licensed on a term basis  the initial term lasts from three to five years with annual renewals after the initial term 
the customer pays a deposit typically equal to the initial annual fee upon signing the license agreement  and we invoice the customer for subsequent annual fees days before the anniversary date of the signed agreement 
we recognize revenue for the annual fees under these term license agreements ratably over the applicable twelve month period 
the purchase price includes annual maintenance and support 
we recognize revenue from third party products and related configuration and installation services sold with our licensed software upon acceptance by the customer 
we recognize revenue from third party products sold separately from our licensed software upon delivery 
third party products represented of our total net sales in fiscal the increase in third party sales as a percentage of net sales is attributable to a higher growth rate in our third party product sales 
we recognize distributor related revenues upon the receipt of a completed purchase order and the related customer information needed to generate software registration keys  which allow us to distribute the software to the end user and satisfy our regulatory information tracking requirements 
we invoice maintenance and support annually and recognize revenue ratably over the applicable twelve month period 
costs and expenses a large part of our company cost structure is driven by the number of employees and all related benefit and facility costs 
as a result  a significant amount of strategic and fiscal planning is focused on this area  so we can develop internal resources at a controlled and sustainable rate 
since revenue recognition happens subsequent to all implementation and training activities  we incur the costs of labor  travel and some third party product expenses in advance 
cost of sales consists primarily of labor costs relating to the implementation  installation  training and application support of our point of care and registry software  travel expenses incurred in the installation and training of our point of care software  direct expenses related to the purchase  shipment  installation and configuration of third party hardware and software sold with our point of care software  continuing engineering expenses related to the maintenance of existing released software  and overhead attributed to our client services personnel 
system installations require several phases of implementation in the process of accepting product delivery and have led to our development of a highly specialized client service organization 
all new orders require multiple site visits from our personnel to properly install  configure and train customer personnel 
several point 
table of contents of care products are used with various third party hardware and software products that are also sold and configured during the implementation process 
after the initial implementation process  our application support staff provides phone support and any applicable system updates 
a substantial percentage of engineering costs are allocated to client services due to continuing engineering efforts related to the support and enhancement of our products 
historically  cost of sales has increased at approximately the same rate as net sales 
however  as newly developed products and acquired product lines are released to the customers  additional investments in client service staff could cause gross margins to fluctuate 
research and development expenses include costs associated with the design  development and testing of our products 
these costs consist primarily of salaries and related development personnel expenses  software license and support fees associated with development tools  travel expenses incurred to test products in the customer environment  and overhead attributed to our development and test engineering personnel 
we currently expense all research and development costs as incurred 
our research and development efforts are periodically subject to significant non recurring costs that can cause fluctuations in our quarterly research and development expense trends 
we expect that research and development expenses will increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in product development 
sales and marketing expenses primarily consist of salaries  commissions and related travel expenses for personnel engaged in sales and the contracts administration process  salaries and related product marketing  marketing communications  media services and business development personnel expenses  expenses related to marketing programs  public relations  trade shows  advertising and related communications  and overhead attributed to our sales and marketing personnel 
we have consistently expanded our sales force  made significant investments in marketing communications and increased trade show activities to enhance market awareness of our products 
we expect that sales and marketing expenses will increase in absolute dollars for the foreseeable future as we continue to expand our sales and marketing capabilities 
general and administrative expenses primarily consist of salaries and related administrative  finance  human resources  regulatory  information services and executive personnel expenses  other significant expenses relate to facilities  recruiting  external accounting and legal and regulatory fees  general corporate expenses  and overhead attributed to our general and administrative personnel 
a significant portion of facility  infrastructure and maintenance costs are allocated as overhead to other functions based on distribution of headcount 
our general and administrative expenses increased after our initial public offering  and we expect these expenses will remain higher in absolute dollars in the foreseeable future 
depreciation and amortization our property and equipment is recorded at our cost minus accumulated depreciation and amortization 
we depreciate the costs of our tangible capital assets on a straight line basis over the estimated economic life of the 
table of contents asset  which is generally three to seven years 
acquisition related intangible assets have historically been amortized based upon the estimated economic life  which is generally two to five years 
leasehold improvements and equipment purchased through a capital lease are amortized over the life of the related asset or the lease term  if shorter 
if we sell or retire an asset  the cost and accumulated depreciation is removed from the balance sheet and the appropriate gain or loss is recorded 
we expense repair and maintenance costs as incurred 
acquisitions in april  we purchased all of the outstanding stock of mc scientific systems  inc  or mc  for million in cash and acquisition costs of  mc was a privately held medical software company that developed imaging and simulation software technology 
the acquisition included a medical imaging dicom product and two products in development that will be used to plan radiation therapy treatments 
we have just completed the development of the in process products 
at the time of acquisition  mc generated very little revenue and the impact on operating costs included the addition of two employees 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded an expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of  net tangible liabilities of  and goodwill and intangible assets of  we recorded the acquisition using the purchase method of accounting 
the amortization of intangible assets other than goodwill is being taken over a range of periods from two to five years 
upon our adoption of statement of financial accounting standards  or sfas  no 
goodwill and other intangible assets on october   the remaining unamortized balance of goodwill and acquired workforce  which was reclassified to goodwill  of  has ceased to be amortized 
instead  we perform annual impairment assessments by applying a fair value based test 
the annual goodwill impairment test was completed during the first quarter of fiscal  and it was determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at that time 
in february  we purchased the intellectual property of carecore  inc  or carecore  for extinguishment of notes receivable in the amount of  held by us and  in acquisition costs 
carecore was a privately held internet based healthcare company that was developing a web portal for cancer patients and their families 
the carecore asset acquisition brought us additional clinical charting web based intellectual property that we have since incorporated into one of our product lines and a list of registered web site names relating to cancer 
the company did not generate any revenues and the impact on operating costs included the addition of two employees both of whom filled open positions within our company 
we recorded the transaction using the purchase method of accounting 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded an expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of  and intangible assets of  we recorded amortization of acquired workforce over ten months 
this acquisition became fully amortized during fiscal in april  we purchased all the outstanding stock of intellidata  inc  or intellidata  for million in cash and acquisition costs of  intellidata was a privately held laboratory information system company 
the intellidata acquisition adds a laboratory information management capability to our product line  which is complementary to our oncology electronic medical record 
subsequent to the acquisition through september   we have recognized maintenance and support revenues of  and added employees 
we will invest in expanding our support and sales functions by adding additional employees  however  we expect the increase in sales will offset the associated impact of increased operating expenses 
we have recorded the transaction using the purchase method of accounting in accordance with sfas no 
business combinations 
as a result of this transaction  we recorded an expense associated with the purchase of in process research and development of  net tangible liabilities of  and goodwill and intangible assets of million 
during fiscal  we wrote off acquired accounts receivable balances totaling approximately  in accordance with sfas no 
 this amount was reallocated from accounts receivable to goodwill in the acquisition purchase price allocation 
in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill was not amortized 
instead  we perform annual impairment assessments by applying a fair value based test 
the annual goodwill impairment test was completed during the first quarter of fiscal  and it was determined that there was no impairment of goodwill at that time 

table of contents accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock from september  until our initial public offering  the holders of a majority of our then outstanding redeemable convertible preferred stock could have required us to redeem the preferred shares by paying in cash an amount equal to the greater of per share or the fair market value plus all declared or accumulated but unpaid dividends within thirty days 
these shares automatically converted to common stock upon the closing of our initial public offering in november we accreted charges that reflected the increase in market value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock as an adjustment to retained earnings and  as a result  decreased net income available to common stockholders or increased the amount of net loss attributable to common stockholders 
after our initial public offering  no further accretion has been or will be required 
the redemption value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock was million at the time of our initial public offering 
this amount was reclassified on our balance sheet from redeemable convertible preferred stock to common stock and additional paid in capital upon the closing of the initial public offering 
see note of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for a more detailed explanation 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operating data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated

table of contents comparison of years ended september  and net sales 
net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal net software related sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales of imaging systems accounted for million of the million increase  new system sales in oncology accounted for million  sales of additional new products in oncology accounted for million  and the remaining increase was attributable to new sales in registry  urology and laboratory software 
an increase in the average system price  due primarily to an increase in the number of products included in each order  contributed of the overall increase in net software related sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  with the remaining contribution attributable to an increase in volume of installations 
maintenance and services increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal maintenance and support contracts contributed million of the million increase and additional training and installation contributed  our continued high customer retention on maintenance and support contracts  the general price increase  and expansion of our service offerings all contributed to the growth of maintenance and services as a percentage of net sales 
cost of sales 
total cost of sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our gross margin decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal cost of sales relating to net software sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal our gross margin associated with net software sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in expenses related to million in employee related costs   in supplies and materials and  in implementation costs

this was an investment year for our client services organization  and we added significant headcount to our application support organization domestically 
we also established an installation and support infrastructure in europe as part of our international expansion plans 
finally  we have begun implementing customers under our us oncology contract who use our application service provider option out of our data center 
research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total net sales  research and development expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal additional engineering headcount and the associated personnel expenses were the primary factors for the increase in absolute dollars 
the decrease as a percentage of total net sales in fiscal was due to increased net sales relative to research and development expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total net sales  sales and marketing expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to  in employee related expenses   in travel expenses   in commissions and  in advertising partially offset by a  reduction in outside services   reduction in supplies and a  reduction in sponsorships

general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in business insurance of  employee related expenses of  professional fees of  rent of  outside services of  maintenance costs of  depreciation expense of  and travel costs of  the increase in expenses was partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense of  charitable contributions of  and telephone expense of  the decrease as a percentage of total net sales in fiscal was due to increased net sales relative to general and administrative expenses 

table of contents in process research and development 
during fiscal  we did not have any transactions that required an in process research and development write off 
during fiscal  we recorded a write off of in process research and development in the amount of  due to an analysis allocating the purchase price paid for certain intellectual property in that period 
intellidata was in the process of adding new functionality to its line of laboratory information system products and we believed there was sufficient risk in completing the technology to qualify the in process research and development  write off 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization expenses decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal our adoption of sfas no 
 as of october  was the primary cause of the decline in amortization expense 
in accordance with sfas no 
 we have ceased amortizing goodwill and instead we perform an assessment for impairment at least annually by applying a fair value based test 
we have also reclassified the unamortized balance of acquired workforce to goodwill 
accordingly  no goodwill or acquired workforce amortization was recognized fiscal remaining amortization relating to developed core technology acquired from mc was completed in march we still amortize certain intangible assets acquired from intellidata in april as it relates to developed core technology  customer base and a covenant not to compete 
no goodwill amortization is included in amortization expense related to either transaction during fiscal operating income 
operating income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal operating income increased significantly due to the higher rate of increase in net sales relative to the rate of increase in operating expenses 
in fiscal  we continued to expand our sales force and increase our client service staff  which resulted in increased sales in the period 
in addition  we did not complete any acquisitions and amortization expense decreased due to the adoption of sfas no 
during fiscal interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the increase is related to higher cash balances due to our initial public offering in november  a second public offering in may  and increase positive cash flow generated from operations in fiscal income taxes 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal and fiscal comparison of years ended september  and net sales 
net sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal net software related sales increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal sales of additional products to our existing customers in radiation oncology  such as imrt interfaces  accounted for million of the million increase  new system sales in radiation oncology accounted for million  sales of new imaging systems accounted for million  and registry annual licenses accounted for  a general price increase contributed of the overall increase in net software related sales in fiscal as compared to fiscal  with the remaining contribution being attributable to an increase in unit sales volume 
maintenance and services also increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal maintenance and support contracts contributed million of the million increase  additional training and installation contributed  and the billing service contributed  our continued high customer retention on maintenance and support contracts  the general price increase  and expansion of our service offerings all contributed to the growth of maintenance and services as a percentage of net sales

research and development 
research and development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total net sales  research and development expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal additional engineering headcount and the associated personnel expenses were the primary factors for the increase in absolute dollars 
the decrease as a percentage of total net sales in fiscal was due to increased net sales relative to research and development expenses 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total net sales  sales and marketing expenses increased slightly from in fiscal to in fiscal a significant expansion and restructuring of our domestic sales force as well as an increase in product marketing headcount in late increased employee related expenses by million and  in commission expenses 
in addition  marketing communications expenses increased by  as we continued to focus on promotion  marketing materials and public relations 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal as a percentage of total net sales  general and administrative expenses decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to increases in our allowance for doubtful accounts of  general office supplies and materials of  executive travel of  business insurance premiums of  stock based compensation of  and facility maintenance costs of  the increase in the allowance for doubtful accounts was related to  of receivables acquired from intellidata and an increase in specific reserves of  for a limited number of customers who have indicated that economic conditions are impacting their ability to remit payment 
the decrease as a percentage of total net sales in fiscal was due to increased product sales relative to general and administrative expenditures 
in process research and development 
we recorded a write off of in process research and development in the amount of  in fiscal and  in fiscal due to an analysis allocating the purchase price paid for certain intellectual property in those periods 
for the same period in fiscal  carecore s only product was still under development and also qualified for a  write off 
amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets 
amortization expenses increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal our acquisition of intellidata in april increased amortization expense as it relates to developed core technology  customer base and a covenant not to compete 
no goodwill is included in the amortization related to this transaction 
our acquisition of intellectual property from carecore in february increased amortization expenses as it relates to acquired workforce 
operating income 
operating income increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal operating income increased significantly due to the higher rate of increase in net sales relative to the rate of increase in operating expenses 
in fiscal  we expanded our sales and marketing capabilities and research and development efforts  which resulted in increased sales in the period 
although we wrote off  in fiscal  our write off of  of purchased in process research and development from carecore also contributed to lower operating income in fiscal as compared to fiscal interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net decreased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal the decline is related to lower interest income from investments in short and long term marketable securities resulting from lower interest rates in fiscal income taxes 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal compared to in fiscal the higher tax rate was primarily due to higher operating income and the discontinuation of our foreign sales corporation tax advantage in fiscal

we discuss below some of the larger changes in various line items in the table above 
net sales 
during the first quarter ending december of each fiscal year  our software license sales tend to decrease due to seasonality matters relating to our installation process 
our installation and training process for new customers is dependent on our ability to be on site to recognize revenue 
our first fiscal quarter includes two major holiday seasons and a major industry trade show that affect nearly four weeks of the quarter  resulting in less time for us to perform the implementation necessary to recognize software revenues 
cost of sales 
cost of sales tends to be higher as a percentage of total net sales in the first quarter ending december of each fiscal year due to the seasonal impact of total net sales in the same quarter 
a significant portion of cost of sales is fixed since our delivery and installation process is dependent on headcount 
operating expenses 
operating expenses tend to be higher as a percentage of total net sales in the first quarter ending december of each fiscal year due to the seasonal impact affecting recognition of revenue for our software sales in the same quarter 
in addition  the most significant trade show that we attend occurs within 
table of contents the quarter ending december  which increases our sales and marketing expenses 
in the quarter ended june   we wrote off  of purchased in process research and development  which also resulted in a net income margin for the quarter lower than normal 
net income 
our first quarter generally results in the lowest net income during the fiscal year due to factors influencing net sales  including the higher expenses relating to our largest trade show of the year 
the second and third quarters typically result in the highest net income figures for the year as we do not incur any significant seasonal expenses during those quarters 
our fourth quarter typically results in net income slightly less than the third quarter due to higher travel expenses relating to the sales and implementation process and the determination of company wide year end bonuses 
accretion of redeemable convertible preferred stock 
prior to our initial public offering  each reporting period  the carrying value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock was increased by periodic accretions  using the effective interest method  so that the carrying amount would equal the redemption value at the redemption date 
these increases were effected through charges against retained earnings 
several factors have influenced our determination of the value of the redeemable convertible preferred stock 
these factors included our plans for an initial public offering  the performance of our business  changes in our business model and significant product introductions  current market conditions and the performance of the stock price of our comparable companies 
the quarter ended december  was the last period in which the accretion charges were required to be recorded due to our initial public offering in november we believe that quarterly revenues and operating results are likely to vary significantly in the future and that quarter to quarter comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as indications of future performance 
inflation the results of operations and financial condition are presented based upon historical cost 
while it is difficult to accurately measure the impact of inflation  we believe that the effects of inflation on its operations have been immaterial 
backlog as of september   we had a backlog of million compared to a backlog of million as of september  our backlog is comprised of system sales and maintenance and support services 
we expect to fulfill approximately million of our backlog at september  during fiscal with the remaining portion to be completed in subsequent periods 
we cannot assure you that contracts included in backlog will generate the specified revenues or that these revenues will be fully recognized within the specified time periods 
seasonality historically  we have experienced a seasonal pattern in our operating results related primarily to revenues  with our first quarter typically having the lowest revenues followed by significant revenue growth in the subsequent quarters of our fiscal year 
in particular  we have experienced strong revenue growth in the fourth quarter that we believe to be related to the year end of many of our customers budgetary cycles 
we believe the seasonality of our revenue in the first quarter is due to the impact of the holiday season and a major industry trade show on the on site portion of the implementation process 
net income levels are typically the lowest in our first fiscal quarter with significant improvement occurring in sequential quarters 
in addition  the implementation of a significant contract previously included in backlog could generate a large increase in revenue and net income for any given quarter or fiscal year  which may prove unusual when compared to changes in revenue and net income in other periods 
furthermore  we typically experience long sales 
table of contents cycles for new customers  which may extend over several quarters before a sale is consummated and a customer implementation occurs 
as a result  we believe that quarterly results of operations will continue to fluctuate and that quarterly results may not be indicative of future periods 
the timing of revenues is influenced by a number of factors  including the timing of individual orders  customer implementations and seasonal customer buying patterns 
liquidity and capital resources we have financed our operations since inception primarily through cash from operating activities and a million private placement of equity in in november  we completed our initial public offering and raised net proceeds of million and in may  we completed a secondary public offering and raised net proceeds of million 
cash  cash equivalents and available for sale securities were million at september   million at september  and million at september  net cash provided by operating activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal for fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income after adjustment for non cash charges relating to depreciation and amortization 
increases in customer deposits  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue also contributed to cash provided by operating activities 
for fiscal and fiscal  cash provided by operating activities was primarily attributable to net income after adjustment for non cash charges relating to depreciation  amortization and the provision for doubtful accounts 
increases in customer deposits  accrued liabilities  income taxes payable and deferred revenue  offset by an increase in accounts receivable also contributed to cash provided by operating activities in fiscal and fiscal we incurred non cash charges related to write offs of in process research and development of  in fiscal and  in fiscal during the past three years  we have aimed to improve the productivity of our accounts receivable 
in determining average days sales outstanding and accounts receivable turnover  we use our gross annual invoicing and gross accounts receivable balances in each calculation as we believe this provides a more conservative and relevant measurement basis due to the significance of our deferred revenue 
our accounts receivable turnover decreased slightly to for fiscal compared to in fiscal our days sales outstanding at september  increased to from at september  we believe that the overall increase in sales for fiscal as compared to fiscal has impacted the calculation of accounts receivable turnover and days sales outstanding ratios 
we continue our efforts to improve collections by maintaining appropriate staffing levels  formalizing escalation procedures and improving internal communications 
revenue is only recognized when all of the criteria for revenue recognition have been met  which is upon acceptance and invoicing of the final balance of the fee unless the invoice has payment terms extending longer than days 
any invoice that has payment terms longer than days is considered to have extended payment terms and is not recognized as a receivable or revenue until it is due and payable 
net cash used in investing activities was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal in fiscal  cash used in investing activities primarily related to the purchase of million in property and equipment relating to an expansion office located in henderson  nevada and  for the purchase of the intellectual property of carecore 
in fiscal  cash used in investing activities was attributed to payments of million and  relating to the acquisitions of intellidata and mc  respectively  and payments of million to acquire property and equipment  offset by net proceeds from sales and maturities of available for sale securities of million 
in fiscal  cash used in investing activities was primarily due to million in property and equipment expenditures for office expansions and to support the application service provider agreement with us oncology and net purchases of available for sale securities of million due to increased cash investment activity after our initial and secondary public offerings 
net cash provided by used in financing activities was  in fiscal   in fiscal and million in fiscal cash used in financing activities in fiscal was for principal payments on our capital lease of  partially offset by proceeds from the issuance of common stock of  cash provided by financing activities in fiscal resulted from proceeds received from the issuance of common stock of  partially offset by lease payments of  and by the repurchase of common stock of 
table of contents  in november  we completed our initial public offering and raised net proceeds of approximately million and in may  we completed a secondary public offering and raised net proceeds of approximately million 
option exercise activity increased after the initial public offering  and we raised an additional million through employee stock option exercises  including stock issued under the employee stock purchase plan  during fiscal cash provided by operating activities for fiscal was partially offset by capital lease payments of in fiscal  we entered a capital lease for the purchase of furniture for our corporate headquarters 
this capital lease is scheduled to be fully repaid in february the interest rate for this financing is per year and equates to an aggregate monthly payment of  as of september   the principal balance outstanding on the capital lease totaled  we have granted a security interest to the lenders in all furniture covered by this lease 
the following table describes our commitments to settle contractual obligations in cash not recorded on the balance sheet as of september  in thousands 
the telecommunications contracts with at t include wireless  frame relay  voice data and internet transport services 
fiscal year property leases operating leases telecommunications contracts total future obligations we expect to increase capital expenditures consistent with our anticipated growth in infrastructure and personnel 
we also may increase our capital expenditures as we expand our product lines or invest in new markets 
we believe that the net proceeds from the common stock to be sold in the offering  together with available funds and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our operating requirements  assuming no change in the operations of our business  for at least the next months 
foreign currency risks 
to date  we have had minimal sales outside of the united states and  therefore  have only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risks 
purchases made from foreign vendors are primarily made in us dollars and  therefore  we have only minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
we do not hedge against foreign currency risks and believe that foreign currency exchange risk is immaterial 
recent accounting pronouncements in november  the emerging issues task force  or eitf  reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services and or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   including interim periods 
as we account for multiple element arrangements under the higher level authoritative literature of sop no 
 as amended  the adoption of eitf issue no 
has had no material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
in january  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
in october  the fasb released for public comment a proposed exposure draft clarifying certain aspects of fin and providing certain entities with exemptions from the requirements of fin if approved  the exposure draft would 
table of contents apply to financial statements for the first period ending after december  we expect that the adoption of fin will have no material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity  or sfas no 
sfas no 
requires that certain financial instruments  which under previous guidance were accounted for as equity  must now be accounted for as liabilities 
the financial instruments affected include mandatorily redeemable stock  certain financial instruments that require or may require the issuer to buy back some of its shares in exchange for cash or other assets and certain obligations that can be settled with shares of stock 
sfas no 
is effective for all financial instruments entered into or modified after may  and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period after june  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material impact on our financial position or on our results of operations 
critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
requires all companies to include a discussion of critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
revenue recognition statement of position no 
generally requires revenue earned on software arrangements involving multiple elements to be allocated to each element based on vendor specific objective evidence 
for hardware transactions where no software is involved  we apply the provisions of staff accounting bulletin revenue recognition 
as discussed below  significant management judgments and estimates must be made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any accounting period 
material differences may result in the amounts and timing of our revenue for any period if our management made different judgments or utilized different estimates 
the fee for multiple element arrangements is allocated to each element of the arrangement  such as maintenance and support  based on the relative fair values of the elements 
we determine the fair value of each element in multi element arrangements based on vendor specific objective evidence for each element  which is based on the price charged when the same element is sold separately 
if evidence of fair value of all undelivered elements exists but evidence does not exist for one or more delivered elements  then revenue is recognized using the residual method 
under the residual method  the fair value of the undelivered elements is deferred and the remaining portion of the arrangement fee is recognized as revenue 
we recognize revenue from the sale of software licenses when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product has been accepted  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
acceptance generally occurs when the product has been installed  training has occurred and the product is in clinical use at the customer site 
for distributor related transactions  acceptance occurs with delivery of software registration keys to the distributor s order fulfillment department 
at the time of the transaction  we assess whether the fee associated with our revenue transactions is fixed or determinable and whether or not collection is probable 
we assess whether the fee is fixed or determinable based on the payment terms associated with the transaction 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
fair values for the ongoing maintenance  which includes updates and support  are based upon a percentage of the current list price of the software 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  are based upon separate sales by us of these services to other customers 
we recognize revenue for maintenance services ratably over the contract term 
our training and consulting services are billed based on hourly rates  and we generally recognize revenue as these services are performed 
the use of different estimates or assumptions could produce different results 

table of contents allowance for doubtful accounts our estimate for the allowance for doubtful accounts related to trade receivables is based on two methods 
the amounts calculated from each of these methods are combined to determine the total amount reserved 
first  we evaluate specific accounts where we have information that the customer may have an inability to meet its financial obligations 
in these cases  we use our judgment  based on the best available facts and circumstances  and record a specific reserve for that customer against amounts due to reduce the receivable to the amount that is expected to be collected 
these specific reserves are reevaluated and adjusted as additional information is received that impacts the amount reserved 
second  a general reserve is established for all customers based on a percentage applied to the outstanding receivable amount 
this percentage is based on historical collection and write off experience 
if circumstances change such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a major customer s ability to meet its financial obligation to the company  our estimates of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
deferred taxes we recognize deferred tax assets and liabilities based on the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based on historical taxable income  projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
if there is a material change in the actual effective tax rates or time period within which the underlying temporary differences become taxable or deductible  we could be required to establish a valuation allowance against all or a significant portion of our deferred tax assets resulting in a substantial increase in our effective tax rate and a material adverse impact on our operating results 
goodwill  intangible and other long lived assets in june  fasb issued sfas no 
and sfas no 
sfas no 
requires the purchase method of accounting for all business combinations after june  and that certain acquired intangible assets in a business combination be recognized as assets separate from goodwill 
we have applied sfas no 
in our allocation of the purchase price of the intellidata acquisition 
accordingly  we have identified and allocated a value to goodwill and other intangibles based on our judgment 
sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other intangibles determined to have an indefinite life are no longer to be amortized but are to be tested for impairment at least annually 
we have adopted sfas no 
as of october  we evaluate goodwill for impairment on an annual basis and on an interim basis if events or changes in circumstances between annual impairment tests indicate that the asset might be impaired 
we will also evaluate other intangible assets for impairment when impairment indicators are identified 
in assessing the recoverability of our goodwill and other intangibles  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
these estimates include forecasted revenues  which are inherently difficult to predict 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
historically  intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
property  equipment  intangible and certain other long lived assets are amortized over their useful lives 
useful lives are based on management s estimates of the period that the assets will generate revenue 
risk factors this form k contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of factors both in and out of our control  including the risks faced by us described below and elsewhere in this form k 
you should carefully consider the risks described below 
in addition  the risks described below are not the only ones facing us 
we have only described the risks we consider to be the most material 
however  there may be additional risks that are viewed by us as not material or are not presently known to us 

table of contents if any of the events described below were to occur  our business  prospects  financial condition and or results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
when we say below that something could or will have a material adverse effect on us  we mean that it could or will have one or more of these effects 
in any such case  the price of our common stock could decline  and you could lose all or part of your investment in our company 
risks relating to our business our operating results may fluctuate significantly and may cause our stock price to decline 
we have experienced significant variations in revenues and operating results from quarter to quarter 
our quarterly operating results may continue to fluctuate due to a number of factors  including the timing  size and complexity of our product sales and implementations  in each case exacerbated by the lengthy sales and implementation cycles and unpredictable buying patterns of our customers  overall demand for healthcare information technology  particularly in the oncology market  seasonality of our quarterly operating results  which may be impacted by the degree to which our customers have allocated and spent their yearly budgets and slower systems implementation during the holiday seasons  market acceptance of services  products and product enhancements by us and our competitors  product and price competition  changes in our operating expenses  the timing and size of future acquisitions  personnel changes  and the financial condition of our current and potential customers 
because a significant percentage of our expenses will be relatively fixed  changes in the timing of sales and implementations could cause significant variations in operating results from quarter to quarter 
we believe that period to period comparisons of our historical results of operations are not necessarily meaningful 
you should not rely on these comparisons as indicators of our future performance 
due to the length of our sales cycle  we are required to spend substantial time and expense before we are able to recognize revenue 
the sales cycle for our systems ranges from six to twenty four months or more from initial contact to contract execution  and we may require an additional three to nine months to complete implementation 
during this period  we will expend substantial time  effort and financial resources preparing contract proposals  negotiating the contract and implementing our systems 
as a result  we may not realize any revenues from some customers after expending considerable resources 
even if we do realize revenues from a project  delays in implementation may keep us from recognizing these revenues during the same period in which sales and implementation expenses were incurred 
this could cause our operating results to fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
the majority of our sales has been into the radiation oncology market 
if we are unable to expand outside the radiation oncology market or expand into international markets  our ability to grow will be limited 
sales of our products into the radiation oncology market in the united states  including maintenance and services  represented approximately of our net sales in the fiscal year ended september  many of 
table of contents the largest radiation oncology facilities and practices in the united states have previously purchased our systems 
to sustain our growth  we must expand our radiation oncology sales outside the united states and increase our sales outside of the radiation oncology market 
we have expanded our product offerings domestically to address medical oncology  hospital and central registry data aggregation and reporting  and recently  laboratory information systems and urology 
however  we may not be successful selling our products in international radiation oncology markets  or marketing our products in new markets 
if we are unable to integrate our products successfully with existing information systems and oncology treatment devices  or we are restricted from access to new device interfaces  customers may choose not to use our products and services 
for healthcare facilities to fully benefit from our products  our systems must integrate with the customer s existing information systems and medical devices 
this may require substantial cooperation  investment and coordination on the part of our customers 
there is little uniformity in the systems and devices currently used by our customers  which complicates the integration process 
if these systems are not successfully integrated  our customers could choose not to use  or to reduce their use of  our systems  which would harm our business 
our ability to design systems that integrate applications  devices and information systems has been a key to our success in the radiation oncology market 
our competitors include manufacturers of radiation oncology equipment 
if these manufacturers were to deny us access to new device interfaces  we would lose one of our key competitive advantages and our sales would be adversely impacted 
we operate in an intensely competitive market that includes companies that have greater financial  technical and marketing resources than we do  and companies who bundle their software with hardware sales at little or no additional cost  which makes it harder for us to sell our systems 
we operate in a market that is intensely competitive 
our principal oncology competitor is varian medical systems  inc we also face competition from providers of enterprise level healthcare information systems  practice management systems  general decision support and database systems and other segment specific software applications 
in addition  although we have cooperative strategic arrangements with siemens medical systems  inc and other companies for the sale of some of our products  these companies also compete with us on the sale of some of our products 
a number of existing and potential competitors are more established than we are and have greater name recognition and financial  technical and marketing resources than we do 
our most significant competitors also manufacture radiation oncology devices and other equipment used by healthcare providers who may be our potential customers 
these particular competitors pose a competitive risk for us because they market their software with their hardware products as a bundled solution at little or no additional cost  which could enhance their ability to meet a potential customer s needs 
as a result  to make a sale  we must convince potential customers that our products are sufficiently superior to the software offered by the medical device manufacturer to justify the additional costs of purchasing our products 
we also expect that competition will continue to increase  particularly if enterprise level healthcare software providers  such as cerner corporation and eclipsys corporation  choose to focus on the oncology market 
as a result of increased competition  we may need to reduce the price of our products and services  and we may experience reduced gross margins or loss of market share  any one of which could significantly reduce our future revenues and operating results 
a decline in spending for healthcare information technology and services may result in less demand for our products and services  which could adversely affect our financial results 
the purchase of our products and services involves a significant financial commitment by our customers 
the cost of our systems typically ranges from  to more than  at the same time  the healthcare industry faces significant financial pressures that could adversely affect overall spending on healthcare 
table of contents information technology and services 
for example  the balanced budget act of significantly reduced medicare reimbursements to hospitals  leaving them less money to invest in infrastructure 
moreover  a general economic decline or further reductions in medicare reimbursements to hospitals could cause hospitals to reduce or eliminate information technology related spending 
if spending for healthcare information technology and services declines or increases slower than we anticipate  demand for our products and services could decline  adversely affecting the prices we may charge 
changing customer requirements could decrease the demand for our products  which could harm our business and adversely affect our revenues 
the market for our products and services is characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards and new product introductions and enhancements that may render existing products obsolete or less competitive 
as a result  our position in the healthcare information technology market could erode rapidly due to unforeseen changes in the features  functions or pricing of competing products 
our future success will depend in part on our ability to enhance our existing products and services and to develop and introduce new products and services to meet changing customer requirements 
the process of developing products and services such as those we offer is complex and in the future is expected to become increasingly more complex and expensive as new technologies and new methods of treating cancer are introduced 
if we are unable to enhance our existing products or develop new products to meet changing customer requirements  including the introduction of new cancer treatment methods with which our products are not currently compatible  demand for our products could suffer 
we depend on our relationships with distributors and oncology equipment manufacturers to market our products  and if these relationships are discontinued  or we are unable to develop new relationships  our revenues could decline 
to successfully market and sell our products both in the united states and in foreign markets  we have developed relationships with distributors and leading oncology equipment manufacturers  including siemens medical systems  inc sales to siemens represented of our net sales in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal we rely on these collaborative relationships to augment our direct sales efforts and maintain market access to potential customers  particularly in europe and asia  and our business strategy includes entering into additional third party relationships in the future 
some of these manufacturers and distributors also produce or distribute products that directly compete with our core products 
we may not be able to maintain or develop these relationships with distributors and oncology equipment manufacturers  and these relationships may not continue to be successful 
if any of these relationships is terminated  not renewed or otherwise unsuccessful  or if we are unable to develop additional relationships  our sales could decline  and our ability to continue to grow our business could be adversely affected 
this is particularly the case for our international sales  where we rely on our distributors expertise regarding foreign regulatory matters and their access to actual and potential customers 
in many cases  these parties have extensive relationships with our existing and potential customers and influence the decisions of these customers 
in addition  if these relationships fail  we will have to devote additional resources to market our products than we would otherwise  and our efforts may not be as effective as those of the distributors and manufacturers with whom we have relationships 
we are currently investing  and plan to continue to invest  significant resources to develop these relationships 
our operating results could be adversely affected if these efforts with distributors and manufacturers do not generate revenues necessary to offset these investments 
proposed changes to medicare reimbursement policies could negatively affect oncologists  which could adversely affect their it spending decisions and our growth prospects 
sales of our it systems to oncologists  who treat cancer through the infusion of chemotherapy agents  represent a small but growing portion of our current revenue and opportunity for future growth 
as a partial offset to the cost of implementing the proposed medicare drug program  both the us house of representatives 
table of contents and senate medicare reform bills contain provisions to reduce the payment rates for drugs reimbursed under medicare part b  which includes chemotherapy drugs 
while significant changes could be introduced during the forthcoming congressional debates  if either of the plans passes in its current form  it could adversely impact the reimbursement payments made to oncologists 
while there is not necessarily a direct correlation between provider revenue and it spending  a significant decease in the part b drug reimbursement rate without a sufficient increase in provider reimbursement payments could negatively influence an oncologist s willingness to invest in new systems 
if these medicare reforms result in reduced it spending by oncologists  our growth opportunities could be adversely impacted 
we are subject to extensive federal  state and international regulations  which could cause us to incur significant costs 
four of our medical device products  including two device connectivity products and two imaging products  are subject to extensive regulation by the us food and drug administration  or fda  under the federal food  drug and cosmetic act  or fdc act  and by the food and drug branch of the california department of health services  or fdb  which is the california state agency that oversees compliance with fda regulations 
the fda s regulations govern product design and development  product testing  product labeling  product storage  premarket clearance or approval  advertising and promotion  and sales and distribution 
unanticipated changes in existing regulatory requirements or adoption of new requirements could hurt our business  financial condition and results of operations 
numerous regulatory requirements apply to our medical device products  including the fda s quality system regulations  which require that our manufacturing operations follow design  testing  process control  documentation and other quality assurance procedures during the manufacturing process 
we are also subject to fda regulations regarding labeling  adverse event reporting  and the fda s prohibition against promoting products for unapproved or off label uses 
we face the risk that a future inspection by the fda or fdb could find that we are not in full regulatory compliance 
our failure to comply with any applicable fda regulation could lead to warning letters  non approvals  suspensions of existing approvals  civil penalties and criminal fines  product seizures and recalls  operating restrictions  injunctions and criminal prosecution 
if we fail to take adequate corrective action in response to any fda observation of noncompliance  we could face enforcement actions  including a shutdown of our manufacturing operations and a recall of our products  which would cause our product sales  operating results and business reputation to suffer 
to market and sell our products in countries outside the united states  we must obtain and maintain regulatory approvals and comply with the regulations of those countries 
these regulations and the time required for regulatory review vary from country to country 
obtaining and maintaining foreign regulatory approvals is expensive and time consuming 
we plan to apply for regulatory approvals in particular countries  but we may not receive the approvals in a timely way or at all in any foreign country in which we plan to market our products  and if we fail to receive such approvals  our ability to generate revenue will be harmed 
our products could be subject to recalls even after receiving fda approval or clearance 
a recall would harm our reputation and adversely affect our operating results 
the fda  fdb and similar governmental authorities in other countries in which we market and sell our products have the authority to require the recall of our products in the event of material deficiencies or defects in design or manufacture 
a government mandated recall  or a voluntary recall by us  could occur as a result of component failures  manufacturing errors or design defects  including defects in labeling 
a recall could divert management s attention  cause us to incur significant expenses  harm our reputation with customers and negatively affect our future sales 

table of contents regulation of additional products of ours not currently subject to regulation as medical devices by the fda could increase our costs  delay the introduction of new products and adversely affect our revenue growth 
the fda has increasingly regulated computer products and computer assisted products as medical devices under the fdc act 
if the fda chooses to regulate any more of our products as medical devices  we would likely be required to take the following actions seek fda clearance by demonstrating that our product is substantially equivalent to a device already legally marketed  or obtain fda approval by establishing the safety and effectiveness of our product  comply with rigorous regulations governing pre clinical and clinical testing  manufacture  distribution  labeling and promotion of medical devices  and comply with the fdc act s general controls  including establishment registration  device listing  compliance with good manufacturing practices and reporting of specified device malfunctions and other adverse device events 
we may not be able to convince the fda to grant approval to a request for market clearance 
if any of our products fails to comply with fda requirements  we could face fda refusal to grant pre market clearance or approval of products  withdrawal of existing fda clearances and approvals  fines  injunctions or civil penalties  recalls or product corrections  production suspensions and criminal prosecution 
fda regulation of additional products could increase our operating costs  delay or prevent the marketing of new or existing products and adversely affect our revenue growth 
new and potential federal regulations relating to patient confidentiality could require us to redesign our products 
state  federal and foreign laws regulate the privacy and security of individually identifiable health information 
although compliance with these laws and regulations is presently the principal responsibility of the hospital  physician or other healthcare provider  we must ensure that our products and business operations support these requirements by providing adequate privacy and security protection to associated patient health information 
regulations governing electronic health data transmission  privacy and security are evolving rapidly and are often unclear and difficult to apply 
of particular importance is the health insurance portability and accountability act of  or hipaa 
under hipaa  the secretary of health and human services  or hhs  has adopted national data interchange standards for some types of electronic transactions and the data elements used in those transactions  adopted security standards to protect the confidentiality  integrity and availability of patient health information  and adopted privacy standards to prevent inappropriate access  use and disclosure of patient health information 
in december  hhs published the final privacy regulations  which took effect in april these regulations restrict the use and disclosure of individually identifiable health information without the prior informed consent of the patient 
in february  hhs published the final security regulations  which will take effect in april these regulations mandate that healthcare facilities implement operational  physical and technical security measures to reasonably prevent accidental  negligent or intentional inappropriate access or disclosure of patient health information 
we have made changes to our products and business operations to support these regulatory requirements 
we feel that our currently available products and operations fully support our customers requirements to comply with the above regulations 
however  hhs enforcement efforts may find that our operations and product offerings are insufficient to support our customers regulatory requirements 
a customer s failure to meet any applicable hipaa regulation could lead to fines  injunctions or criminal prosecution of the customer  which would cause our product sales and business reputation to suffer 
initial enforcement efforts and regulatory changes could also force us to redesign our products or further change our operations 
we may incur significant product development costs to modify or redesign our products to address evolving data security and privacy requirements 

table of contents we cannot predict the potential impact of any rules that have not yet been proposed or any forthcoming changes to the newly enacted rules 
in addition  other foreign  federal and or state privacy and security legislation may be enacted at any time 
if our products fail to provide accurate and timely information to our customers in their treatment of patients  our customers may be able to assert claims against us that could result in substantial costs to us  harm our reputation in the industry and cause demand for our products to decline 
we provide products that assist clinical decision making and relate to patient medical histories and treatment plans 
if these products fail to provide accurate and timely information  customers may be able to assert liability claims against us 
any potential liability claims  regardless of their outcome  could result in substantial costs to us  divert management s attention from operations and decrease market acceptance of our products 
we attempt to limit by contract our liability for damages arising from negligence  errors or mistakes 
despite this precaution  the limitations of liability set forth in our contracts may not be enforceable or may not otherwise protect us from liability for damages 
we maintain general liability insurance coverage  including coverage for errors or omissions 
however  this coverage may not continue to be available on acceptable terms or may not be available in sufficient amounts to cover one or more large claims against us 
in addition  the insurer might refuse coverage as to any future claim 
highly complex software products such as ours often contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as updates and new versions are released 
it is particularly challenging for us to test our products because it is difficult to simulate the wide variety of computing environments in which our customers may deploy them 
despite extensive testing  from time to time we have discovered defects or errors in our products 
defects  errors or difficulties could cause delays in product introductions and shipments  result in increased costs and diversion of development resources  require design modifications or decrease market acceptance or customer satisfaction with our products 
in addition  despite testing by us and by current and potential customers  errors may be found after commencement of commercial shipments  which may result in loss of or delay in market acceptance of our products 
if we undertake additional acquisitions  they may be disruptive to our business and could have an adverse effect on our future operations and cause the market price of our common stock to decline 
an element of our business strategy has been expansion through acquisitions 
since  we have completed six acquisitions of businesses or product lines 
as a result of these acquisitions  we face the following risks integrating the existing management  sales force  engineers and other personnel into one existing culture and business  developing and implementing an integrated business strategy from what had been previously independent companies  and developing compatible or complementary products and technologies from previously independent operations 
if we pursue any future acquisitions  we will also face additional risks  including the following the diversion of our management s attention and the expense of identifying and pursuing suitable acquisition candidates  whether or not consummated  the anticipated benefits from any acquisition may not be achieved  the integration of acquired businesses requires substantial attention from management  the diversion of the attention of management and any difficulties encountered in the transition process could hurt our business  
table of contents in future acquisitions  we could issue additional shares of our capital stock  incur additional indebtedness or pay consideration in excess of book value  which could have a dilutive effect on future net income  if any  per share  and the potential negative effect on our financial statements from the increase in goodwill and other intangibles  the write off of research and development costs and the high cost and expenses of completing acquisitions 
interruptions in our power supply or telecommunications capabilities or the occurrence of an earthquake or other natural disaster could disrupt our operations and cause us to lose revenues or incur additional expenses 
our primary facilities are located in california near known earthquake fault zones and are vulnerable to significant damage from earthquakes 
we are also vulnerable to damage from other types of disasters  including tornadoes  fires  floods  power loss  communications failures and similar events 
if any disaster were to occur  our ability to operate our business at our facilities could be seriously impaired or destroyed 
the insurance we maintain may not be adequate to cover our losses resulting from disasters or other business interruptions 
we currently do not have backup generators to be used as alternative sources of power in the event of a loss of power to our facilities 
during any power outage  we would be temporarily unable to continue operations at our facilities 
this would have adverse consequences for our customers who depend on us for system support and outsourcing services 
any such interruption in operations at our facilities could damage our reputation and harm our ability to obtain and retain customers  which could result in lost revenue and increased operating costs 
we have customers for whom we store and maintain critical patient and administrative data on computer servers in our application service provider  or asp  data center 
those customers access this data remotely through telecommunications lines 
if our back up power generators fail during any power outage or if our telecommunications lines are severed or impaired for any reason  those customers would be unable to access their critical data causing an interruption in their operations 
in such event our remote access customers and their patients could seek to hold us responsible for any losses 
we may also potentially lose those customers and our reputation could be harmed 
if we fail to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified technical  marketing  sales and management personnel  our ability to operate our business could be impaired 
our success depends  in significant part  upon the continued services of our key technical  marketing  sales and management personnel and on our ability to continue to attract  motivate and retain highly qualified employees 
competition for these employees is intense 
in addition  the process of recruiting personnel with the combination of skills and attributes required to operate our business can be difficult  time consuming and expensive 
the success of our business depends to a considerable degree on our senior management team 
the loss of any member of that team  particularly joseph jachinowski  james hoey or david auerbach  our founders  could hurt our business 
we depend on licenses from third parties for rights to the technology used in several of our products 
if we are unable to continue these relationships and maintain our rights to this technology  our business could suffer 
we depend upon licenses for some of the technology used in our products from a number of third party vendors  including pervasive software inc  medicomp systems  inc  first databank  inc  crystal decisions  inc 
and softvelocity  inc if we were unable to continue using the technology made available to us under these licenses on commercially reasonable terms or at all  we may have to discontinue  delay or reduce product shipments until we obtain equivalent replacement technology  which could hurt our business 
in addition  if our vendors choose to discontinue support of the licensed technology in the future  we may not be able to modify or adapt our own products 

table of contents if we fail to protect our intellectual property  our business could be harmed 
we are dependent upon our proprietary information and technology 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate to prevent misappropriation 
the laws of some foreign countries may not protect our proprietary rights as fully as do the laws of the united states 
also  despite the steps we have taken to protect our proprietary rights  it may be possible for unauthorized third parties to copy aspects of our products  reverse engineer our products or otherwise obtain and use information that we regard as proprietary 
in some limited instances  customers can access source code versions of our software  subject to contractual limitations on the permitted use of the source code 
although our license agreements with these customers attempt to prevent misuse of the source code  the possession of our source code by third parties increases the ease and likelihood of potential misappropriation of such software 
furthermore  others could independently develop technologies similar or superior to our technology or design around our proprietary rights 
in addition  infringement or invalidity claims or claims for indemnification resulting from infringement claims could be asserted or prosecuted against us 
regardless of the validity of any claims  defending against these claims could result in significant costs and diversion of our resources 
the assertion of infringement claims could also result in injunctions preventing us from distributing products 
if any claims or actions are asserted against us  we might be required to obtain a license to the disputed intellectual property rights  which might not be available on reasonable terms or at all 
our international sales  marketing and service activities expose us to uncertainties that could limit our growth and adversely affect our operating results 
in addition to our domestic operations  we currently conduct sales  marketing and service activities in other countries in north america  europe and the pacific rim 
our international operations pose risks that include potential adverse tax consequences  foreign currency fluctuations  potentially higher operating expenses  resulting from the establishment of international offices  the hiring of additional personnel and the localization and marketing of products for particular countries  the impact of smaller healthcare budgets in some international markets  which could result in greater pricing pressure and reduced gross margins  uncertainties relating to product feature requirements in foreign markets  order deposits at lower levels than historically achieved with us orders  unproven performance of new distributors  greater difficulty in collecting accounts receivable  the difficulty of building and managing an organization with geographically dispersed operations  burdens and uncertainties related to foreign laws  and lengthy sales cycles typical in overseas markets 
if we are unable to meet and overcome these challenges  our international operations may not be successful  which would limit the growth of our business 

table of contents risks related to our common stock our common stock has been publicly traded since only november  and the price of our common stock has fluctuated substantially 
our common stock has been traded on a public market for approximately twelve months 
since our initial public offering in november  the closing sales price of our common stock has ranged from a low of to a high of 
a number of factors will continue to influence the market price for the common stock following this offering  including volume and timing of orders for our products  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  changes in the availability of third party reimbursement in the united states or other countries  the announcement and introduction of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  our ability to develop  obtain regulatory clearance for  and market new and enhanced products  changes in governmental regulations or in the status of our regulatory approvals or applications  product liability claims or other litigation  changes in earnings estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  and general market conditions and other factors that may be unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
if the trading market for our stock does not continue to develop  securities analysts may not initiate or maintain research coverage of our company and our shares  and this could further depress the market for our shares 
our executive officers and directors own a significant percentage of our stock  and as a result  the trading price for our shares may be depressed and these stockholders can take actions that may be adverse to your interests 
as of november   our executive officers and directors  and persons and entities affiliated with directors  beneficially own approximately of our common stock 
these stockholders  acting together  will have the ability to significantly influence all matters requiring approval by our stockholders  including the election and removal of directors and any proposed merger  consolidation or sale of all or substantially all of our assets 
in addition  they could dictate the management of our business and affairs 
a significant concentration of share ownership can adversely affect the trading price for our common stock because investors often discount the value of stock in companies that have controlling stockholders 
furthermore  the concentration of ownership in our company could delay  defer or prevent a merger or consolidation  takeover or other business combination that could be favorable to you 
anti takeover provisions in our charter documents and delaware law could prevent a potential acquirer from buying our stock 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could delay or prevent a change in control of our company  including provisions that authorize the issuance of preferred stock that can be created and issued by the board of directors without prior stockholder approval  commonly referred to as blank check preferred stock  with rights senior to those of common stock  prohibit stockholder actions by written consent  and provide for a classified board of directors

these provisions may prohibit stockholders owning or more of our outstanding voting stock from merging or combining with us 
these and other provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws  and under delaware law  could discourage potential acquisition proposals  delay or prevent a change in control or management or reduce the price that investors might be willing to pay for shares of our common stock in the future 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
these exposures may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
we have been exposed to interest rate risk as it applies to our limited use of debt instruments and interest earned on holdings of long and short term marketable securities 
interest rates that may affect these items in the future will depend on market conditions and may differ from the rates we have experienced in the past 
a change in interest rates would not be material to our results of operations 
we reduce the sensitivity of our results of operations to these risks by maintaining an investment portfolio  which is primarily comprised of highly rated  short term investments 
we do not hold or issue derivative  derivative commodity instruments or other financial instruments for trading purposes 
we have operated mainly in the united states and greater than of our sales were made in us dollars in each of the fiscal years  and accordingly  we have not had any material exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
currently  all of our international distributors denominate all transactions in us dollars 
however  as we sell to customers in the united kingdom and europe through our uk subsidiary a majority of those sales may be denominated in euros or pounds sterling 
the functional currency of our uk subsidiary is pounds sterling 
thus  exchange rate fluctuations between the euro and pounds sterling will be recognized in the statements of operations as these foreign denominated sales are remeasured by our uk subsidiary 
as exchange rate fluctuations occur between pounds sterling and the us dollar  these fluctuations will be recorded as cumulative translation adjustments within stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss as our uk subsidiary is translated into us dollars for consolidation purposes
