item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies in response to the sec s release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  we have identified below the accounting principles critical to our business and results of operations 
we determined the critical principles by considering accounting policies that involve the most complex or subjective decisions or assessments 
we discuss these accounting policies at relevant sections in this discussion and analysis and in the notes to the consolidated financial statements contained in this annual report on form k 
in addition  we believe our most critical accounting policies include the following revenue recognition 
we install the majority of the equipment we sell 
revenues for company installed copier printer equipment and technology hardware  included in net sales  are recognized upon receipt of a signed sales contract and delivery and acceptance certificate 
the delivery and acceptance certificate confirms that the product has been delivered  installed  accepted  is in good condition  and is satisfactory 
revenues for customer installed copier printer equipment and technology hardware  included in net sales  are recognized upon receipt of a sales contract and delivery 
generally  the company does not offer any equipment warranties in addition to those which are provided by the equipment manufacturer 
revenues for sales of supplies are recognized at the time of shipment following the placement of an order from a customer 
revenues for monthly equipment service and facilities management service are recognized in the month in which the service is performed 
revenues for other services and rentals are recognized in the period performed 
the present value of payments due under sales type lease contracts is recorded as revenue within net sales and cost of goods sold is charged with the book value of the equipment when products are delivered to and accepted by the customer 
finance income is recognized over the related lease term 
supporting the company s objective to provide complete solutions to its customers  the company generally bundles a service agreement with copier printer equipment when sold 
the typical agreement includes a minimum number of copies for a base service fee plus an overage charge for any copies in excess of the minimum 
revenue for each element of a bundled contract is derived from our national price lists for equipment and service 
the national price list for equipment includes a price range between the manufacturers suggested retail price msrp and the minimum price for which our sales force is permitted to sell equipment 
the price list for equipment is updated monthly to reflect any vendor communicated changes in msrp and any changes in the fair value for which equipment is being sold to customers 
the national price list for service reflects the price of service charged to customers 
the price list for service is updated quarterly to reflect new service offerings and any changes in the competitive environment affecting the fair value for which service is being provided to customers 
the national price list  therefore  is representative of the fair value of each element of a bundled agreement when it is sold unaccompanied by the other elements 
revenue for a bundled contract is first allocated to service revenue using the fair value per our national price list 
the remaining revenue is allocated to equipment revenue and finance income based on a net present value calculation utilizing an appropriate interest rate that considers the creditworthiness of the customer  term of the lease  transaction size  and costs of financing 
the equipment revenue is compared to the national price list 
if the equipment revenue falls within the price range per the national price list  no adjustment is required 
if the equipment revenue is not within the price range per the national price list  service and equipment revenues are proportionately adjusted while holding the interest rate constant  so that both service and equipment revenues fall within the price range per the national price list 
goodwill 
ikon evaluates goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas sfas prescribes a two step method for determining goodwill impairment 
in the first step  we determine the fair value of the reporting unit using expected future discounted cash flows 
if the net book value of the reporting unit exceeds the fair value  we would then perform the second step of the impairment test which requires allocation of the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation  with any residual fair value being allocated to goodwill 
the fair value of the 
table of contents goodwill is then compared to its carrying amount to determine impairment 
if future discounted cash flows are less favorable than those anticipated  goodwill may be impaired 
inventories 
inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market using the average cost or specific identification methods and consist of finished goods available for sale 
ikon writes down its inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those anticipated  inventory adjustments may be required 
allowances for receivables 
ikon maintains allowances for doubtful accounts and lease defaults for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of ikon s customers were to significantly deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make required payments  changes to our allowances may be required 
income taxes 
income taxes are determined in accordance with sfas  which requires recognition of deferred income tax liabilities and assets for the expected future tax consequences of events that have been included in the consolidated financial statements or tax returns 
under this method  deferred income tax liabilities and assets are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and tax basis of liabilities and assets using enacted tax rates in effect for the year in which the differences are expected to reverse 
sfas also provides for the recognition of deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that the assets will be realized in future years 
a valuation allowance has been established for deferred tax assets for which realization is not likely 
in assessing the valuation allowance  ikon has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies 
however  in the event that ikon determines the value of a deferred tax asset has fluctuated from its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be necessary 
pension 
certain assumptions are used in the calculation of the actuarial valuation of our company sponsored defined benefit pension plans 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate  rates of increase in compensation levels and expected long term rates of return on assets 
if actual results are less favorable than those assumed  additional pension expense may be required 
residual values 
ikon estimates the residual value of equipment sold under sales type leases 
our residual values are based on the dollar value of the equipment and generally range between to of msrp  depending on the equipment model and lease term 
we evaluate residual values quarterly for impairment 
changes in market conditions could cause actual residual values to differ from estimated values  which could accelerate the write down of the value of the equipment 
other accounting policies 
other accounting polices  not involving the same level of significance as those discussed above  are nevertheless important to an understanding of our financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  significant accounting policies  which discusses other accounting policies 
our preparation of this annual report on form k requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates and assumptions 
in addition  certain policies described above may be modified or affected by our announced sale of certain assets and liabilities of iosc to ge see business recent developments

in the fourth quarter of  the company reversed  of prior restructuring charges see restructuring and asset impairment charges 
the reversed charges consisted of  related to severance   related to leasehold termination costs and  related to contractual commitments
