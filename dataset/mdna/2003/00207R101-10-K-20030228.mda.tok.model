item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
overview atmi is a leading supplier of materials  equipment and related services used worldwide in the manufacture of semiconductor devices 
atmi specifically targets the front end semiconductor materials market 
this market includes the processes used to convert a bare silicon wafer into a fully functional wafer that contains many copies of a semiconductor device or chip 
atmi s customers include many of the leading semiconductor manufacturers in the world 
atmi has organized its operations along two business segments materials and technologies 
the materials segment provides products that are used in the semiconductor manufacturing process and related packaging and delivery systems 
the technologies segment provides products and services that sense and environmentally control these materials while also providing specialized thin film deposition and outsourced parts cleaning and tool maintenance services to semiconductor device manufacturers 
the technologies segment also includes atmi s venture and government funded research and development activities 
the semiconductor industry  in general  and the semiconductor equipment industry  in particular  have been highly cyclical and have experienced periods of overcapacity at various times  resulting in significantly reduced demand for semiconductor materials  capital equipment and wafer processing services 
in the past two years  the semiconductor industry has experienced a severe downturn of unprecedented magnitude 
according to industry research  wafer starts at the end of had recovered to approximately of peak november levels after having fallen to of peak levels during  while equipment orders at the end of were approximately of peak september levels 
atmi s operating results have been impacted by the industry downturn  especially with regard to its product lines that track industry capacity 
revenues in the materials segment  which tends to track wafer starts  have increased in compared to  while revenues in the technologies segment have decreased in the same period 
although the decline in wafer starts throughout the industry stopped late in  there has only been modest incremental quarterly improvement in wafer starts data during however  the level of recovery in the near term is uncertain 
with regard to capital equipment spending  there remains substantial over capacity on a global basis 
management believes that the likelihood of significant advanced technology capital equipment spending due to capacity expansion is low in the near term 
due to deteriorating market conditions in the company s gallium arsenide epitaxial services product line  the company recognized an asset impairment charge of million in the third quarter of  of which million is included in cost of revenues related to a write down of inventory 
the remainder of the charge relates to long lived assets  including deposits on fixed assets 
the assets in this line of business were written down to their estimated fair value  less costs of disposal 
atmi completed one acquisition during the three years ended december   which has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
as a result  the company s consolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect the results of this acquired company 
the acquisition of the minority interest of atmi s adcs korea joint venture was accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates general management s discussion and analysis of atmi s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires atmi to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  the company evaluates its estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  marketable securities and investments  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring charges  and contingencies and litigation 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab  as amended by sab a and b 
sab requires that four basic criteria must be met before revenue can be recognized persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services rendered  the fee is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
determination of criteria and are based on management s judgments regarding the fixed nature of the fee charged for products delivered and services rendered and collectibility of those fees 
the company s revenues from product sales are recognized upon title transfer  which generally occurs upon shipment 
in instances where final acceptance of the system is specified by the customer  revenue is deferred until all acceptance criteria have been met 
service revenue is generally recognized ratably over the period of the related contract  or if not under contract  when service is provided 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine these criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
the company accrues for warranty costs  sales returns  and other allowances based on its historical experience 
should actual product failure rates or customer return experience differ from the company s estimates  revisions to the estimated accruals would be required 
bad debt the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
past due status of accounts receivable is determined primarily based upon contractual terms 
atmi grants extended payment terms  which vary based on the geographic location of the customer and range from to days 
there are no material collectibility issues with these extended term receivables 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventories the company provides inventory allowances for estimated excess  obsolescence and unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon future demand forecasts and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
marketable securities and investments the company holds minority interests in companies having operations or technology in areas within or related to its strategic focus  some of which are in publicly traded companies whose share prices are highly volatile and 
table of contents some of which are in private companies whose value is difficult to determine 
investments in private companies are included in the consolidated balance sheets under the caption other long term assets  net 
atmi records an impairment charge when it believes an investment has experienced a decline in value that is other than temporary 
future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of underlying investments could result in losses or an inability to recover the carrying value of the investments that may not be reflected in an investment s current carrying value  thereby possibly requiring an impairment charge in the future 
goodwill the company accounts for goodwill in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
changed the way companies account for goodwill in that goodwill is no longer amortized 
instead  goodwill is tested for impairment at least annually  or when certain indicators exist which could cause management to believe that goodwill could be impaired 
other identifiable intangible assets other identifiable intangible assets  such as acquired patents and trademarks and covenants not to compete  are currently amortized on the straight line method over their estimated useful lives ranging from to years 
these assets are currently reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
stock based compensation at december   the company has five stock based employee compensation plans  which are described more fully in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company accounts for these plans under the recognition and measurement principles of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
no stock based employee compensation cost is reflected in net income  as all options granted under those plans had an exercise price equal to market value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the effect on net income loss and earnings loss per share if the company had applied the fair value recognition provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to stock based employee compensation 
restructuring during the fiscal year ended december   the company recorded significant charges in connection with restructuring initiatives 
these charges include costs related to employee separation costs  plant closing costs  early lease termination expenses and various other asset and working capital write offs or write downs 
although management does not anticipate significant changes  the actual costs may differ from these estimates 
income taxes the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets assumes that the company will be able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions  based on estimates and assumptions 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  the company may be required to record additional valuation allowances against its deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in the company s consolidated statement of operations 
management evaluates the realizability of the deferred tax assets and assesses the adequacy of the valuation allowance quarterly 
likewise  in the event that the company was to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax assets would increase income in the period such determination was made

gross profit 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross margin decreased to in from in gross profit includes charges related to inventory write downs of million and million in and  respectively 
the decline in gross profit was primarily attributable to volume declines in the equipment and thin film deposition services product lines of the technologies segment  leading to lower fixed overhead cost absorption in these product lines 
as part of atmi s business realignment efforts that it announced and executed during  atmi consolidated several of its formerly autonomous business units  and certain engineering and support activities were redirected to provide field service  warranty and other customer and maintenance services which are classified as cost of revenues instead of research and development 
if the engineering and support activities had been redirected to cost of revenues in  gross margin would have been rather than 
alternatively  had these costs not been redirected  gross margin would have been in rather than  as reported 
gross profit decreased to million in from million in gross margin decreased to in compared to in the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to steep volume declines in the environmental treatment equipment  thin film deposition services  and liquid chemistry and delivery equipment product lines 
research and development expenses 
research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses decreased to in compared to in the reduction is mainly the result of the redirection of certain engineering and support activities in  as discussed above  compared to if these engineering and support activities had not been redirected in  research and development expense would have increased compared to research and development expenses increased to million in from million in as a percentage of revenues  research and development expenses increased to in from in  driven primarily by the significant revenue decline in compared to despite the semiconductor industry downturn and weakened business performance in both the materials and technologies segments  atmi continued r d spending on targeted programs to seek to ensure that the company has theproducts its customers need for future generation chip manufacturing processes  with a particular emphasis on advanced interconnect production processes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk as of december  the company s cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities included money market securities  corporate and municipal bond obligations and commercial paper 
due to the short maturity of the company s investment portfolio  an immediate change in interest rates would not have a material effect on the fair value of the company s portfolio  therefore  the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be affected to any significant degree by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates on the company s securities portfolio 
as of december   a majority of the company s debt carries fixed interest rates  therefore  the company would not expect its operating results or cash flows to be significantly affected by the effect of a sudden change in market interest rates 
foreign currency exchange risk a substantial portion of the company s sales are denominated in us dollars and  as a result  the company has relatively minimal exposure to foreign currency exchange risk with respect to sales made 
this exposure may change over time as business practices evolve and could have a material impact on the company s financial results in the future 
the company does not use forward exchange contracts to hedge exposures denominated in foreign currencies or any other derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the effect of an immediate change in exchange rates would not be expected to have a material impact on the company s future operating results or cash flows
