net sales increased million to million for the fiscal year ended march   from million for fiscal net sales reflect the invoiced amounts of products shipped and delivered and related fulfillment services provided  less discounts  allowances  rebates and sales returns 
although net sales to our wholesale club customers remained relatively flat year over year  we benefited from an increase in business with borders of in net sales for that customer as we began to supply books to additional borders stores 
overall  the increase in net sales was primarily attributable to the following factors million from the inclusion of a full twelve months of net sales of our subsidiary  pgw  as compared to two months of net sales in the prior fiscal year  million related to an increase in net sales at our international subsidiaries  primarily due to acquisitions in the uk and an additional month of activity for our uk  australia and singapore subsidiaries as a result of the synchronization of their reporting periods with ams  and million in revenue related to our retail co operative co op advertising programs  which was classified within distribution and administrative expenses in the prior fiscal year 
our return rate from customers increased percentage points to for the fiscal year ended march  from for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the softer sales environment domestically during the year and  to a lesser extent  significant customer inventory reductions during the fourth quarter 
consistent with historical practice  returns reserves have been established based on management s best estimate of expected future product returns 
these returns reserves are included in the noted return rates 
returns to publishers represented approximately of our total domestic gross purchases for both fiscal years ended march  and the publisher returns rate often exceeds the customer returns rate due to our policy of maintaining back up inventory so that we can respond promptly to customer orders 
gross profit increased million to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million for fiscal gross profit as a percentage of sales increased to during fiscal from during fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales increased primarily due to the inclusion of twelve months of pgw operations as compared to two months in the prior fiscal year and an increase in net sales for the operations of international subsidiaries that historically carry higher margins  plus the inclusion of net profit related to our co op advertising programs  which was classified within distribution and administrative expenses in the prior fiscal year  partially offset by increases in markdown expense that resulted from increased non returnable inventory levels over prior fiscal year 
distribution and administrative expenses increased million to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to from in fiscal  a percentage point increase 
the increase was driven by the inclusion of a full twelve months of pgw s higher distribution and administrative expenses  primarily labor  as compared to two months in the prior fiscal year and the reclassification of net profit related to our co op advertising programs during fiscal  which was presented within distribution and administrative expenses in the previous fiscal year 
the rest of the increase  but to a lesser extent  resulted from elevated freight  temporary labor costs  systems support costs  and depreciation expense related to the implementation of new systems and an increase in volume of small order processing 
interest income decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million during fiscal due to lower cash and investment balances as a result of continued funding of our operations in a softer sales environment and capital investments in our infrastructure 
fiscal compared to fiscal continued interest expense and other decreased million to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million during fiscal  primarily due to a million decrease in the fair value of warrants  treated as stock appreciation rights  that were issued in connection with our purchase of pgw and equity investment in raincoast books 
this was offset by an increase in interest expense of million related to higher borrowing levels in the current fiscal year

the increase in net sales was attributable to the following factors a million increase as a result of the acquisition of pgw on january   a million increase in sales from international subsidiaries  primarily in our uk subsidiary  and an million or increase in domestic shipments to core customers 
our return rate from customers increased percentage points to for the fiscal year ended march  from for fiscal the increase was primarily due to the lack of bestseller authors in absolute dollars 
fewer bestsellers caused lower gross sales  which magnified the return percentage of product 
this also makes return rates riskier  due to an increase in the placement of second tier authors  which increases the risk factor for potential returns 
consistent with historical practice  returns reserves have been established based on management s best estimate of expected future product returns 
these return reserves are included in the aforementioned return figures 
returns to publishers represented approximately and of our total domestic gross purchases for the fiscal years ended march  and  respectively

distribution and administrative expenses increased million to million for the fiscal year ended march  from million during fiscal as a percentage of net sales  these expenses increased to from in fiscal  a percentage point increase

liquidity and capital resources as of march   and  we had million  million and million in cash and cash equivalents  respectively 
the decrease in cash and cash equivalents of million in fiscal was primarily due to our funding of operations in a softer sales environment and investments in our corporate infrastructure 
the decrease of million in fiscal was primarily due to the funding of two acquisitions and the strategic growth of our corporate infrastructure offset  in part  by income from operations 
we believe that the combination of cash and cash equivalents  investment balances  the potential cash flow from operations and expected future availability on our revolving line of credit will be sufficient  at least through the next twelve months  to satisfy our cash and working capital requirements 
net cash used in operating activities amounted to million for the fiscal year ended march  the primary component of net cash used in operating activities for fiscal was an increase of million in inventories due to increased purchasing activity to meet anticipated customer demand not realized in the softer sales environment  backlog at our distribution centers as a result of higher customer returns  increased small order processing volume and inefficiencies connected with our systems implementations 
inventory turns decreased to times during fiscal as compared to times during fiscal  excluding the effect of cost of goods sold relating to pgw for comparability as only two months of pgw operations were included in fiscal the increase in inventories for fiscal was primarily funded by a corresponding increase in accounts payable of million and additional borrowings on our revolving line of credit of million

for fiscal  we plan to spend million in capital expenditures 
financing activities provided net cash of million for the fiscal year ended march   primarily a result of an additional million in borrowings against our line of credit  million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and million in proceeds from our employee stock purchase plan  offset by million liquidity and capital resources continued used to purchase treasury stock and million paid in dividends

for the fiscal year ended march   financing activities used million  of which million was used to purchase treasury stock and million paid in dividends  offset by million in proceeds from the exercise of stock options and million in proceeds from the employee stock purchase plan 
we lease facilities and some equipment under non cancelable operating leases 
rent expense for the fiscal years ended march   and amounted to approximately million  million and million  respectively 
the leases have initial expiration dates ranging from to some of the leases contain renewal options  termination options and periodic adjustments of the minimum monthly rental payments 
total future minimum lease commitments amount to approximately million based upon existing lease agreements and expiration dates  with approximate annual rent payments of million for fiscal as announced january   our board of directors approved an annual dividend payment of per share 
on march   we paid approximately million to stockholders of record on february  on january   we amended our existing  unused unsecured million line of credit to revise certain financial covenants 
additionally  at that time we entered into a secured revolving credit agreement with the same financial institution 
the secured revolving credit agreement was amended on january  to provide up to million through june  and million thereafter through its august  maturity date  as secured by eligible accounts receivable 
borrowings under both revolving credit agreements bore interest at the bank s prime rate or libor plus 
we were required to pay an unused loan fee of on any portion of the loans available but not drawn 
as of march   we had outstanding borrowings of million with a weighted average interest rate of and an additional million available  but not drawn  under our lines of credit 
fees paid during the fiscal year ended march  totaled approximately  on july   we amended our unsecured million line of credit to revise certain financial covenants and extend the maturity date to march  on september   our secured line of credit was amended to provide for a temporary increase through december  from million to million and to extend the maturity date to march  on december   our unsecured million and secured million lines of credit were retired in full and replaced by a million revolving line of credit maturing on december   secured by eligible accounts receivable

we are required to pay an unused loan fee of on any unused portions of the revolving line of credit 
as of march  we had outstanding borrowings of million with a weighted average interest rate of 
fees paid during the fiscal year ended march  totaled approximately  as of june   our borrowings were approximately million under the revolving line of credit 
the revolving line of credit agreement contains certain covenants that require the maintenance of certain financial ratios on a quarterly and annual basis 
the key ratios include tangible net worth  senior debt to ebitda  leverage and current ratios 
borrowings under this revolving line of credit agreement are collateralized by our accounts receivable balances and may not exceed of the eligible accounts receivable 
we believe that our existing working capital  cash flows from operations  trade credit traditionally available from our vendors  and refinancing of our existing lines of credit and other sources of credit will provide sufficient liquidity to cover debt service costs and any reasonably foreseeable future working capital and capital expenditure requirements associated with our existing operations 
although we have no acquisition commitments at the present time  we continue to consider additional strategic acquisitions where deemed appropriate 
such acquisitions  if any  could materially affect our future liquidity and capital resources 
we are involved in various claims and lawsuits incidental to our business  and we believe that the outcome of these matters individually and in the aggregate will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
liquidity and capital resources continued the following summarizes our contractual obligations as of march  and the effect these contractual obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flows in future periods in thousands less than after contractual obligations total year years years years line of credit   operating leases      capital lease obligations although the line of credit matures in december  we classify the instrument as a current liability as we intend to pay the outstanding balance within one year 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies are disclosed in note in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
certain of our policies require the application of judgment in making estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the consolidated financial statements and disclosures made in the accompanying notes 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories and long lived assets 
those estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience  information received from third parties and various other factors deemed to be applicable and reasonable under the circumstances 
the use of judgment in determining such estimates and assumptions is  by nature  subject to a degree of uncertainty 
accordingly  actual results could differ from estimates made 
our critical accounting policies include revenue recognition and accounts receivable we recognize revenue upon delivery of merchandise to customer locations for our wholesale distribution business and upon shipment to the customer for our contract distribution business 
included in our net sales are primarily sales of product  principally books  and to a lesser extent music cds  cd roms and prerecorded audiocassettes

our net sales also incorporate offsets for discounts  allowances  rebates and sales returns 
effective april   we record revenues related to co op advertising services provided to customers in net sales and include related expenses in cost of goods sold

we recognize revenue from our contract distribution activities on a gross basis  in accordance with emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
 reporting revenue gross as a principal versus net as an agent 
this statement provides reporting standards for revenue and costs of sales depending on a number of factors or characteristics 
we believe gross revenue reporting is appropriate because we are the primary obligor  have latitude in establishing price  can determine product specification and have credit and physical loss inventory risk 
consistent with industry practice  significant portions of our products are sold to customers with the right of return 
the level of actual returns can be influenced by many factors  including the quality of title selection  the strength and availability of the titles  as well as volatility of the ultimate sell through in the retail marketplace 
in recording adjustments to sales for estimated returns  we consider these factors as well as historical return patterns of the titles  reports of the quantities of titles at our key customer locations from our vmi system  and industry trends 
actual product returns may differ from our estimates 
we have provided allowances of million and million as of march  and  respectively  for the gross profit effect of estimated future sales returns after considering historical results and evaluating current conditions 
we record allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from our customers inability to pay amounts owed 
if the financial condition of one or more of our customers were to deteriorate  we may be required to record additional allowances or write off all or a portion of the amount due us 
we have provided allowances for uncollectible trade accounts receivable of million and million as of march  and  respectively

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  requires that impairment losses be recognized when the carrying value of an asset is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value 
our policy is to evaluate  at each balance sheet date  the appropriateness of the carrying values of long lived assets on the basis of estimated undiscounted future cash flows and other factors 
if such an evaluation were to indicate an impairment of these assets  such impairment would be recognized by a write down of the applicable asset to its estimated fair value

related party transactions we have not engaged in any related party transactions that have had a material effect on our financial position  cash flows or results of operations 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market risk is limited to interest rate risk 
our exposure to changes in interest rates relates primarily to the increase or decrease in the amount of interest income we can earn on our investment portfolio and the increase or decrease in the amount of interest expense we must pay with respect to our revolving line of credit 
our risk associated with fluctuating interest expense is limited to our borrowings under our revolving line of credit agreement and fluctuations in the prime and libor rates 
fluctuations in interest rates may affect the ending fair value of our investments  anticipated future cash flows  interest expense paid and the realization of earnings from investments 
our cash equivalents typically consist of highly liquid short term investments that are typically held for the duration of the respective instrument 
due to the short term nature of our investments  we believe that any change in interest rates would not have a material impact on our cash equivalents 
as of march   our investments scheduled to mature within one year are approximately million and our investments scheduled to mature within one to three years are approximately million 
we do not utilize derivative financial instruments or other market risk sensitive instruments  positions  or transactions to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
accordingly  we believe that  while the securities we hold are subject to changes in the financial standing of the issuer of such securities  we are not subject to any material risks arising from changes in interest rates or other market changes that affect market risk sensitive instruments 
we are subject to foreign currency exposure due to the operation of our foreign subsidiaries  which generally enter into transactions denominated in their respective functional currencies 
our primary foreign currency exposure arises from foreign denominated revenues and profits translated into us dollars 
the primary currencies to which we have foreign currency exposure are the british pound  mexican peso  and the australian  canadian and singapore dollar 
we generally view as long term our investments in our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries 
as a result  we do not utilize any hedging transactions against these net investments 
we believe that the risk associated with our foreign currency exposure is not material on a consolidated basis 
we have been subject to relatively low prevailing inflation rates in all countries in which we operate  with the exception of mexico  during fiscal  and we have generally been able to adjust our selling prices in all countries in which we operate to offset increased costs of merchandise and we expect to be able to continue to do so in the foreseeable future 
while our mexico operations are not a significant part of our overall activities  the continued high rates of inflation in mexico may result in future foreign currency exchange losses
