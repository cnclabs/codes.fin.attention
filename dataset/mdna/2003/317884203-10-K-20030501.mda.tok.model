the company is not aware of any likely events or circumstances which would result in different amounts being reported that would materially affect its financial condition or results of operations 
merchandise inventories the company values its inventories at the lower of cost or market 
the cost is determined by the last in  first out method utilizing selected producer price indices published for jewelry and watches by the bureau of labor statistics 
factors related to inventories such as future consumer demand and the economy s impact on consumer discretionary spending  inventory aging  ability to return merchandise to vendors  merchandise condition and anticipated markdowns are analyzed to determine estimated net realizable values

accordingly  a reduction or increase in vendor allowances has an inverse impact on cost of sales and or sg a 
in march  the eitf finalized issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for cash consideration received from a vendor 
eitf addresses the accounting treatment for vendor allowances and provides that cash consideration received from a vendor should be presumed to be a reduction of the prices of the vendors product and should therefore be shown as a reduction in the purchase price of the merchandise 
further  these allowances should be recognized as a reduction in cost of sales when the related product is sold 
to the extent that the cash consideration represents a reimbursement of a specific  incremental and identifiable cost  then those vendor allowances should be used to offset such costs 
in accordance with eitf  the company recorded a cumulative effect of accounting change as of february   the date of adoption  that decreased net income for by million  net of tax  or per share  on a diluted basis 
as of february   deferred vendor allowances totaled i  for owned merchandise  and ii  for merchandise received on consignment 
as of february   the company s fiscal year end  deferred vendor allowances totaled i  for owned merchandise  which is included as an offset to merchandise inventories on the consolidated balance sheet  and ii  for merchandise received on consignment  which is included as deferred income on the consolidated balance sheet
