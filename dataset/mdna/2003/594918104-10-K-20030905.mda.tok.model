licensing simplifies and improves our volume licensing program with software assurance  which gives customers the right to install any new release of products covered in the licensing agreement during the term of their coverage 
the level of customer adoption of our new volume licensing programs will affect the mix of multi year licensing agreements with a resulting impact on the timing of revenue recognition

non operating items  investment income loss  and income taxes non operating items losses on equity investees and other consist of our share of income or loss from investments accounted for using the equity method  and income or loss attributable to minority interests

the increase in losses on equity investees and other in fiscal reflected an increase in the number of such investments during the year 
investment income loss we recorded net investment income loss in each year as follows in millions year ended june dividends interest net recognized gains losses on investments net gains on the sales of investments other than temporary impairments net unrealized losses attributable to derivative instruments net recognized gains losses on investments investment income loss investments are considered to be impaired when a decline in fair value is judged to be other than temporary 
we employ a systematic methodology that considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of our investments 
if the cost of an investment exceeds its fair value  we evaluate  among other factors  general market conditions  the duration and extent to which the fair value is less than cost  as well as our intent and ability to hold the investment 
we also consider specific adverse conditions related to the financial health of and business outlook for the investee  including industry and sector performance  changes in technology  operational and financing cash flow factors  and rating agency actions 
once a decline in fair value is determined to be other than temporary  an impairment charge is recorded and a new cost basis in the investment is established

table of contents part ii  item income taxes our effective tax rate for fiscal was  reflecting a one time benefit in the second quarter of million from the reversal of previously accrued taxes 
the tax reversal stems from a th circuit court of appeals ruling in december overturning a previous tax court ruling that had denied tax benefits on certain revenue earned from the distribution of software to foreign customers 
excluding this reversal  the effective tax rate would have been 
the effective tax rate for fiscal and fiscal was and  respectively 
accounting changes effective july   we adopted sfas  business combinations  and sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas requires business combinations to be accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
it also specifies the types of acquired intangible assets that are required to be recognized and reported separate from goodwill 
sfas requires that goodwill and certain intangibles no longer be amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
there was no impairment of goodwill upon adoption of sfas goodwill amortization on a pre tax basis was million in fiscal effective july   we adopted sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  which establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts and for hedging activities 
the adoption of sfas resulted in a cumulative pre tax reduction to income of million million after tax and a cumulative pre tax reduction to other comprehensive income oci of million million after tax

stock based compensation on july   we announced changes in employee compensation designed to help us continue to attract and retain the best employees  and to better align employee interests with those of our shareholders 
employees will be granted stock awards instead of stock options 
the stock award program offers employees the opportunity to earn actual shares of our stock over time  rather than options that give employees the right to purchase stock at a set price 
as part of the changes  we announced that a significant portion of stock based compensation for more than of our senior leaders will depend on growth in the number and satisfaction of our customers 
we also indicated that we are working on a plan to enable employees to realize some value on the portion of their stock options that are currently out of the money  by selling their options to a third party financial institution

stockholders equity at june  was billion 
we will continue to invest in sales  marketing  product support infrastructure  and existing and advanced areas of technology 
additions to property and equipment will continue  including new facilities and computer systems for r d  sales and marketing  support  and administrative staff 
commitments for constructing new buildings were million on june  we have not engaged in any related party transactions or arrangements with unconsolidated entities or other persons that are reasonably likely to materially affect liquidity or the availability of or requirements for capital resources 
we believe existing cash and short term investments together with funds generated from operations should be sufficient to meet operating requirements 
our philosophy regarding the maintenance of a balance sheet with a large component of cash and short term investments  as well as equity and other investments  reflects our views on potential future capital requirements relating to research and development  creation and expansion of sales distribution channels  investments and acquisitions  share dilution management  legal risks  and challenges to our business model 
we continuously assess our investment management approach in view of our current and potential future needs 
off balance sheet arrangements we have operating leases for most us and international sales and support offices and certain equipment 
rental expense for operating leases was million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
future minimum rental commitments under noncancellable leases  in millions of dollars  are           and thereafter  we have unconditionally guaranteed the repayment of certain japanese yen denominated bank loans and related interest and fees of jupiter telecommunication  ltd  a japanese cable company jupiter 
these guarantees arose on february  in conjunction with the expiration of prior financing arrangements  including previous guarantees by us 
the financing arrangements were entered into by jupiter as part of financing its operations 
as part of jupiter s new financing agreement  we agreed to guarantee repayment by jupiter of the loans of approximately million 
the estimated fair value and the carrying value of the guarantees was million and did not result in a charge to operations 
the guarantees are in effect until the earlier of repayment of the loans  including accrued interest and fees  or february  the maximum amount of the guarantees is limited to the sum of the total due and unpaid principal amounts  accrued and unpaid interest  and any other related expenses 
additionally  the maximum amount of the guarantees  denominated in japanese yen  will vary based on fluctuations in foreign exchange rates 
if we were required to make payments under the guarantees  we may recover all or a portion of those payments upon liquidation of jupiter s assets 
the proceeds from such liquidation cannot be accurately estimated due to the multitude of factors that would affect the valuation and realization of the proceeds in the event of liquidation 
in connection with various operating leases  we issued residual value guarantees  which provide that if we do not purchase the leased property from the lessor at the end of the lease term  then we are liable to the lessor for an amount equal to the shortage if any between the proceeds from the sale of the property and an agreed value 
as of june   the maximum amount of the residual value guarantees was approximately million 
we believe that proceeds from the sale of properties under operating leases would exceed the payment obligation and therefore no liability to us currently exists 
we provide indemnifications of varying scope and size to certain customers against claims of intellectual property infringement made by third parties arising from the use of our products 
we evaluate estimated losses for such indemnifications under sfas  accounting for contingencies  as interpreted by fin we consider such factors as the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
to date  we have not encountered material costs as a result of such obligations and have not accrued any liabilities related to such indemnifications in our financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards in january  the fasb issued interpretation  consolidation of variable interest entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
interpretation requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of interpretation apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to transactions entered into prior to february  in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
the adoption of the interpretation on july  did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities  which amends and clarifies accounting for derivative instruments  including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts  and for hedging activities under sfas the statement is effective with certain exceptions for contracts entered into or modified after june  we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements 
in may  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with msft form k 
table of contents part ii  item characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classify a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
it is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june  while we do not believe the adoption of this statement will have a material impact on our financial statements  we continue to assess the impact this statement will have on certain of our share repurchase programs 
application of critical accounting policies our financial statements and accompanying notes are prepared in accordance with us gaap 
preparing financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue  and expenses 
these estimates and assumptions are affected by management s application of accounting policies 
critical accounting policies for us include revenue recognition  impairment of investment securities  impairment of goodwill  accounting for research and development costs  accounting for legal contingencies  and accounting for income taxes 
we account for the licensing of software in accordance with american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  software revenue recognition 
the application of sop requires judgment  including whether a software arrangement includes multiple elements  and if so  whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for those elements 
end users receive certain elements of our products over a period of time 
these elements include free post delivery telephone support and the right to receive unspecified upgrades enhancements of microsoft internet explorer on a when and if available basis  the fair value of which is recognized over the product s estimated life cycle 
changes to the elements in a software arrangement  the ability to identify vsoe for those elements  the fair value of the respective elements  and changes to a product s estimated life cycle could materially impact the amount of earned and unearned revenue 
judgment is also required to assess whether future releases of certain software represent new products or upgrades and enhancements to existing products 
sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and securities and exchange commission sec staff accounting bulletin sab  accounting for noncurrent marketable equity securities  provide guidance on determining when an investment is other than temporarily impaired 
this determination requires significant judgment 
in making this judgment  we evaluate  among other factors  the duration and extent to which the fair value of an investment is less than its cost  the financial health of and near term business outlook for the investee  including factors such as industry and sector performance  changes in technology  and operational and financing cash flow  and our intent and ability to hold the investment 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  requires that goodwill be tested for impairment at the reporting unit level operating segment or one level below an operating segment on an annual basis july st for microsoft and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
application of the goodwill impairment test requires judgment  including the identification of reporting units  assigning assets and liabilities to reporting units  assigning goodwill to reporting units  and determining the fair value of each reporting unit 
significant judgments required to estimate the fair value of reporting units include estimating future cash flows  determining appropriate discount rates and other assumptions 
changes in these estimates and assumptions could materially affect the determination of fair value and or goodwill impairment for each reporting unit 
we account for research and development costs in accordance with several accounting pronouncements  including sfas  accounting for research and development costs  and sfas  accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
sfas specifies that costs incurred internally in creating a computer software product should be charged to expense when incurred as research and development until technological feasibility has been established for the product 
once technological feasibility is established  all software costs should be capitalized until the product is available for general release to customers 
judgment is required in determining when technological feasibility of a product is established 
we have determined that technological feasibility for our products is reached shortly before the products are released to manufacturing 
costs incurred after technological feasibility is established are not material  and accordingly  we expense all research and development costs when incurred 
we are subject to various legal proceedings and claims  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
sfas  accounting for contingencies  requires that an estimated loss from a loss contingency should be accrued by a charge to income if it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated 
disclosure of a contingency is required if there is at least a reasonable possibility that a loss has been incurred 
we evaluate  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome and the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss 
changes in these factors could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
sfas  accounting for income taxes  establishes financial accounting and reporting standards for the effect of income taxes 
the objectives of accounting for income taxes are to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
fluctuations in the actual outcome of these future tax consequences could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
issues and uncertainties this annual report on form k contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of issues and uncertainties such as those listed below and elsewhere in this report  which  among others  should be considered in evaluating our financial outlook 
challenges to our business model since our inception  our business model has been based upon customers agreeing to pay a fee to license software developed and distributed by us 
under this commercial software model  software developers bear the costs of converting original ideas into software products through investments in research and development  offsetting these costs with the revenues received from the distribution of their products 
we believe the commercial software model has had substantial benefits for users of software  allowing them to rely on our expertise and the expertise of other software developers that have powerful incentives to develop msft form k 
table of contents part ii  item innovative software that is useful  reliable  and compatible with other software and hardware 
in recent years  there has been a growing challenge to the commercial software model  often referred to as the open source model 
under the open source model  software is produced by loosely associated groups of unpaid programmers  and the resulting software and the intellectual property contained therein is licensed to end users at substantially no cost 
the most notable example of open source software is the linux operating system 
while we believe that our products provide customers with significant advantages in security and productivity  and generally have a lower total cost of ownership than open source software  the popularization of the open source model continues to pose a significant challenge to our business model  including recent efforts by proponents of the open source model to convince governments worldwide to mandate the use of open source software in their purchase and deployment of software products 
to the extent the open source model gains increasing market acceptance  sales of our products may decline  we may have to reduce the prices we charge for our products  and revenues and operating margins may consequently decline 
intellectual property rights we defend our intellectual property rights  but unlicensed copying and use of software and intellectual property rights represents a loss of revenue to us 
while this adversely affects us revenue  the impact on revenue from outside the united states is more significant  particularly in countries where laws are less protective of intellectual property rights 
throughout the world  we actively educate consumers about the benefits of licensing genuine products and educate lawmakers about the advantages of a business climate where intellectual property rights are protected 
however  continued educational and enforcement efforts may not affect revenue positively and further deterioration in compliance with existing legal protections or reductions in the legal protection for intellectual property rights of software developers could adversely affect revenue 
from time to time we receive notices from others claiming we infringe their intellectual property rights 
the number of these claims may grow 
responding to these claims may require us to enter into royalty and licensing agreements on unfavorable terms  require us to stop selling or to redesign affected products  or to pay damages or to satisfy indemnification commitments with our customers 
we have made and expect to continue making significant expenditures to acquire the use of technology and intellectual property rights  including via cross licenses of broad patent portfolios 
new products and services we have made significant investments in research  development and marketing for new products  services and technologies  including microsoft 
net  xbox  business applications  msn  mobile and wireless technologies  and television 
significant revenue from new product and service investments may not be achieved for a number of years  if at all 
moreover  these products and services may never be profitable  and even if they are profitable  operating margins for these businesses are not expected to be as high as the margins historically experienced by us 
litigation as discussed in note contingencies of the notes to financial statements  we are subject to a variety of claims and lawsuits 
while we believe that none of the litigation matters in which we are currently involved will have a material adverse impact on our financial position or results of operations  it is possible that one or more of these matters could be resolved in a manner that ultimately would have a material adverse impact on our business  and could negatively impact our revenues  operating margins  and net income 
declines in demand for software if overall market demand for pcs  servers and other computing devices declines significantly  or consumer or corporate spending for such products declines  our revenue will be adversely affected 
additionally  our revenues would be unfavorably impacted if customers reduce their purchases of new software products or upgrades to existing products because new product offerings are not perceived as adding significant new functionality or other value to prospective purchasers 
a significant number of customers purchased license agreements providing upgrade rights to specific licensed products prior to the transition to licensing in july these agreements will expire in and and the rate at which such customers renew these contracts could adversely affect future revenues 
we are also committing significant investments in the next release of the windows operating system  codenamed longhorn 
if this system is not perceived as offering significant new functionality or value to prospective purchasers  our revenues and operating margins could be adversely affected 
product development schedule the development of software products is a complex and time consuming process 
new products and enhancements to existing products can require long development and testing periods 
significant delays in new product releases or significant problems in creating new products  particularly any delays in the longhorn operating system  could adversely affect our revenues 
general economic and geo political risks continued softness in corporate information technology spending or other changes in general economic conditions that affect demand for computer hardware or software could adversely affect our revenues 
terrorist activity and armed conflict pose the additional risk of general economic disruption and could require changes in our international operations and security arrangements  thus increasing our operating costs 
these conditions lend additional uncertainty to the timing and budget for technology investment decisions by our customers 
competition we continue to experience intensive competition across all markets for our products and services 
these competitive pressures may result in decreased sales volumes  price reductions  and or increased operating costs  such as for marketing and sales incentives  resulting in lower revenues  gross margins and operating income 
taxation of extraterritorial income in august  a world trade organization wto dispute panel determined that the tax provisions of the fsc repeal and extraterritorial income exclusion act of eti constitute an export subsidy prohibited by the wto agreement on subsidies msft form k 
table of contents part ii  item  a and countervailing measures 
the us government appealed the panel s decision and lost its appeal 
if the eti provisions are repealed and financially comparable replacement tax legislation is not enacted  the loss of the eti tax benefit to us could be significant 
other potential tax liabilities we are subject to income taxes in both the united states and numerous foreign jurisdictions 
significant judgment is required in determining our worldwide provision for income taxes 
in the ordinary course of our business  there are many transactions and calculations where the ultimate tax determination is uncertain 
we are regularly under audit by tax authorities 
although we believe our tax estimates are reasonable  the final determination of tax audits and any related litigation could be materially different than that which is reflected in historical income tax provisions and accruals 
should additional taxes be assessed as a result of an audit or litigation  a material effect on our income tax provision and net income in the period or periods for which that determination is made could result 
finite insurance programs in addition to conventional third party insurance arrangements  we have entered into captive insurance arrangements for the purpose of protecting against possible catastrophic and other risks not covered by traditional insurance markets 
as of june   potential coverage available under captive insurance arrangements was billion  subject to deductibles  exclusions  and other restrictions 
while we believe these arrangements are an effective way to insure against such risks  the potential liabilities associated with certain of the issues and uncertainties discussed herein could exceed the coverage provided by such arrangements 
other other issues and uncertainties may include warranty and other claims for hardware products such as xbox  the effects of the consent decree in us v 
microsoft and final judgment in state of new york v 
microsoft on the windows operating system and server business  including those associated with protocol and other disclosures required by the decree and final judgment and the ability of pc manufacturers to hide end user access to certain new windows features  the continued availability of third party distribution channels for msn service and other online services  factors associated with our international operations  as described under international operations in part i  item of this report  and financial market volatility or other changes affecting the value of our investments  such as the comcast corporation securities held by us  that may result in a reduction in carrying value and recognition of losses including impairment charges 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to foreign currency  interest rate  and fixed income and equity price risks 
a portion of these risks is hedged  but fluctuations could impact our results of operations and financial position 
we hedge a portion of anticipated revenue and accounts receivable exposure to foreign currency fluctuations  primarily with option contracts 
we monitor our foreign currency exposures daily to maximize the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
principal currencies hedged include the euro  japanese yen  british pound  and canadian dollar 
fixed income securities are subject to interest rate risk 
the portfolio is diversified and structured to minimize credit risk 
we routinely use options to hedge a portion of our exposure to interest rate risk in the event of a catastrophic increase in interest rates 
securities held in our equity and other investments portfolio are subject to price risk  and are generally not hedged 
however  we use options to hedge our price risk on certain highly volatile equity securities that are held primarily for strategic purposes 
we use a value at risk var model to estimate and quantify our market risks 
var is the expected loss  for a given confidence level  in fair value of our portfolio due to adverse market movements over a defined time horizon 
the var model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value  but is used as a risk estimation and management tool 
the model used for currencies and equities is geometric brownian motion  which allows incorporation of optionality with regard to these risk exposures 
for interest rate risk  the mean reverting geometric brownian motion is used to reflect the principle that fixed income securities prices revert to maturity value over time 
value at risk is calculated by  first  simulating  market price paths over days for equities  interest rates and foreign exchange rates  taking into account historical correlations among the different rates and prices 
each resulting unique set of equities prices  interest rates  and foreign exchange rates is applied to substantially all individual holdings to re price each holding 
the th worst performance out of  represents the value at risk over days at the th percentile confidence level 
several risk factors are not captured in the model  including liquidity risk  operational risk  credit risk  and legal risk 
certain securities in our equity portfolio are held for strategic purposes 
we hedge the value of a portion of these securities through the use of derivative contracts such as put call collars 
in these arrangements  we hedge a security s market risk below the purchased put strike and forgo most or all of the benefits of the security s appreciation above the sold call strike  in exchange for premium received for the sold call 
we also hold equity securities for general investment return purposes 
we have incurred material impairment charges related to these securities 
the var amounts disclosed below are used as a risk management tool and reflect an estimate of potential reductions in fair value of our portfolio 
losses in fair value over a day holding period can exceed the reported var by significant amounts and can also accumulate over a longer time horizon than the day holding period used in the var analysis 
var amounts are not necessarily reflective of potential accounting losses  including determinations of other than temporary losses in fair value in accordance with us gaap 
the var numbers are shown separately for interest rate  currency  and equity risks 
these var numbers include the underlying portfolio positions and related hedges 
we use historical data to estimate var 
given reliance on historical data  var is most effective in estimating risk exposures in markets in which there are no fundamental changes or shifts in market conditions 
an inherent limitation in var is that the distribution of past changes in market risk factors may not produce accurate predictions of future market risk 
msft form k 
table of contents part ii  item a  the following table sets forth the var calculations for substantially all of our positions in millions as of june year ended june  risk categories average high low interest rates currency rates equity prices the total var for the combined risk categories is million at june  and million at june  the total var is less at june  and less at june  than the sum of the separate risk categories for each of those years in the above table  due to the diversification benefit of the combination of risks 
the reasons for the change in risk in portfolios include larger investment portfolio size  asset allocation shifts  and changes in foreign exchange exposures relative to the us dollar
