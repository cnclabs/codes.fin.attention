item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the accompanying consolidated financial statements and notes to consolidated financial statements contain information that is pertinent to management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and the related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company believes that the critical accounting policies and estimates discussed below involve additional management judgment due to the sensitivity of the methods and assumptions necessary in determining the related asset  liability  revenue and expense amounts 
revenue recognition kodak recognizes revenue when it is realized or realizable and earned 
for the sale of multiple element arrangements whereby equipment is combined with services  including maintenance and training  and other elements  including software and products  the company allocates to  and recognizes revenue from  the various elements based on verifiable objective evidence of fair value if software is not included or is incidental to the transaction or kodak specific objective evidence of fair value if software is included and is other than incidental to the sales transaction as a whole 
for full service solutions sales  which consist of the sale of equipment and software which may or may not require significant production  modification or customization  there are two acceptable methods of accounting percentage of completion accounting and completed contract accounting 
for certain of the company s full service solutions  the completed contract method of accounting is being followed by the company 
this is due to insufficient historical experience resulting in the inability to provide reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and costs applicable to the various stages of such contracts as would be necessary under the percentage of completion methodology 
when the company does have sufficient historical experience and the ability to provide reasonably dependable estimates of the revenues and the costs applicable to the various stages of these contracts  the company will account for these full service solutions under the percentage of completion methodology 
the company records reductions to revenue for customer incentive programs offered including cash and volume discounts  price protection  promotional  cooperative and other advertising allowances  slotting fees and coupons 
the liability for the incentive programs is recorded at the time of sale 
the company determines the amount of the incentives that are based on estimates by using historical experience and internal and customer data 
to the extent actual experience differs from estimates  additional reductions to revenue could be recorded 
if market conditions were to decline  the company may take actions to expand these customer offerings  which may result in incremental reductions to revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts kodak regularly analyzes its customer accounts and  when it becomes aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to the company  such as in the case of bankruptcy filings or deterioration in the customer s overall financial condition  records a specific provision for uncollectible accounts to reduce the related receivable to the amount that is estimated to be collectible 
the company also records and maintains a provision for doubtful accounts for customers based on a variety of factors including the company s historical experience  the length of time the receivable has been outstanding and the financial condition of the customer 
if circumstances related to specific customers were to change  the company s estimates with respect to the collectibility of the related receivables could be further adjusted 
however  losses in the aggregate have not exceeded management s expectations 
inventories kodak reduces the carrying value of its inventory based on estimates of what is excess  slow moving and obsolete  as well as inventory whose carrying value is in excess of net realizable value 
these write downs are based on current assessments about future demands  market conditions and related management initiatives 
if  in the future  the company determined that market conditions and actual demands are less favorable than those projected and  therefore  inventory was overvalued  the company would be required to further reduce the carrying value of the inventory and record a charge to earnings at the time such determination was made 
however  if in the future the company determined that inventory write downs were overstated and  therefore  inventory was undervalued  the company would recognize the increase to earnings through higher gross profit at the time the related undervalued inventory was sold 
however  actual results have not differed materially from management s estimates 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets the company reviews the carrying value of its long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets  for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
the company assesses the recoverability of the carrying value of long lived assets  other than goodwill and purchased intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  by first grouping its long lived assets with other assets and liabilities at the lowest level for which identifiable cash flows are largely independent of the cash flows of other assets and liabilities the asset group and  secondly  estimating the undiscounted future cash flows that are directly associated with and expected to arise from the use of and eventual disposition of such asset group 
the company estimates the undiscounted cash flows over the remaining useful life of the primary asset within the asset group 
if the carrying value of the asset group exceeds the estimated undiscounted cash flows  the company records an impairment charge to the extent the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
the company determines fair value through quoted market prices in active markets or  if quoted market prices are unavailable  through the performance of internal analysis of discounted cash flows or external appraisals 
the undiscounted and discounted cash flow analyses are based on a number of estimates and assumptions  including the expected period over which the asset will be utilized  projected future operating results of the asset group  discount rate and long term growth rate 
to assess goodwill for impairment  the company performs an assessment of the carrying value of its reporting units on an annual basis or when events and changes in circumstances occur that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of the company s reporting units below their carrying value 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  the company would perform the second step in its assessment process and would record an impairment charge to earnings to the extent the carrying amount of the reporting unit goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
the company estimates the fair value of its reporting units through internal analysis and external valuations  which utilize income and market valuation approaches through the application of capitalized earnings  discounted cash flow and market comparable methods 
these valuation techniques are based on a number of estimates and assumptions  including the projected future operating results of the reporting unit  discount rate  long term growth rate and appropriate market comparables 
the company s assessments of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets  and its periodic review of the remaining useful lives of its long lived assets are an integral part of kodak s ongoing strategic review of the business and operations  and are also performed in conjunction with the company s periodic restructuring actions 
therefore  future changes in the company s strategy  the ongoing digital substitution  the continuing shift from overnight photofinishing to onsite processing and other changes in the operations of the company could impact the projected future operating results that are inherent in the company s estimates of fair value  resulting in impairments in the future 
additionally  other changes in the estimates and assumptions  including the discount rate and expected long term growth rate  which drive the valuation techniques employed to estimate the fair value of long lived assets and goodwill could change and  therefore  impact the assessments of impairment in the future 
in performing the annual assessment of goodwill for impairment  the company determined that none of the reporting units carrying values were close to exceeding their respective fair values 
see goodwill under note  significant accounting policies 
investments in equity securities kodak holds minority interests in certain publicly traded and privately held companies having operations or technology within its strategic area of focus 
the company s policy is to record an impairment charge on these investments when they experience declines in value that are considered to be other than temporary 
poor operating results of the investees or adverse changes in market conditions in the future may cause losses or an inability of the company to recover its carrying value in these underlying investments 
the remaining carrying value of the company s investments in these equity securities is million at december  income taxes the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
at december   the company has deferred tax assets for its net operating loss and foreign tax credit carryforwards of million and million  respectively  relating to which the company has a valuation allowance of million and million  respectively 
the company has considered future market growth  forecasted earnings  future taxable income  the mix of earnings in the jurisdictions in which the company operates and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in determining the need for these valuation allowances 
if kodak were to determine that it would not be able to realize a portion of its net deferred tax asset in the future for which there is currently no valuation allowance  an adjustment to the net deferred tax assets would be charged to earnings in the period such determination was made 
conversely  if the company were to make a determination that it is more likely than not that the deferred tax assets for which there is currently a valuation allowance would be realized  the related valuation allowance would be reduced and a benefit to earnings would be recorded 
the company s effective tax rate considers the impact of undistributed earnings of subsidiary companies outside the us deferred taxes have not been provided for the potential remittance of such undistributed earnings  as it is the company s policy to permanently reinvest its retained earnings 
however  from time to time and to the extent that the company can repatriate overseas earnings on a tax free basis  the company will pay dividends to the us material changes in the company s working capital and long term investment requirements could impact the level and source of future remittances and  as a result  the company s effective tax rate 
see note  income taxes 
the company operates within multiple taxing jurisdictions and is subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
these audits can involve complex issues  which may require an extended period of time for resolution 
although management believes that adequate provision has been made for such issues  there is the possibility that the ultimate resolution of such issues could have an adverse effect on the earnings of the company 
conversely  if these issues are resolved favorably in the future  the related provisions would be reduced  thus having a positive impact on earnings 
warranty obligations management estimates expected product failure rates  material usage and service costs in the development of its warranty obligations 
in the event that the actual results of these items differ from the estimates  an adjustment to the warranty obligation would be recorded 
pension and postretirement benefits kodak s defined benefit pension and other postretirement benefit costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used by actuaries in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions  which are reviewed annually by the company  include the discount rate  long term expected rate of return on plan assets  salary growth  healthcare cost trend rate and other economic and demographic factors 
the company bases the discount rate assumption for its significant plans on the estimated rate at which annuity contracts could be purchased to discharge the pension benefit obligation 
in estimating that rate  the company looks to the aa rated corporate long term bond yield rate in the respective country as of the last day of the year in the company s reporting period as a guide 
the long term expected rate of return on plan assets is based on a combination of formal asset allocation studies  historical results of the portfolio and management s expectation as to future returns that are expected to be realized over the estimated remaining life of the plan liabilities that will be funded with the plan assets 
the salary growth assumptions are determined based on the company s long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
the healthcare cost trend rate assumptions are based on historical cost and payment data  the near term outlook and an assessment of the likely long term trends 
the company evaluates its expected long term rate of return on plan asset eroa assumption annually for the kodak retirement income plan krip 
to facilitate this evaluation  every two to three years  or when market conditions change materially  the company undertakes a new asset liability study to reaffirm the current asset allocation and the related eroa assumption 
wilshire associates  a consulting firm  completed a study the study in september  which led to several asset allocation shifts and a decrease in the eroa from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  this factor  coupled with a decrease in the discount rate of basis points from for to for  and the fact that the transition asset  which provided approximately million of income in  is fully amortized as of december   is expected to lower total pension income in the us from million in to pension income in the range of million to million in this decrease in income will be partially offset by a decrease in pension expense in the company s non us plans in the range of million to million 
additionally  the company increased its healthcare cost trend rate assumption with respect to the company s most significant postretirement plan  the us plan  from for  decreasing to by as discussed in the company s annual report on form k  to for  decreasing to by this increase in the healthcare cost trend rate assumption  coupled with the decrease in the discount rate  is expected to increase the cost of this plan from million in to range of million to million in all these factors have been incorporated into the company s earnings outlook for actual results that differ from our assumptions are recorded as unrecognized gains and losses and are amortized to earnings over the estimated future service period of the plan participants to the extent such total net recognized gains and losses exceed of the greater of the plan s projected benefit obligation or the market related value of assets 
significant differences in actual experience or significant changes in future assumptions would affect the company s pension and postretirement benefit costs and obligations 
in accordance with the guidance under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 the company is required to record an additional minimum pension liability in its consolidated statement of financial position that is at least equal to the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation of its defined benefit pension plans 
in the fourth quarter of  due to the decreasing discount rates and the weak performance of the global equity markets in  the company increased its net additional minimum pension liability by million and recorded a corresponding charge to accumulated other comprehensive income a component of stockholders equity of million  net of taxes of million 
if discount rates and the global equity markets performance continue to decline  the company may be required to increase its additional minimum pension liabilities and record further charges to stockholders equity in the future 
likewise  if discount rates increase and the performance of the global equity markets improve  the company could be in a position to reduce its minimum pension liability and reverse the corresponding charges to equity 
environmental commitments environmental liabilities are accrued based on estimates of known environmental remediation exposures 
the liabilities include accruals for sites owned by kodak  sites formerly owned by kodak  and other third party sites where kodak was designated as a potentially responsible party prp 
the amounts accrued for such sites are based on these estimates  which are determined using the astm standard e standard guide for estimating monetary costs and liabilities for environmental matters 
the overall method includes the use of a probabilistic model that forecasts a range of cost estimates for the remediation required at individual sites 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for remediation and long term monitoring of the sites 
such estimates may be affected by changing determinations of what constitutes an environmental liability or an acceptable level of remediation 
the company has an ongoing monitoring and identification process to assess how the activities with respect to the known exposures are progressing against the accrued cost estimates  as well as to identify other potential remediation sites that are presently unknown 
to the extent that the current work plans are not effective in achieving targeted results  the proposals to regulatory agencies for desired methods and outcomes of remediation are not acceptable  or additional exposures are identified  kodak s estimate of its environmental liabilities may change

the increase in other charges is primarily attributable to increased losses from the company s nexpress and sk display joint ventures as these business ventures are in the early stages of bringing their offerings to market  higher non strategic venture investment impairments  higher losses related to minority interests and an increase in foreign exchange losses 
this activity was partially offset by a gain recognized on the sale of assets in the current year 
the company s effective tax rate from continuing operations decreased from for to for the effective tax rate from continuing operations of for is less than the us statutory rate of primarily due to the charges for the focused cost reductions and asset impairments being deducted in jurisdictions that have a higher tax rate than the us federal income tax rate  and also due to discrete period tax benefits of approximately million relating to the closure and restructuring of certain of the company s business activities and other one time items  which were partially offset by the impact of recording a valuation allowance to provide for certain tax benefits that the company would be required to forgo in order to fully realize the benefits of its foreign tax credit carryforwards

in the third quarter of  the company reversed million of the original million in severance charges due primarily to higher rates of attrition than originally expected  lower utilization of training and outplacement services by terminated employees than originally expected and termination actions being completed at an actual cost per employee that was lower than originally estimated 
as a result  approximately fewer employees will be terminated  including in service and photofinishing  in administrative and in r d

the net cash provided by operating activities of  million for the year ended december  was partially attributable to net earnings of million which  when adjusted for depreciation and amortization  and restructuring costs  asset impairments and other charges  provided  million of operating cash  a decrease in accounts receivable of million  a decrease in inventories of million  proceeds from the surrender of its company owned life insurance policies of million  and an increase in liabilities excluding borrowings of million  related primarily to severance payments for restructuring programs

of the million expended  million was repurchased under the stock repurchase program  which is now completed 
the balance of the amount expended of million was repurchased under the stock repurchase program

for the full year  the company expects its capital spending  excluding acquisitions and equipment purchased for lease  to be approximately million 
the cash outflows for severance and exit costs associated with the restructuring charges recorded in will be more than offset by the tax savings associated with the restructuring actions  primarily due to the tax benefit of million relating to the consolidation of its photofinishing operations in japan recorded in the third quarter restructuring charge 
during  the company expended million against the related restructuring reserves  primarily for the payment of severance benefits  which were mostly attributable to the restructuring actions

for  the company expects to generate million to million in cash flow after dividends  excluding the impacts on cash from the purchase and sale of marketable securities  the impacts from debt and transactions in the company s own equity  such as stock repurchases and the proceeds from the exercise of stock options 
the company believes that its cash flow from operations will be sufficient to cover its working capital needs and the funds required for dividend payments  debt reduction  acquisitions and the potential repurchase of shares of the company s common stock 
the company s cash balances and financing arrangements will be used to bridge timing differences between expenditures and cash generated from operations 
on july   the company completed the renegotiation of its day committed revolving credit facility day facility 
the new  million facility is million lower than the facility due to a reduction in the company s commercial paper usage and the establishment of the accounts receivable securitization program 
as a result  the company now has  million in committed revolving credit facilities  which are available to support the company s commercial paper program and for general corporate purposes 
the credit facilities are comprised of the new day facility at  million expiring in july and a year committed facility at  million expiring in july year facility 
if unused  they have a commitment fee of million per year  at the company s current credit rating of bbb standard poor s s p and baa moody s 
interest on amounts borrowed under these facilities is calculated at rates based on spreads above certain reference rates and the company s credit rating 
due to the credit rating downgrades mentioned below and the generally tight bank credit market  the borrowing costs under the new day facility have increased by approximately basis points on an undrawn basis and basis points on a fully drawn basis at the company s current credit ratings 
the borrowing costs under the year facility have increased by basis points on an undrawn basis and basis points on a fully drawn basis 
these costs will increase or decrease based on future changes in the company s credit rating 
in connection with the renegotiation of the  million facility  the covenant under both of the facilities  which previously required the company to maintain a certain ebitda earnings before interest  income taxes  depreciation and amortization to interest ratio  was changed to a debt to ebitda ratio 
in the event of violation of the covenant  the facility would not be available for borrowing until the covenant provisions were waived  amended or satisfied 
the company was in compliance with this covenant at december  the company does not anticipate that a violation is likely to occur 
the company has other committed and uncommitted lines of credit at december  totaling million and  million  respectively 
these lines primarily support borrowing needs of the company s subsidiaries  which include term loans  overdraft coverage  letters of credit and revolving credit lines 
interest rates and other terms of borrowing under these lines of credit vary from country to country  depending on local market conditions 
total outstanding borrowings against these other committed and uncommitted lines of credit at december  were million and million  respectively 
these outstanding borrowings are reflected in the short term bank borrowings and long term debt balances at december  at december   the company had million in commercial paper outstanding  with a weighted average interest rate of 
to provide additional financing flexibility  the company entered into an accounts receivable securitization program  which provides for borrowings up to a maximum of million 
at december   the company had outstanding borrowings under this program of million 
based on the outstanding secured borrowings level of million  the estimated annualized interest rate under this program is 
during the second quarter of  the company increased its medium term note program from  million to  million for issuance of debt securities due nine months or more from date of issue 
at december   the company had debt securities outstanding of million under this medium term note program  with none of this balance due within one year 
the company has remaining availability of  million under its medium term note program for the issuance of new notes 
long term debt and related maturities and interest rates were as follows at december  and in millions weighted average interest country type maturity rate us term note us term note us term note us medium term us medium term us term note us term note us term note china bank loans china bank loans china bank loans china bank loans china bank loans japan bank loans qualex term notes chile bank loans other during the quarter ended march   the company s credit ratings for long term debt were lowered by moody s and by fitch to baa and a  respectively 
however  in connection with its downgrade  moody s changed the company s outlook from negative to stable 
additionally  fitch lowered the company s credit rating on short term debt to f on april   s p lowered the company s credit rating on long term debt to bbb  a level equivalent to the company s current rating from moody s of baa s p reaffirmed the short term debt at a and maintained the company s outlook at stable 
these credit rating downgrade actions were due to lower earnings as a result of the continued weakened economy  industry factors and other world events 
the reductions in the company s long term debt credit ratings have impacted the credit spread applied to kodak s us long term debt traded in the secondary markets 
however  this has not resulted in an increase in interest expense  as the company has not issued any significant new long term debt during this period 
the reduction in the company s short term debt credit ratings has impacted the cost of short term borrowings  primarily the cost of issuing commercial paper 
however  this increased cost was more than offset by the lowering of market rates of interest as a result of actions taken by the federal reserve to stimulate the us economy 
as indicated above  the company s weighted average commercial paper rate for commercial paper outstanding at december  was as compared with at december  the credit rating downgrades in the first half of coupled with the downgrades in the fourth quarter of would have resulted in an increase in borrowing rates  however  due to lower average debt levels and lower commercial paper rates  interest expense for the year ended december  is down relative to the year ended december  the above credit rating actions are not expected to have a material impact on the future operations of the company 
however  if the company s credit ratings were to be reduced further  this could potentially affect access to commercial paper borrowing 
while this is not expected to occur  if such an event did take place the company could use alternative sources of borrowing including its accounts receivable securitization program  long term capital markets debt  and its revolving credit facilities 
the company is in compliance with all covenants or other requirements set forth in its credit agreements and indentures 
further  the company does not have any rating downgrade triggers that would accelerate the maturity dates of its debt  with the exception of the following a million note due april  and million in term notes that will amortize through that can be accelerated if the company s credit rating from s p or moody s were to fall below bbb and bbb  respectively  and the outstanding borrowings under the accounts receivable securitization program if the company s credit ratings from s p or moody s were to fall below bbb and baa  respectively  and such condition continued for a period of days 
further downgrades in the company s credit rating or disruptions in the capital markets could impact borrowing costs and the nature of its funding alternatives 
however  the company has access to  million in committed bank revolving credit facilities to meet unanticipated funding needs should it be necessary 
borrowing rates under these credit facilities are based on the company s credit rating 
the company guarantees debt and other obligations under agreements with certain affiliated companies and customers 
at december   these guarantees totaled a maximum of million  with outstanding guaranteed amounts of million 
the maximum guarantee amount includes guarantees of up to million of debt for kpg million outstanding and up to million for other unconsolidated affiliates and third parties million outstanding and guarantees of up to million of customer amounts due to banks in connection with various banks financing of customers purchase of products and equipment from kodak million outstanding 
the kpg debt facility and the related guarantee mature on december   but may be renewed at kpg s  kodak s and the bank s discretion 
the guarantees for the other third party debt mature between may  and may  and are not expected to be renewed 
the customer financing agreements and related guarantees typically have a term of days for product and short term equipment financing arrangements  and up to years for long term equipment financing arrangements 
these guarantees would require payment from kodak only in the event of default on payment by the respective debtor 
in some cases  particularly for guarantees related to equipment financing  the company has collateral or recourse provisions to recover and sell the equipment to reduce any losses that might be incurred in connection with the guarantee 
this activity is not material 
management believes the likelihood is remote that material payments will be required under these guarantees 
the company also guarantees debt owed to banks for some of its consolidated subsidiaries 
the maximum amount guaranteed is million  and the outstanding debt under those guarantees  which is recorded within the short term borrowings and long term debt  net of current portion components in the consolidated statement of financial position  is million

the maximum potential future payments that the company could be required to make under these indemnifications are either contractually limited to a specified amount or unlimited 
the company believes that the maximum potential future payments that the company could be required to make under these indemnifications are not determinable at this time  as any future payments would be dependent on the type and extent of the related claims  and all available defenses  which are not estimable 
however  costs incurred to settle claims related to these indemnifications have not been material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows

the company believes that the maximum potential future payments that the company could be required to make under these indemnifications are not determinable at this time  as any future payments would be dependent on the type and extent of the related claims  and all relevant defenses to the claims  including statutes of limitation  which are not estimable 
however  costs incurred to settle claims related to these indemnifications have not been material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the company has by laws  policies  and agreements under which it indemnifies its directors and officers from liability for certain events or occurrences while the directors or officers are  or were  serving at kodak s request in such capacities 
furthermore  the company is incorporated in the state of new jersey  which requires corporations to indemnify their officers and directors under certain circumstances 
the company has made similar arrangements with respect to the directors and officers of acquired companies

the company had a commitment under a put option arrangement with burrell colour lab bcl  an unaffiliated company  whereby the shareholders of bcl had the ability to put of the stock to kodak for total consideration  including the assumption of debt  of approximately million 
the option first became exercisable on october  and was ultimately exercised during the company s fourth quarter ended december  accordingly  on february   the company acquired bcl for a total purchase price of approximately million  which was composed of approximately million in cash and million in assumed debt 
the exercise of the option had no impact on the company s fourth quarter earnings 
in connection with the company s investment in china that began in  certain unaffiliated entities invested in two kodak consolidated companies with the opportunity to put their minority interests to kodak at any time after the third anniversary  but prior to the tenth anniversary  of the date on which the companies were established 
on december   an unaffiliated investor in one of kodak s china subsidiaries exercised their rights under the put option agreement 
under the terms of the arrangement  the company repurchased the investor s minority interest for approximately million in cash 
the exercise of this put option and the recording of the related minority interest purchased had no impact on the company s earnings 
the total exercise price in connection with the remaining put options  which increases at a rate of per annum  is approximately million at december  the company expects that approximately million of the remaining million in total put options will be exercised and the related cash payments will occur over the next twelve months 
due to continuing declines in the equity markets in as well as the decline in the discount rate from december  to december   the company was required to record a charge to the accumulated other comprehensive loss income component of equity of million  net of tax benefits of million  for additional minimum pension liabilities at december  the increase in additional minimum pension liabilities of million was recorded to the postretirement liabilities component on the consolidated statement of financial position at december  the increase in this component of million from december  to december  is primarily attributable to this increase in the additional minimum pension liabilities 
the company recorded the deferred income tax benefit of million in the other long term assets component within the consolidated statement of financial position 
the net increase in this component of million from december  to december  is partially attributable to the recording of these deferred income tax assets and the increase in the prepaid pension asset 
the increase in the prepaid pension asset is primarily attributable to million of pension income generated from the us pension plans in during the fourth quarter of  the company funded one of its non us defined benefit plans in the amount of approximately million 
the company does not expect to have significant funding requirements relating to its defined benefit pension plans in qualex  a wholly owned subsidiary of kodak  has a ownership interest in express stop financing esf  which is a joint venture partnership between qualex and dana credit corporation dcc  a wholly owned subsidiary of dana corporation 
qualex accounts for its investment in esf under the equity method of accounting 
esf provides a long term financing solution to qualex s photofinishing customers in connection with qualex s leasing of photofinishing equipment to third parties  as opposed to qualex extending long term credit 
as part of the operations of its photofinishing business  qualex sells equipment under a sales type lease arrangement and records a long term receivable 
these long term receivables are subsequently sold to esf without recourse to qualex 
esf incurs long term debt to finance the purchase of the receivables from qualex 
this debt is collateralized solely by the long term receivables purchased from qualex and  in part  by a million guarantee from dcc 
qualex provides no guarantee or collateral to esf s creditors in connection with the debt  and esf s debt is non recourse to qualex 
qualex s only continued involvement in connection with the sale of the long term receivables is the servicing of the related equipment under the leases 
qualex has continued revenue streams in connection with this equipment through future sales of photofinishing consumables  including paper and chemicals  and maintenance 
qualex has risk with respect to the esf arrangement as it relates to its continued ability to procure spare parts from the primary photofinishing equipment vendor the vendor to fulfill its servicing obligations under the leases 
this risk is attributable to the fact that  throughout  the vendor was experiencing financial difficulty which ultimately resulted in certain of its entities in different countries filing for bankruptcy on december  although the lessees requirement to pay esf under the lease agreements is not contingent upon qualex s fulfillment of its servicing obligations  under the agreement with esf  qualex would be responsible for any deficiency in the amount of rent not paid to esf as a result of any lessee s claim regarding maintenance or supply services not provided by qualex 
such lease payments would be made in accordance with the original lease terms  which generally extend over to years 
esf s outstanding lease receivable amount was approximately million at december  to mitigate the risk of not being able to fulfill its service obligations in the event the vendor were to file for bankruptcy  qualex built up its inventory of these spare parts during and began refurbishing used parts 
to further mitigate its exposure  effective april   kodak entered into certain agreements with the vendor under which the company paid million for a license relating to the spare parts intellectual property  an equity interest in the vendor and the intellectual property holding company and an arrangement to purchase spare parts 
after entering into these arrangements  the company obtained the documentation and specifications of the parts it sourced solely from the vendor and a comprehensive supplier list for the parts the vendor sourced from other suppliers 
however  under these arrangements  kodak had a use restriction  which precluded the company from manufacturing the parts that the vendor produced and from purchasing parts directly from the vendor s suppliers 
this use restriction would be effective until certain triggering events occurred  the most significant of which was the filing for bankruptcy by the vendor 
as indicated above  the vendor filed for bankruptcy on december  the arrangements that the company entered into with the vendor are currently being reviewed in the bankruptcy courts  and there is the possibility that such agreements could be challenged 
however  the company believes that it has a strong legal position with respect to the agreements and is taking the necessary steps to obtain the rights to gain access to the vendor s tooling to facilitate the manufacture of the parts previously produced by the vendor 
additionally  the company has begun to source parts directly from the vendor s suppliers 
accordingly  the company does not anticipate any significant liability arising from the inability to fulfill its service obligations under the arrangement with esf 
in december  s p downgraded the credit ratings of dana corporation to bb for long term debt and b for short term debt  which are below investment grade 
this action created a guarantor termination event under the receivables purchase agreement rpa between esf and its banks 
to cure the guarantor termination event  in january  esf posted million of additional collateral in the form of cash and long term lease receivables 
at that time  if dana corporation were downgraded to below bb by s p or below ba by moody s  that action would constitute a termination event under the rpa and esf would be forced to renegotiate its debt arrangements with the banks 
on february   moody s downgraded dana corporation to a ba credit rating  thus creating a termination event 
effective april   esf cured the termination event by executing an amendment to the rpa 
under the amended rpa  the maximum borrowings have been lowered to million  and esf must pay a higher interest rate on outstanding and future borrowings 
additionally  if there were certain changes in control with respect to dana corporation or dcc  as defined in the amended rpa  such an occurrence would constitute an event of default 
absent a waiver from the banks  this event of default would create a termination event under the amended rpa 
the amended rpa arrangement was further amended in july to extend through july under the amended rpa arrangement  maximum borrowings were reduced to million 
total outstanding borrowings under the rpa at december  were million 
dana corporation s s p and moody s long term debt credit ratings have remained at the february  levels of bb and ba  respectively 
under the amended rpa  if either of dana corporation s long term debt ratings were to fall below their current respective ratings  such an occurrence would create a termination event as defined in the rpa 
the amended rpa arrangement extends through july  at which time the rpa can be extended or terminated 
if the rpa were terminated  qualex would no longer be able to sell its lease receivables to esf and would need to find an alternative financing solution for future sales of its photofinishing equipment 
for the year ended december   total sales of photofinishing equipment were million 
under the partnership agreement between qualex and dcc  subject to certain conditions  esf has exclusivity rights to purchase qualex s long term lease receivables

this action resulted in the company making five dividend payments in net working capital  excluding short term borrowings  decreased to million from  million at year end this decrease is mainly attributable to lower receivable and inventory balances  as discussed above 
capital additions  excluding equipment purchased for lease  were million in  with the majority of the spending supporting new products  manufacturing productivity and quality improvements  infrastructure improvements  ongoing environmental and safety initiatives  and renovations due to relocations associated with restructuring actions taken in under the  million stock repurchase program announced on april   the company repurchased million of its shares in as of march   the company suspended the stock repurchase program in a move designed to accelerate debt reduction and increase financial flexibility 
at the time of the suspension of the program  the company had repurchased approximately  million of its shares under this program

the severance related actions associated with this charge will be completed by the end of the first quarter of net cash provided by operating activities in was  million  as net earnings of  million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization  provided  million of operating cash 
this was partially offset by increases in receivables of million  largely due to the timing of sales late in the fourth quarter  increases in inventories of million  reflecting lower than expected sales performance in the second half of the year  particularly for consumer films  paper and digital cameras  and decreases in liabilities  excluding borrowings  of million related primarily to severance payments for restructuring programs and reductions in accounts payable and accrued benefit costs

the company s cost estimates were determined using the astm standard e standard guide for estimating monetary costs and liabilities for environmental matters  and have not been reduced by possible recoveries from third parties 
the overall method includes the use of a probabilistic model which forecasts a range of cost estimates for the remediation required at individual sites 
the projects are closely monitored and the models are reviewed as significant events occur or at least once per year 
the company s estimate includes equipment and operating costs for remediation and long term monitoring of the sites 
the company does not believe it is reasonably possible that the losses for the known exposures could exceed the current accruals by material amounts

these expenditures are primarily capital in nature and  therefore  are not included in the environmental accrual at december the company is presently designated as a prp under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of  as amended the superfund law  or under similar state laws  for environmental assessment and cleanup costs as the result of the company s alleged arrangements for disposal of hazardous substances at six such active sites 
with respect to each of these sites  the company s liability is minimal 
furthermore  numerous other prps have also been designated at these sites and  although the law imposes joint and several liability on prps  the company s historical experience demonstrates that these costs are shared with other prps 
settlements and costs paid by the company in superfund matters to date have not been material 
future costs are also not expected to be material to the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
the clean air act amendments were enacted in expenditures to comply with the clean air act implementing regulations issued to date have not been material and have been primarily capital in nature 
in addition  future expenditures for existing regulations  which are primarily capital in nature  are not expected to be material 
many of the regulations to be promulgated pursuant to this act have not been issued 
uncertainties associated with environmental remediation contingencies are pervasive and often result in wide ranges of outcomes 
estimates developed in the early stages of remediation can vary significantly 
a finite estimate of cost does not normally become fixed and determinable at a specific time 
rather  the costs associated with environmental remediation become estimable over a continuum of events and activities that help to frame and define a liability  and the company continually updates its cost estimates 
the company has an ongoing monitoring and identification process to assess how the activities  with respect to the known exposures  are progressing against the accrued cost estimates  as well as to identify other potential remediation sites that are presently unknown 
estimates of the amount and timing of future costs of environmental remediation requirements are necessarily imprecise because of the continuing evolution of environmental laws and regulatory requirements  the availability and application of technology  the identification of presently unknown remediation sites and the allocation of costs among the potentially responsible parties 
based upon information presently available  such future costs are not expected to have a material effect on the company s competitive or financial position 
however  such costs could be material to results of operations in a particular future quarter or year

risk factors the following cautionary statements address a number of important factors that could cause the actual future results of the company to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements contained in this document 
additionally  because of the following factors  as well as other variables affecting our operating results  the company s past financial performance should not be considered an indicator of future performance and investors should not use historical trends to anticipate results or trends in future periods 
unanticipated delays in implementing certain product strategies including category expansion  digitization  oled displays and digital products would affect kodak s revenues 
the process for each product strategy is complex 
kodak s ability to successfully transition products and deploy new products requires that kodak make accurate predictions of the product development schedule as well as volumes  product mix  and customer demand 
the company may anticipate demand and perceived market acceptance that differs from the products realizable customer demand and revenue stream 
in addition  if the pricing element of each strategy is not sufficiently competitive with those of current and future competing products  kodak may lose market share  adversely affecting the company s revenues and prospects 
kodak s ability to implement its intellectual property licensing strategies could also affect the company s revenue and earnings 
kodak has invested millions of dollars in technologies and needs to protect its intellectual property 
the establishment and enforcement of licensing agreements provides a revenue stream in the form of royalties that protects kodak s ability to further innovate and help the marketplace grow 
kodak s failure to properly manage the development of its intellectual property could adversely affect the future of these patents and the market opportunities that could result from the use of this property 
kodak s failure to manage the costs associated with the pursuit of these licenses could adversely affect the profitability of these operations 
in the event kodak were unable to develop and implement e commerce strategies that are in alignment with the trend toward industry standards and services  the company s business could be adversely affected 
the availability of software and standards related to e commerce strategies is of an emerging nature 
kodak s ability to successfully align with the industry standards and services and ensure timely solutions  requires the company to make accurate predictions of the future accepted standards and services 
kodak s completion of planned information systems upgrades  including sap  if delayed  could adversely affect its business 
as kodak continues to expand the planned information services  the company must continue to balance the investment of the planned deployment with the need to upgrade the vendor software 
kodak s failure to successfully upgrade to the vendor supported version could result in risks to system availability  which could adversely affect the business 
kodak intends to complete various portfolio actions required to strengthen its digital imaging portfolio  rationalize the photofinishing operations in the us and eamer and expand its services business 
in the event that kodak fails to effectively manage the highly profitable portfolio of its more traditional businesses simultaneously with the integration of these acquisitions  and should kodak fail to streamline and simplify the business  kodak could lose market opportunities that result in an adverse impact on its revenue 
in  kodak continues to focus on reduction of inventories  improvement in receivable performance  reduction in capital expenditures  and improvement in manufacturing productivity 
unanticipated delays in the company s plans to continue inventory reductions in could adversely impact kodak s cash flow outlook 
planned inventory reductions could be compromised by slower sales that could result from continued weak global economic conditions 
purchasers uncertainty about the extent of the global economic downturn could result in lower demand for products and services 
the competitive environment and the transition to digital products and services could also place pressures on kodak s sales and market share 
in the event kodak was unable to successfully manage these issues in a timely manner  they could adversely impact the planned inventory reductions 
delays in kodak s planned improvement in manufacturing productivity could negatively impact the gross margins of the company 
again  a continued weak economy could result in lower volumes in the factory than planned  which would negatively impact gross margins 
kodak s failure to successfully manage operational performance factors could delay or curtail planned improvements in manufacturing productivity 
if kodak is unable to successfully negotiate raw material costs with its suppliers  or incurs adverse pricing on certain of its commodity based raw materials  reduction in the gross margins could occur 
additionally  delays in the company s execution of increasing manufacturing capabilities for certain of its products in some of its emerging markets  particularly china where it is more cost competitive  could adversely impact margins 
unanticipated delays in the company s plans to continue the improvement of accounts receivable and to reduce the number of days sales outstanding could also adversely impact kodak s cash outlook 
a continued weak economy could slow customer payment patterns 
competitive pressures in major segments may drive erosion in the financial condition of kodak s customers 
these same pressures may adversely affect efforts to shorten customer payment terms 
kodak s ability to manage customer risk while maintaining competitive share may adversely affect continued accounts receivable improvement in in addition  if kodak is not able to maintain flat capital spending relative to levels  this factor could adversely impact the company s cash flow outlook 
an increase in capital spending may occur if more projects than planned were found to generate significant positive returns in the future 
further  if the company deems it necessary to spend more on regulatory requirements or there are unanticipated general maintenance obligations requiring more capital spending than planned  the additional monies required would create an adverse impact on kodak s cash flow 
kodak s planned improvement in supply chain efficiency  if delayed  could adversely affect its business by impacting the shipments of certain products in their desired quantities and in a timely manner 
the planned efficiencies could be compromised if kodak expands into new markets with new applications that are not fully understood or if the portfolio broadens beyond that anticipated when the plans were initiated 
the unforeseen changes in manufacturing capacity could compromise the supply chain efficiencies 
the risk of doing business in developing markets like china  india  brazil  argentina  mexico  russia and other economically volatile areas could adversely affect kodak s operations and earnings 
such risks include the financial instability among customers in these regions  the political instability and potential conflicts among developing nations and other non economic factors such as irregular trade flows that need to be managed successfully with the help of the local governments 
kodak s failure to successfully manage economic  political and other risks relating to doing business in developing countries and economically and politically volatile areas could adversely affect its business 
in early  the united states dollar was eliminated as argentina s monetary benchmark  resulting in significant currency devaluation 
during the remainder of  the currencies in both argentina and brazil experienced significant devaluation due to continuing difficult economic times 
there can be no guarantee that economic circumstances in argentina or elsewhere will not worsen  which could result in future effects on earnings should such events occur 
the company s failure to successfully manage economic  political and other risks relating to doing business in developing countries could adversely affect its business 
the company  as a result of its global operating and financing activities  is exposed to changes in currency exchange rates and interest rates  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
competition remains intense in the imaging sector in the photography  commercial and health segments 
on the photography side  price competition has been driven somewhat by consumers conservative spending behaviors during times of a weak world economy  international tensions and the accompanying concern over the possibility of war and terrorism 
some consumers have moved from branded products to private label products 
on the health and commercial side  aggressive pricing tactics intensified in the contract negotiations as competitors were vying for customers and market share domestically 
continued economic weakness could also adversely impact kodak s revenues and growth rate 
failure to successfully manage the consumers return to branded products if and when the economic conditions improve could adversely impact kodak s revenue and growth rate 
if the pricing and programs are not sufficiently competitive with those offered by kodak s current and future competitors  kodak may lose market share  adversely affecting its revenue and gross margins 
the company s strategy to balance the consumer shift from analog to digital  and the nature and pace of technology substitution could impact kodak s revenues  earnings and growth rate 
competition remains intense in the digital industry with a large number of competitors vying for customers and market share domestically and internationally 
kodak intends to continue new program introductions and competitive pricing to drive demands in the marketplace 
the process of developing new products and services is complex and often uncertain due to the frequent introduction of new products that offer improved performance and pricing 
kodak s ability to successfully transition products and deploy new products requires that kodak make accurate predictions of the product development schedule as well as volumes  product mix  customer demand and configuration 
kodak may anticipate demand and perceived market acceptance that differs from the product s realizable customer demand and revenue stream 
further  in the face of intense industry competition  any delay in the development  production or marketing of a new product could decrease any advantage kodak may have to be the first or among the first to market 
kodak s failure to carry out a product rollout in the time frame anticipated and in the quantities appropriate to customer demand could adversely affect the future demand for its products and services and have an adverse effect on its business 
the impact of continuing customer consolidation and buying power could have an adverse impact on kodak s revenue  gross margins  and earnings 
in the competitive consumer retail environment there is a movement from small individually owned retailers to larger and commonly known mass merchants 
in the commercial environment  there is a continuing consolidation of various group purchasing organizations 
the resellers and distributors may elect to use suppliers other than kodak 
kodak s challenge is to successfully negotiate contracts that provide the most favorable conditions to the company in the face of price and program aggressive competitors 
continued weak global economic conditions could adversely impact the company s revenues and growth rate 
continued softness in the company s markets and purchasers uncertainty about the extent of the global economic downturn could result in lower demand for products and services 
while worsening economic conditions have had a negative impact on results of operations  revenues  gross margins and earnings could further deteriorate as a result of economic conditions 
furthermore  there can be no assurances as to the timing of an economic upturn 
the company expects to be another difficult economic year compounded by rising political tensions  with a slight improvement in full year revenues 
the company expects earnings to be flat for the first quarter of compared with the same period last year 
we do not expect to see any real upturn in the economy until  with a very gradual return to consumer spending habits and behavior that will positively affect our business growth 
the company will continue to take actions to minimize the financial impact of this slowdown 
these actions include efforts to better manage production and inventory levels and reduce capital spending  while at the same time reducing discretionary spending to further hold down costs 
the company will also complete the implementation of the restructuring programs announced in  as well as implement new focused cost reduction actions in  to make its operations more cost competitive and improve margins

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company  as a result of its global operating and financing activities  is exposed to changes in foreign currency exchange rates  commodity prices  and interest rates  which may adversely affect its results of operations and financial position 
in seeking to minimize the risks and or costs associated with such activities  the company may enter into derivative contracts 
foreign currency forward contracts are used to hedge existing foreign currency denominated assets and liabilities  especially those of the company s international treasury center  as well as forecasted foreign currency denominated intercompany sales 
silver forward contracts are used to mitigate the company s risk to fluctuating silver prices 
the company s exposure to changes in interest rates results from its investing and borrowing activities used to meet its liquidity needs 
long term debt is generally used to finance long term investments  while short term debt is used to meet working capital requirements 
an interest rate swap agreement was used to convert some floating rate debt to fixed rate debt 
the company does not utilize financial instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
using a sensitivity analysis based on estimated fair value of open forward contracts using available forward rates  if the us dollar had been weaker at december  and  the fair value of open forward contracts would have increased million  and decreased million  respectively 
such gains or losses would be substantially offset by losses or gains from the revaluation or settlement of the underlying positions hedged 
using a sensitivity analysis based on estimated fair value of open forward contracts using available forward prices  if available forward silver prices had been lower at december  and  the fair value of open forward contracts would have decreased million and million  respectively 
such losses in fair value  if realized  would be offset by lower costs of manufacturing silver containing products 
the company is exposed to interest rate risk primarily through its borrowing activities and  to a lesser extent  through investments in marketable securities 
the company utilizes us dollar denominated and foreign currency denominated borrowings to fund its working capital and investment needs 
the majority of short term and long term borrowings are in fixed rate instruments 
there is inherent roll over risk for borrowings and marketable securities as they mature and are renewed at current market rates 
the extent of this risk is not predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements 
using a sensitivity analysis based on estimated fair value of short term and long term borrowings  if available market interest rates had been about basis points higher at december   the fair value of short term and long term borrowings would have decreased million and million  respectively
