overview we develop  market and sell the e 
piphany e 
suite of software products  a set of customer relationship management  or crm  software products 
these crm products provide capabilities for the collection and analysis of customer data  the creation of inbound and outbound marketing campaigns  and the execution of sales and service customer interactions 
companies can implement the e 
suite to gain insight into their customers characteristics and preferences  and then take action on that insight to better and more profitably serve those customers 
to gain insight into their customers  companies use our analytic crm products  which collect customer data from existing software systems or other e 
piphany solutions  as well as third party data providers 
to take action on this insight  companies use our operational crm products to more effectively interact with their customers across a variety of communication and distribution channels 
we were founded in november and were primarily engaged in research and development activities until early when we shipped our first software product and generated our first revenues from software license  consulting  and maintenance fees 
in september and january we raised a total of approximately million through the sale of our common stock in registered public offerings to fund growth and to acquire complementary businesses and technologies 
during and  we completed several acquisitions in exchange for our stock consideration including the acquisition of rightpoint software  inc  octane software  inc  eclass direct  inc 
and moss software  inc 
these acquisitions increased our customer base  increased the number of our employees and expanded our product suite 
as a result of these acquisitions  we recorded goodwill and purchased intangible assets of approximately billion representing the difference between the value of the consideration paid in our stock and the value of the assets and liabilities acquired 
from the shipment of our first software product in early through the fourth quarter of  our revenues increased steadily each quarter due primarily to the market acceptance and success of our products such as e 
piphany insight and e 
piphany marketing  as well as the shipment of new products such as e 
piphany service which were introduced through a combination of acquisitions and internal development 
our annual revenues grew to million in from million in and million in our net losses  however  increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   primarily due to non cash charges of million for the amortization of goodwill and intangibles and the write off of in process research and development related to our acquisitions 
to a lesser extent  the net loss for increased due to the expansion of our sales and marketing activities and increased investment in product development 
during  the worldwide economy weakened and a slowdown in technology spending by businesses occurred 
as a result  our revenues declined each quarter during  although annual revenues declined only slightly from million in to million in during this economic slowdown  we initiated a plan in the third quarter of to restructure our worldwide operations by reducing our workforce and consolidating our operating facilities 
we also reviewed the impact of the change in market conditions on the carrying value of our goodwill and intangible assets 
we determined that these assets were impaired and wrote down their fair value by recording a non cash charge of billion in september net loss for the year ended december  increased to billion from million for the year ended december   primarily as a result of the billion non cash impairment and an increase in non cash amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles to million 
to a lesser extent  our net loss increased due to the restructuring charges of million recorded in as well as increased investment in research and development and the growth in our sales and marketing costs which occurred prior to the initiation of our restructuring plan 
economic and technology spending weakness continued into and our revenues continued to decline through the first half of  but increased during the second half of during early  we completed restructuring activities that began in the third quarter of and recorded related charges totaling million 
the net loss decreased to million in from billion in  primarily due to a reduction of approximately billion in non cash amortization and impairment charges related to goodwill and purchased intangibles  and to a lesser extent  lower restructuring charges  a reduction of our workforce and lower facilities costs 
as of december   we have approximately customers  employees  and million in cash and investments  including million of restricted cash 
sources of revenue we generate revenues principally from licensing our software products directly to customers and providing related services including implementation  consulting  maintenance and training services 
through december   substantially all of our revenues were generated by our direct sales force 
our license agreements generally provide that customers pay a software license fee to perpetually use one or more software products within specified limits 
the amount of the license fee varies depending on which software products are purchased  the number of software products purchased and the scope of usage rights 
customers can subsequently pay additional license fees to expand the right to use previously licensed software products  or to purchase additional software products 
our software products are made available either on compact disc or electronically 
customers generally require consulting and implementation services  which include evaluating their business needs  identifying the data sources necessary to meet these needs and installing the software solution in a manner that fulfills their requirements 
customers can purchase these services directly from third party consulting organizations  such as accenture  bearingpoint formerly kpmg consulting  deloitte consulting or ibm 
alternatively  customers can purchase these services directly from us through our internal professional services organization 
consulting and implementation services can be acquired on either a fixed fee or a time and expense basis 
we have also historically supplemented the capacity of our internal professional services organization by subcontracting some of these services to third party consulting organizations 
cost of revenues and operating expenses our cost of product license revenues primarily consists of license fees payable to third parties for technology integrated into our products 
our cost of services revenues primarily consists of salaries and related expenses for our professional services  maintenance and training organizations  an allocation of facilities  information technology and depreciation expenses  cost of reimbursable expenses and costs of subcontracting to consulting organizations to provide consulting services to customers 
cost of revenues also includes the amortization of purchased technology arising from our acquisitions 
our operating expenses are classified into three general categories sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative 
we classify all charges to these operating expense categories based on the nature of the expenditures 
we allocate the costs for overhead and facilities to each of the functional areas that use the overhead and facilities services based on headcount 
these allocated charges include facilities  information technology  communications and depreciation expenses 
software development costs incurred prior to the establishment of technological feasibility are included in research and development costs as they are incurred 
since license revenues from our software solutions are not recognized until after technological feasibility has been established  software development costs are not generally expensed in the same period in which license revenues for the developed products are recognized 
critical accounting policies and estimates accounting policies  methods and estimates are an integral part of the consolidated financial statements prepared by management and are based upon management s current judgments 
those judgments are normally based on knowledge and experience with regard to past and current events and assumptions about future events 
certain accounting policies  methods and estimates are particularly sensitive because of their significance to the financial statements and because of the possibility that future events affecting them may differ markedly from management s current judgments 
while there are a number of accounting policies  methods and estimates affecting our financial statements  areas that are particularly significant and subject to the exercise of judgment include revenue recognition policies  allowances for doubtful accounts  the measurement and recoverability of goodwill and purchased intangible assets  and restructuring accruals for the abandonment of certain leased facilities 
these policies and our practices related to these policies are described below and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is significant because it determines if  and when  we can record revenue from the sale of software licenses and related services 
we follow detailed guidelines discussed below and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we recognize revenue in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  which have been prescribed for the software industry 
the accounting rules related to revenue recognition are complex and are affected by interpretations of the rules and an understanding of industry practices  both of which are subject to change 
consequently  the revenue recognition accounting rules require management to make significant judgments 
we do not record revenue on sales transactions when collectibility is in doubt at the time of sale 
rather  revenue is recognized from these transactions as cash is collected 
the determination of collectibility requires significant judgment 
to date  when we have been primarily responsible for the implementation of the software on an arrangement  both product license revenues and service revenues are recognized under the percentage of completion contract method in accordance with the provisions of statement of position  accounting for performance of construction type and certain production type contracts sop 
this is based on our assessment that the implementation services for these arrangements are essential to the functionality of our software 
prior to the  e 
piphany was primarily responsible for the implementation services for the majority of its license arrangements 
from the first quarter of through the second quarter of  third party consulting organizations were primarily responsible for the implementation services for the majority of e 
piphany s license arrangements and as a result  the percentage of total license revenue recognized under sop has declined 
approximately  and of license revenue was recognized under sop during  and  respectively 
since the second quarter of  e 
piphany has increasingly been responsible for implementation services and therefore the company expects that the proportion of license revenue recognized under the percentage of completion method will increase in the first half of we estimate the percentage of completion on contracts utilizing hours incurred to date as a percentage of the total estimated hours to complete the project 
the percentage of completion method of accounting involves an estimation process and is subject to risks and uncertainties inherent in projecting future events 
a number of internal and external factors can affect our estimates  including the nature of the services being performed  the complexity of the customer s information technology environment and the utilization and efficiency of our professional services employees 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
allowances for doubtful accounts a considerable amount of judgment is required when we assess the realization of receivables  including assessing the probability of collection and the current credit worthiness of each customer 
when we believe a collectibility issue exists with respect to a specific receivable  we record an allowance to reduce that receivable to the amount that we believe is collectible 
for all other receivables  we record an allowance based on an assessment of the aging of such receivables  our historical experience with bad debts and the general economic environment 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required that would result in additional general and administrative expense in the period such determination is made 
acquisitions  goodwill and purchased intangible assets we record goodwill and purchased intangible assets when we acquire other companies 
the cost of the acquisition is allocated to the assets and liabilities acquired  including purchased intangible assets  and the remaining amount is classified as goodwill 
certain purchased intangible assets such as purchased technology and customer lists are amortized to cost of revenues and operating expense over time  while in process research and development is recorded as a one time charge on the acquisition date 
under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which became effective on july   goodwill arising from transactions occurring after july  and any existing goodwill as of january  are not amortized to expense  but rather periodically assessed for impairment 
the allocation of the acquisition cost to purchased intangible assets and goodwill  therefore  has a significant impact on our operating results 
the allocation process involves an extensive use of estimates and assumptions  including estimates of future cash flows to be generated by the acquired assets 
as a result of the adoption of sfas as of january   we ceased amortization of approximately million of goodwill 
in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform a transitional impairment test of goodwill 
further  we perform impairment tests annually or when impairment indicators are identified with respect to previously recorded intangible assets 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair market value 
fair market value is determined using  among other things  discounted future cash flow techniques 
estimating discounted future cash flows requires significant management judgment concerning revenue  profitability and discount rates 
differences between forecasted and actual results as well as changes in the general economic environment could result in material write downs of goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we performed the transitional impairment test on january  and the annual impairment test on december  and determined that no impairment existed 
restructuring costs as discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we have recorded significant restructuring costs in connection with our abandonment of certain leased facilities 
the lease abandonment costs were estimated to include remaining lease liabilities and brokerage fees offset by estimated sublease income 
estimates related to sublease costs and income are based on assumptions regarding the period required to sublease the facilities and the likely sublease rates 
these estimates are based on market trend information analyses provided by commercial real estate brokerage firms retained by us 
we review these estimates each reporting period and  to the extent that our assumptions change  adjustments to the restructuring accrual are recorded 
if the real estate market continues to worsen and we are not able to sublease the properties as early as  or at the rates estimated  the accrual will be increased  which would result in additional restructuring costs in the period in which such determination is made 
if the real estate market strengthens and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected  the accrual may be decreased  which would increase net income in the period in which such determination is made

eitf  income statement characterization of reimbursements received for out of pocket expenses incurred  services revenues and cost of services revenues have been reclassified for years prior to december  to reflect out of pocket expenses billed to customers as revenue rather than a reduction of the related expense 
see note of notes to the consolidated financial statements 
amortization of purchased technology has been reclassified from amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles in operating expenses to cost of revenues 
as a result  amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles have been reduced from previously reported amounts by   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
years ended december  and revenues revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease in revenues was primarily due to fewer sales of our product licenses resulting primarily from an economic slowdown and a significant decline in spending by companies on information technology 
for the year ended december   revenue from the united states declined by million  or  revenue from the united kingdom declined by million  or  and revenue from the rest of the world increased by million  or 
the increase in revenue from the rest of the world is a function of the relatively small revenues in and we do not expect these revenues to increase at the same rate in the future 
we expect to focus the majority of our direct sales and marketing activities in the united states and europe and  therefore  expect that a higher percentage of our revenue will be derived from these geographies in the future 
product license revenues decreased to million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  this decrease in product license revenues was primarily due to fewer sales resulting primarily from the downturn in the economy and weakness in information technology spending 
although sequentially down in as compared to  license revenues were sequentially flat from the second to the third quarter of and up to a small degree in the fourth quarter of we expect the economic slowdown to continue to adversely impact our ability to forecast license revenues for the next several quarters and perhaps longer 
services revenues consist of revenue from professional  maintenance and training services 
services revenues decreased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  the decrease in services revenue was driven primarily by a decrease in consulting services  offset in part by an increase in maintenance revenue attributable to maintenance contracts sold to our new customers 
the decrease in consulting services was primarily the result of less services rendered due to a decrease in product sales 
the relative amount of services revenues as compared to license revenues has varied depending on the extent to which third party consulting organizations have been engaged directly by customers to provide professional services  the nature of products licensed  the complexity of customers information technology environment  the resources allocated by customers to implementation projects and the scope of licensed rights 
services revenues have substantially lower margins than product license revenues 
this is especially true when we are required to subcontract with consulting organizations to supplement our internal professional services organization 
to the extent that services revenues become a greater percentage of our total revenues  our overall gross margins will decline 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues decreased to million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  cost of revenues include the cost of product license revenues  the cost of services revenues and the amortization of purchased technology 
cost of product license revenues consists primarily of license fees paid to third parties under technology license arrangements and  as a percentage of license revenues  has not been significant to date 
cost of services revenues consists primarily of personnel and related costs of providing professional  maintenance and training services 
cost of services revenues decreased to million  or of services revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of services revenues  for the year ended december  the decrease was the result of a reduction in the number of internal professional services employees and the related overhead and facilities costs as well as a reduction in the use of services subcontracted from third parties 
the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue is due to a higher proportion of maintenance revenue  which has more favorable margins than professional services and training revenue  as well as a reduction in the number of services employees from at december  to at december   which resulted in improved margins for consulting  maintenance and training revenues 
of the total reduction in the number of services employees during  related to the restructuring of our operations and the remainder related to voluntary and other terminations 
amortization of purchased technology decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  primarily due to a write down of the carrying value of the assets during the third quarter of see discussion of amortization and write down of goodwill and purchased intangibles below 
purchased technology assets of million are included in purchased intangibles on our consolidated balance sheet and are being amortized on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives 
amortization of purchased technology is expected to be million for the year ending december  and million for the year ending december  operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs associated with our product development efforts 
research and development expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due in part to the restructuring of our operations  which resulted in lower overhead and facilities costs 
the decrease was also due to a reduction in consulting fees associated with localizing our product for international markets and translating our product into various languages 
research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  we believe that investments in product development are essential to our future success and  therefore  the cost reductions we implemented did not reduce our research and development expenses as much as other expense items 
the number of research and development employees decreased from as of december  to as of december  of this total decrease  related to the restructuring of our operations and the remainder related to voluntary and other terminations 
we anticipate that research and development expenses will increase over the long term in absolute dollars 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of employee salaries  benefits and commissions  and the costs of trade shows  seminars  promotional materials and other sales and marketing programs 
sales and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of sales and marketing employees from at december  to as of december  of the total reduction  related to the restructuring of our operations and the remainder related to voluntary and other terminations 
the decrease was also due to lower overhead and facilities costs as a result of our restructuring plans and lower spending on other sales and marketing programs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of employee salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  legal and administrative personnel 
general and administrative expenses decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a reduction in the number of general and administrative employees from at december  to at december  of this reduction  related to the restructuring of our operations and the remainder related to voluntary and other terminations 
the decline was also due to lower overhead and facilities costs as a result of our restructuring plans and a decline in bad debt expense due to an increase in collection rates 
restructuring costs 
in the quarter ended september   the company began restructuring worldwide operations to reduce costs and improve efficiencies in response to a slower economic environment 
a detailed review was performed between the third quarter of and the second quarter of to improve the company s cost structure in light of market conditions 
under eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit and activity  actions were deemed to be the commencement of separate restructuring plans in the quarter in which those actions could be specifically identified 
the first plan was initiated in the quarter ended september  and was completed in the quarter ended march  plan 
the second plan was initiated and completed during the quarter ended june  plan 
charges were recorded to restructuring expense as the costs associated with each plan could be reasonably estimated 
these charges were based on assumptions and related estimates that were appropriate for the economic environment that existed at the time these charges were recorded 
however  due to the continued deterioration of the commercial real estate market  primarily in the us  and the final settlement of certain lease obligations  we have made subsequent adjustments to the initial restructuring charges recorded 
during  we recorded a charge of million  of which million reflects the initial restructuring charge for plan recorded in the third quarter of and million related to changes in estimated costs associated with plan during  we recorded a charge of million  of which million related to additional restructuring charges taken when the related liabilities could be reasonably estimated for plan  million was the initial restructuring charge for plan and million related to changes in estimated costs recorded during and at december   we had an accrued liability of million with respect to the restructuring plans 
in connection with our intention to further focus our direct sales and marketing activities in the united states and europe  the company expects to incur additional restructuring charges between million and million  predominantly related to the abandonment of facilities in certain international regions 
amortization and write down of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
our acquisitions of ileverage  octane  eclass direct and rightpoint in and the acquisitions of moss and certain intellectual property assets of radnet were accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets representing the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired 
the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to the cessation of the amortization of goodwill in accordance with sfas and to a billion charge for the impairment of goodwill and intangible assets recorded in the year ended december  in accordance with sfas  we performed impairment tests of purchased intangible assets and goodwill in connection with all of our acquisitions upon the adoption of sfas on january  and again on december  the impairment tests were performed with the assistance of a third party valuation firm and it was determined that no impairment existed 
we will continue to perform impairment tests of goodwill and purchased intangibles on an annual basis and when events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that the carrying value is not recoverable 
we have recorded significant impairment charges for goodwill and intangible assets in the past and to the extent that events or changes in circumstances cause our assumptions to change  additional charges  which could be material  may be required 
we will continue to amortize purchased intangible assets of million on a straight line basis over their remaining useful lives 
as discussed above  the amortization expense related to purchased technology assets of million as of december  will be recorded in cost of revenues 
the amortization expense related to other purchased intangible assets of million will be recorded in operating expense and will be fully amortized by june  see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation consists of amortization of deferred compensation in connection with stock option grants and sales of stock to employees at exercise or sales prices below the deemed fair market value of our common stock and compensation related to equity instruments issued to non employees for services rendered 
as of december   deferred compensation remaining to be amortized totaled million 
this amount is being amortized over the respective vesting periods of these equity instruments in a manner consistent with financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion regarding the accounting treatment for stock based compensation 
the company accounts for stock issued to employees in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
apb  accounting for stock issued to employees and complies with the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation and sfas no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
under apb  compensation expense for fixed stock options is based on the difference between the market value of the company s stock and the exercise price of the option on the date of grant  if any 
had we recognized stock based compensation expense under sfas  our stock based compensation expense would have been million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the accounting profession and regulatory agencies continue to consider whether companies will be required to record an expense for stock options granted with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the company s stock on the date of grant  as well as the methodology under which the amount of such expense will be determined 
we believe that the use of equity compensation is important to our ability to attract and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel 
other income  net other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a decrease in interest income primarily as a result of a decrease in the average rate of return on our investments and lower average cash and investment balances 
provision for income taxes from inception through december   we incurred net losses for federal and state tax purposes and have not recognized any tax provision or benefit 
due to uncertainties regarding realization of the assets based on the limited operating history of e 
piphany  the lack of profitability to date  and the uncertainty of future profitability we have a valuation allowance equal to the total deferred tax assets of million as of december  and therefore have no net deferred tax assets 
years ended december  and revenues total revenues decreased to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  total revenues increased for the first two quarters of as compared to the first two quarters of however  this increase was offset by a decrease in revenues for the last two quarters of as compared to the last two quarters of the decrease in revenues was primarily due to fewer sales of our product licenses resulting from an economic slowdown and the significant decline in spending by companies on information technology  particularly in the united states 
for the year ended december   domestic revenue declined by million or 
this decrease was offset in part by an increase in international revenues of million or 
this rapid growth in international revenues primarily reflected the early stage of development of our international operations 
product license revenues decreased to million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  from million  or of total revenue  for the year ended december  product license revenues increased for the first two quarters of as compared to the first two quarters of this increase was offset by a decrease for the last two quarters of as compared to the last two quarters of this decrease in product license revenues was primarily due to fewer sales of our product licenses resulting from a downturn in the economy and weakness in information technology spending  particularly in the united states 
although sequentially down from to  license revenues were sequentially flat for the last three quarters of services revenues increased to million  or of total revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of revenues  for the year ended december  services revenues increased for the first two quarters of as compared to the first two quarters of this increase was offset by a decrease for the last two quarters of as compared to the last two quarters of the decrease was due in part to the delivery of fewer services as a result of a decrease in product license sales and in part to the change in our strategy from fulfilling most of our customers consulting needs with our internal services professionals to encouraging our customers to contract directly with third party integrators 
this approach was adopted in conjunction with our overall strategy to strengthen our alliances with system integrators that recommend and implement our software on customers computer systems 
the decrease in consulting revenue was offset by an increase in maintenance revenue attributable to maintenance contracts sold to our new customers 
cost of revenues total cost of revenues was million for the year ended december  as compared to million for the year ended december  cost of services revenues decreased to million  or of services revenues  for the year ended december  from million  or of services revenues  for the year ended december  cost of services revenue increased for the first two quarters of as compared to the first two quarters of this increase was offset by a decrease in the cost of services revenue for the last two quarters of as compared to the last two quarters of the decrease was due to the reduction in the number of professional services employees from as of december  to as of december  which was primarily the result of our change in strategy from fulfilling all of our customers consulting needs with our internal services professionals to encouraging our customers to contract directly with third party integrators 
this approach was adopted in conjunction with our overall strategy to strengthen our alliances with system integrators that recommend and implement our software 
of the total decrease in professional services employees  related to the restructuring of our operations 
the decrease in cost of services as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to a higher proportion of maintenance revenue  which has more favorable margins 
amortization of purchased technology increased to million in the year ended december  from million in the year ended december  amortization expense increased due to an increase in purchased technology assets resulting primarily from the acquisitions of octane and eclass direct in the second quarter of and the acquisition of moss and of certain intellectual property of radnet in the first quarter of operating expenses research and development 
research and development expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  research and development expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in absolute dollars was primarily due to a higher number of research and development employees entering as compared to as a result of internal growth and acquisitions  and increased fees paid to outside contractors for the translation of our products 
this increase in absolute dollars was offset by a reduction in our overhead and facilities costs resulting from the restructuring of our operations that occurred in the third quarter of no research and development employees were reduced as a result of the restructuring of our operations during sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  sales and marketing expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of sales and marketing employees entering as compared to  resulting from internal growth and acquisitions 
in this regard  we established sales offices in additional domestic and international locations including ones in asia  australia  europe and latin america 
this increase in absolute dollars was offset by the restructuring of our operations that occurred in the third quarter of  which resulted in a reduction of sales and marketing employees and of overhead and facilities costs 
general and administrative 
general and administrative expenses increased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of total revenues increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the increase in general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of general and administrative employees entering as compared to  which were necessary to support our expanding operations 
this increase in absolute dollars was offset by the restructuring of our operations that occurred in the third quarter of  which resulted in a reduction of general and administrative employees and of overhead and facilities costs 
this increase was further offset by a reduction in bad debt expense relative to when worsening economic conditions had caused less predictable collections 
restructuring costs 
in the third quarter of  we initiated a plan to restructure our worldwide operations by reducing our workforce and consolidating our operating facilities and recorded a restructuring charge of million 
an additional charge of million was taken during the quarter ended december   which primarily reflected changes in the estimated costs of abandoning certain facilities associated with the plan initiated during the quarter ended september  in process research and development charge 
in connection with the acquisitions of rightpoint and octane  we recorded charges for in process research and development of million and million  respectively  in the year ended december  the value assigned to purchased in process technology was determined by estimating the costs to develop the purchased in process technology into commercially viable products  estimating the resulting net cash flows from the projects and discounting the net cash flows to their present value 
the revenue projection used to value the in process research and development was based on estimates of relevant market sizes and growth factors  expected trends in technology and the nature and expected timing of new product introductions by rightpoint  octane and their competitors 
at the acquisition dates  the development of these projects had not yet reached technological feasibility  and the research and development in progress had no alternative future uses 
accordingly  these costs were expensed as of the dates of acquisition 
there was no in process research and development charge incurred during the year ended december  please see note of notes to consolidated financial statements for more detailed information 
amortization and write down of goodwill and purchased intangibles 
our acquisitions of moss  octane  eclass  ileverage and rightpoint were each accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
accordingly  we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets representing the excess of the purchase price paid over the fair value of net assets acquired 
the amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the increase was due to the intangible assets recorded during and as part of our review of our third quarter financial results we performed an impairment test due to the existence of impairment indicators 
the impairment indicators included  among others  the significant decline in our stock price  the net book value of assets significantly exceeded our market capitalization  and the overall decline in industry growth rates that have negatively impacted our revenues and forecasted revenue growth rates 
we recorded an impairment charge of billion in the quarter ended september  to reduce goodwill and other intangible assets associated with all of our acquisitions to reflect their current estimated fair market value 
fair market value was determined based on discounted future cash flows 
it is possible that the estimates and assumptions used under our impairment test may change in the short term resulting in the need to further write down our goodwill and other long lived assets 
stock based compensation 
stock based compensation consists of amortization of deferred compensation in connection with stock option grants and sales of stock to employees at exercise or sales prices below the deemed fair market value of our common stock and compensation related to equity instruments issued to non employees for services rendered 
as of december   deferred compensation remaining to be amortized totaled million 
other income  net other income decreased to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the decrease was due to a decrease in interest income primarily as a result of a decrease in the average rate of return on our investments and lower average cash and investment balances 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   our primary sources of liquidity consisted of million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments and million in long term investments for a total of million in cash and investments 
net cash used in operating activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in operating activities for each period was primarily the result of net losses in those periods  less non cash charges for amortization and write down of goodwill and purchased intangibles  restructuring costs  and in process research and development costs 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  also was the result of a decrease in accrued liabilities  which was offset by a decrease in accounts receivable and an increase in deferred revenue 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  also was the result of a decrease in accrued liabilities and in deferred revenue  which was offset by a decrease in accounts receivable 
cash used in operating activities for the year ended december  also was the result of an increase in accounts receivable  which was partially offset by an increase in deferred revenue 
we expect to continue to incur net losses and to use cash in operating activities but at reduced levels compared to we expect to incur significant operating expenses  particularly research and development and sales and marketing expenses  for the foreseeable future in order to execute our business plan 
we anticipate that such operating expenses will comprise a material expenditure of our cash resources 
as a result  our net cash flows will depend on the level of future revenues and our ability to effectively manage infrastructure costs 
net cash used in investing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash used in investing activities for these years resulted primarily from the purchases of investments  net of sales of investments 
net investments purchased are primarily comprised of investment grade securities such as government notes and bonds with maturities which do not exceed months 
to a lesser extent  cash used from investing activities resulted from the purchase of property and equipment 
cash used in investing activities for the year ended december  was also the result of the direct costs of our acquisitions which was partially offset by cash acquired in acquisitions 
net cash provided by financing activities totaled million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
cash provided by financing activities for the years ended december  and resulted from the receipt of proceeds from the issuance of common stock pursuant to the exercise of stock options and our employee stock purchase plan 
cash provided by financing activities for the year ended december  was primarily the result of the receipt of proceeds from our secondary offering completed during the first quarter of from time to time  we are required to obtain letters of credit that serve as collateral for our obligations to third parties under facility lease agreements 
these letters of credit are secured by cash and cash equivalents and are recorded as restricted cash in the balance sheet 
as of december   we had million of restricted cash  million of which are classified as short term and relate to facility lease agreements that have expiration dates in  and million of which are classified as long term and relate to facility lease agreements that have expiration dates greater than twelve months from december  we lease certain equipment and our facilities under capital and operating lease agreements which expire at various dates through in addition  we receive sublease income from noncancelable subleases of excess facilities 
future minimum lease payments due and receivable under these leases as of december  were as follows in thousands year ending december  capital leases due operating leases due sublease income receivable total  net and thereafter    net operating lease commitments shown above include million of operating lease commitments under leases for abandoned facilities which are recorded as restructuring costs in the accompanying balance sheet as of december  we do not have commercial commitments under lines of credit  standby lines of credit  guarantees  standby repurchase obligations or other such arrangements 
although our existing cash  cash equivalents and investment balances are expected to decline in the aggregate  we believe that these balances will be sufficient to meet our anticipated liquidity needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least months 
if we require additional capital resources to grow our business internally or to acquire complementary technologies and businesses at any time in the future  we may seek to liquidate our long term investments  issue additional equity or debt securities or secure a bank line of credit 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
we cannot assure you that any financing arrangements will be available in amounts or on terms acceptable to us in the future 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the staff of the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit and disposal activities sfas 
this statement revises the accounting treatment for the cost of exit and disposal activities under emerging issues task force issue  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity eitf no 

sfas requires companies to record exit or disposal costs when they are incurred and can be measured at fair value 
the recorded liability will subsequently be adjusted for changes in estimated cash flows 
commitment to a plan to exit an activity or dispose of long lived assets will no longer be sufficient to record a one time charge for most anticipated costs 
the provisions of sfas are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  companies may not restate previously issued financial statements for the effect of the provisions of sfas and liabilities that a company previously recorded under eitf issue no 
will not be affected 
we do not believe that the adoption of sfas will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  fin 
in general  fin applies to contracts or indemnification agreements that require the guarantor to make payments to the guaranteed party contingent upon the occurrence of a specified event that is related to an asset  liability  or an equity security of the guaranteed party 
fin requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures  even when the likelihood of making any payments under the guarantee is remote  which is a change from current practice 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  in accordance with these disclosure requirements  we discuss in notes to consolidated financial statements our warranty and intellectual property indemnification provisions generally included in our software license agreements with our customers 
in addition  fin requires on a prospective basis that certain guarantees issued or modified after december  be recorded at fair value 
this differs from current practice  under which a liability is recorded when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
we do not believe that these provisions will result in a material impact to our financial statements or that our standard warranty and indemnification provisions will be required to be recorded at fair value in future periods 
however  the accounting profession and regulatory agencies continue to discuss various provisions of this pronouncement with the objective of providing additional guidance on its application 
this could result in an unanticipated change in the way we account for these provisions in future periods 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables eitf no 

eitf no 
provides guidance on how to account for arrangements that involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services or rights to use assets 
the provisions of eitf no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into after january  we do not believe that the adoption of eitf no 
will have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas and apb no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
while sfas does not amend sfas to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas or the intrinsic value method of apb since we account for our stock based compensation under apb  and have no current plans on switching to sfas  the impact of sfas will be limited to the interim reporting of the effects on net income and earnings per share if the company accounted for stock based compensation under sfas sfas is effective for fiscal years ending after december  in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin arb no 
 consolidated financial statements 
fin establishes accounting guidance for consolidation of a variable interest entity vie  formerly referred to as special purpose entities 
fin applies to any business enterprise  both public and private  that has a controlling interest  contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie 
fin provides guidance for determining when an entity  the primary beneficiary  should consolidate another entity  a vie  that functions to support the activities of the primary beneficiary 
we currently have no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a vie and therefore the adoption will not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the following discusses our exposure to market risk related to changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
this discussion contains forward looking statements that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could vary materially as a result of a number of factors including those set forth in the risk factors section of this annual report on form k 
foreign currency exchange rate risk the majority of our operations are based in the united states and  accordingly  the majority of our transactions are denominated in us dollars 
we do have foreign based operations  however  where transactions are denominated in foreign currencies and are subject to market risk with respect to fluctuations in the relative value of currencies 
as of december   we had international operations in asia  australia  europe and latin america and conduct transactions in the local currency of each location 
to date  our exposure to fluctuations in the relative value of other currencies has been limited because substantially all of our assets are denominated in us dollars  and those assets which are not denominated in us dollars have generally been denominated in historically stable currencies 
the impact to our financial statements has therefore not been material 
to date  we have not entered into any foreign exchange hedges or other derivative financial instruments 
we will continue to evaluate our exposure to foreign currency exchange rate risk on a regular basis 
interest rate risk our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates primarily affects our investment portfolio 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
this is accomplished by investing in diversified investments  consisting only of investment grade securities 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
as of december   we held million in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash consisting of highly liquid short term investments having original maturity dates of no more than days 
declines of interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our highly liquid short term investments 
based upon our balance of cash and cash equivalents  a decrease in interest rates of basis points would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately million 
due to the nature of our highly liquid cash equivalents  a change in interest rates would not materially change the fair market value of our cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash 
as of december   we held million in short term investments and long term investments  each of which consisted of taxable fixed income securities having original maturity dates between three months and two years 
a decline in interest rates over time would reduce our interest income from our short term and long term investments 
a decrease in interest rates of basis points would cause a corresponding decrease in our annual interest income of approximately million 
an increase in interest rates over time would cause the fair market value of our portfolio to decline 
an immediate and uniform increase in interest rates of basis points would cause the fair market value of these items to decrease by approximately million 
as of december   we did not have any debt outstanding other than capital lease obligations 
the following summarizes our investments  weighted average yields and expected maturity dates as of december  in thousands  except interest rates thereafter total corporate bonds   weighted average yield government notes bonds   weighted average yield total investment securities   government notes bonds consists primarily of government agency notes and includes  to a lesser extent  investments in taxable municipal bonds
