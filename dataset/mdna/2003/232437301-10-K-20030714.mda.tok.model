the financial section of the cyanotech annual report to stockholders consisting of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  the consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the company s consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which assumes continuity of operations and realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business

the company s working capital at march  was  with cash balances amounting to  net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities for the years ended march  and amounted to  and  respectively 
accordingly this causes substantial doubt as to the ability of the company to continue as a going concern

there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that the company will return to generating profit on either a quarterly or annual basis 
company overview and critical accounting policies and estimates cyanotech corporation is a worldwide leader in the development and commercialization of high value natural products derived from microalgae  a diverse group of over  species of microscopic plants which have a wide range of physiological and biochemical characteristics and naturally contain high levels of proteins  amino acids  vitamins  pigments and enzymes 
since  we have designed  developed and implemented proprietary production and harvesting technologies  systems and processes which eliminate many of the stability and contamination problems frequently encountered in the production of microalgae 
we believe that our technology  systems  processes and favorable growing location permit year round harvesting of our microalgal products in a cost effective manner 
currently  cyanotech operates as a single segment  producing and selling natural products from microalgae for the nutritional supplement  aquaculture feed  animal nutrition  and immunological diagnostics markets 
in response to sec release no 
 cautionary advice regarding disclosure about critical accounting policies  the company has identified certain of its policies as being of particular importance to the understanding of its financial position and results of operations and which require the application of significant judgement by cyanotech management 
inventory valuation inventories are stated at the lower of cost which approximates first in  first out or market 
market is determined by net realizable value 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenue when goods are shipped and when significant risks and benefits of ownership are transferred 
amounts received in advance under sales and distribution agreements for the right to sell and distribute the company s products are recognized as revenues on a straight line basis over the term of such agreements 
equipment and leasehold improvements equipment and leasehold improvements are stated at cost 
depreciation and amortization are provided using the straight line method over the estimated useful lives for equipment and furniture and fixtures  and the shorter of the lease terms or estimated useful lives for leasehold improvements as described in the section notes to consolidated financial statements included in this report 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their tax bases and operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted income tax rates applicable to the period in which the deferred tax assets or liabilities are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
impairment of long lived assets the financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of 
sfas no 
also changes the criteria for classifying an asset as held for sale  and broadens the scope of businesses to be disposed of that qualify for reporting as discontinued operations and changes the timing of recognizing losses on such operations 
the company adopted sfas no 
on april  the adoption of sfas no 
did not affect the company s consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with sfas no 
 long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  and purchased intangibles subject to amortization  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
assets to be disposed of would be separately presented in the balance sheet and reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell  and are no longer depreciated 
the assets and liabilities of a disposed group classified as held for sale would be presented separately in the appropriate asset and liability sections of the balance sheet 
goodwill and intangible assets not subject to amortization are tested annually for impairment  and are tested for impairment more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount exceeds the asset s fair value 
prior to the adoption of sfas no 
 the company accounted for long lived assets in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates

also contributing to the increase in operating costs were higher research and development expenses of approximately  related primarily to scientific clinical trials

variability of results cyanotech corporation was formed in and did not become profitable on an annual basis until fiscal the twelve month period ended december  
from fiscal through fiscal  the company had total net sales of  and total net income of  from fiscal through fiscal  the company had total net sales of  and net losses totaling  as of march   our accumulated deficit is  there can be no assurance that we will return to generating profits on either a quarterly or an annual basis 
we have experienced significant quarterly fluctuations in operating results and anticipate that these fluctuations may continue in future periods 
future operating results may fluctuate as a result of changes in sales to our largest customers  new product introductions  production difficulties  weather patterns  the mix between sales of bulk products and packaged consumer products  start up costs associated with new facilities  expansion into new markets  sales promotions  competition  increased energy costs  foreign exchange fluctuations  the announcement or introduction of new products by our competitors  changes in our customer mix  overall trends in the market for our products  government regulations and other factors beyond our control 
while a significant portion of our expense levels are relatively fixed  and the timing of increases in expense levels is based in large part on our forecasts of future sales  if net sales are below expectations in any given period  the adverse impact on results of operations may be magnified by our inability to adjust spending quickly enough to compensate for the sales shortfall 
we may also choose to reduce prices or increase spending in response to market conditions  which may have a material adverse effect on the company s financial condition  results of operations and liquidity 
the company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis  to comply with the terms of its financing agreements  to obtain additional financing or refinancing as may be required  to attain profitability  or a combination thereof 
there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that the company will return to generating profit on either a quarterly or annual basis

the term loan has a maturity date of may  and is payable in equal monthly principal and interest payments of approximately  commencing june   at march  and

the warrant expires in april and has an exercise price of per share 
the warrant may only be exercised after the company has repaid the term loan in full 
the term loan contains restrictive covenants which included  among others  maintenance of an annual minimum debt service coverage ratio 
the company failed to meet this covenant requirement for the year ended march  but received from the lender a waiver of the covenant violation until the year ending march  in october  this covenant was deleted from the term loan by the lender 
at march  the company was in compliance with all restrictive covenants of the term loan 
in connection with the term loan  the company is prohibited from declaring common stock dividends without the lender s prior written consent

in may  the company reached an agreement with the holders of the debentures to extend the maturity date by six months to october  in exchange for the extension  the company agreed to reduce the conversion price from per share to per share the approximate market value at date of issuance  increase the interest rate during the remaining period the debentures are outstanding from to  issue two year warrants to the debenture holders to purchase additional shares of common stock of cyanotech in an amount equal to thirty percent of the shares into which the debentures are convertible at per share  and reduce the forced conversion price at which the company can require the conversion of the debentures from per share to per share 
the terms of the aforementioned warrant issued to the placement agent in conjunction with the initial placement were also revised in this extension agreement

common stock listing during fiscal  the company s common stock was traded on the nasdaq national market 
on june  the company received a delisting warning letter from nasdaq for failure to comply with the per share minimum bid price 
cyanotech had calendar days  or until september   to regain compliance 
the company was unable to regain compliance prior to september   and subsequently applied for  and received listing for its common stock on the nasdaq smallcap market 
listing on the nasdaq smallcap market provided the company a calendar day grace period  or until december  to regain compliance 
the company failed to regain compliance before the end of this grace period but was eligible for an additional calendar day grace period  or until june  to demonstrate compliance  provided that it met nasdaq listing criteria for the smallcap market 
the company was unable to attain the per share value prior to june  but met the other listing criteria for the smallcap market 
however  on june   the company received notification from nasdaq that under marketplace rule c a  the compliance period for listing on the smallcap market was extended from to calendar days for companies which met certain heightened criteria 
the company met the initial listing requirements and in accordance with marketplace rule c d  has been provided an additional calendar days  or until september  to regain compliance with the per share minimum bid price requirement 
as a result  as of the date of this report  the company s common stock continues to be listed on the nasdaq smallcap market under symbol cyan 
if at anytime before september   the bid price of the company s common stock closes at per share or more for a minimum of consecutive trading days  nasdaq staff will provide written notification that the company complies with listing requirements under marketplace rule a 
under certain circumstances  to ensure that company can sustain long term compliance  nasdaq staff may require that the closing bid price equals per share or greater for more than consecutive business days  but  generally  not more than consecutive business days before determining that the company complies 
if compliance with this rule cannot be demonstrated by september   nasdaq staff will provide written notification that the company s securities will be delisted from the smallcap market and begin trading on the nasdaq over the counter bulletin boards 
in such case common stock of the company will be traded on a less active market to the possible detriment of the stockholders 
at that time  the company may appeal the nasdaq staff s determination to a listing qualifications panel 
the accompanying consolidated financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis  which assumes continuity of operations and realization of assets and liquidation of liabilities in the ordinary course of business 
during the years ended march   and  the company incurred losses of   and  respectively 
the company s working capital at march  was  with cash balances amounting to  net cash and cash equivalents used in operating activities for the years ended march  and amounted to  and  respectively 
accordingly  this causes substantial doubt as to the ability of the company to continue as a going concern 
the company s continuation as a going concern is dependent upon its ability to generate sufficient cash flow to meet its obligations on a timely basis  to comply with the terms of its financing agreements  to obtain additional financing or refinancing as may be required  to attain profitability  or a combination thereof 
the company is pursuing several sources of additional financing but there can be no assurance that these efforts will be successful or that the company will return to generating profit on either a quarterly or annual basis
