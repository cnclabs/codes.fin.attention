item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations forward looking statements this document contains certain forward looking statements  which may be identified by the use of words such as believe  expect  anticipate  should  planned  estimated  and potential 
examples of forward looking statements include  but are not limited to  estimates with respect to our financial condition  results of operations and business that are subject to various factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from these estimates  and most other statements that are not historical in nature 
these factors include  but are not limited to  general and local economic conditions  changes in interest rates  deposit flows  demand for mortgage and other loans  real estate values  and competition  changes in accounting principles  policies  or guidelines  changes in legislation or regulation  and other economic  competitive  governmental  regulatory  and technological factors affecting our operations  pricing products  and services 
summary of critical accounting policies the company s consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and prevailing practices of the banking industry 
application of these principles requires management to make estimates  assumptions  and judgments that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
these estimates  assumptions and judgments are based on information available as of the date of the financial statements  accordingly  as the information changes  the financial statements could reflect different estimates  assumptions and judgments 
certain policies and accounting principles inherently have a greater reliance on the use of estimates  assumptions and judgments and as such have a greater possibility of producing results that could be materially different than originally reported 
estimates  assumptions and judgments are necessary when assets and liabilities are required to be recorded at fair value  when a decline in the value of an asset not carried on the financial statements at fair value warrants an impairment write down or valuation reserve to be established  or when an asset or liability needs to be recorded contingent upon a future event 
carrying assets and liabilities at fair value inherently results in more financial statement volatility 
the fair values and the information used to record valuation adjustments for certain assets and liabilities are based either on quoted market prices or are provided by other provided by other third party sources when available 
when third party information is not available  valuation adjustments are estimated in good faith by management primarily through the use of internal cash flow modeling techniques 
a summary of the company s significant accounting policies is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the disclosures presented in the other financial statement notes and in this management s discussion and analysis section  provide information on how significant assets and liabilities are valued in the financial statements and how those values are determined 
management has identified the determination of the allowance for loan losses and the determination of the fair value of financial instruments as the accounting areas that require the most subjective and complex judgments  and as such could be the most subject to revision as new information becomes available 
the allowance for loan losses is a valuation allowance for probable incurred credit losses 
management estimates the allowance balance on a quarterly basis based on past loan loss experience  the nature and volume of the portfolio  peer group information  adverse situations that may effect the borrower s ability to repay  estimated value of any underlying collateral  and prevailing economic conditions 
this evaluation is inherently subjective  as it requires estimates that are susceptible to significant revision  as more information becomes available or as future events change 
the fair values of financial instruments are estimated using relevant market information and other assumptions 
fair value estimates involve uncertainties and matters of significant judgment regarding interest rates  credit risk  prepayments  and other factors  especially in the absence of broad markets for particular items 
there is no ready market for a significant portion of the company s financial instruments 
accordingly  fair values are based on various factors relative to expected loss experience  current economic conditions  risk characteristics  and other factors 
the assumptions and estimates used in the fair value determination process are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and significant judgment and  therefore  fair values cannot be determined with precision 
changes in assumptions or in market conditions could significantly affect the estimates 
general chesterfield financial s results of operations depend primarily on net interest income 
net interest income is the difference between the interest income we earn on our interest earning assets  consisting primarily of loans  securities  and interest bearing deposits with other financial institutions  and the interest we pay on our interest bearing liabilities  primarily savings accounts and time deposits 
our provisions for loan losses  other income  and other expense also affect our results of operations 
other income consists primarily of insurance commissions and service charges on deposit accounts 
other expense consists primarily of noninterest expenses  including salaries and employee benefits  occupancy  equipment  data processing  and deposit insurance premiums 
our results of operations may also be affected significantly by general and local economic and competitive conditions  particularly those with respect to changes in market interest rates  governmental policies  and actions of regulatory authorities 
business strategy our current business strategy is to operate as a well capitalized  profitable  community oriented savings and loan association dedicated to providing quality customer service 
generally  we have sought to implement this strategy by emphasizing deposits as the primary source of funds and maintaining a substantial portion of the assets in local residential first mortgage loans 
specifically  the business strategy incorporates the following elements emphasizing one to four family residential real estate lending  managing interest rate risk by emphasizing shorter term mortgage loans and maintaining high levels of liquidity  conducting our business as a community oriented institution  and maintaining asset quality and capital strength 
highlights of the business strategy are as follows o emphasizing one to four family residential real estate lending 
historically  we have emphasized one to four family residential lending within our market area 
as of june   million  or of our total loan portfolio  consisted of one to four family residential real estate loans 
during the year ended june   we originated million of one to four family residential real estate loans 
although the yields on residential mortgage loans are often less than the yields on other types of loans  we intend to continue to emphasize one to four family lending because of our expertise with this type of lending and the relatively low delinquency rates on these loans compared to other loans 
o managing interest rate risk by emphasizing shorter term loans and maintaining high levels of liquidity 
in recent years  we have emphasized the origination of shorter term  or year residential mortgage loans and have maintained high levels of liquidity 
in addition  when a borrower refinances a loan during periods of decreasing interest rates  we actively seek to reduce the term of the refinanced loan 
while short term loans generally offer lower interest rates than long term loans  short term loans increase monthly cash flows and reprice more quickly  allowing us greater flexibility in periods of rising interest rates 
o conducting our business as a community oriented institution 
we are committed to meeting the financial needs of the communities in which we operate 
we are large enough to provide a range of personal and business financial services  and yet are still small enough to provide these services on a personalized and efficient basis 
we believe that we can be more effective in servicing our customers than many of our non local competitors because of our ability to quickly and effectively provide senior management responses to customer needs and inquiries 
our ability to provide these services is enhanced by the stability of our senior management  which has an average tenure with us of over years 
o maintaining asset quality and capital strength 
through our commitment to conservative loan underwriting guidelines and the emphasis on traditional residential mortgage loans  we have consistently experienced low levels of late payments and losses on loans 
as of june   we had  of nonperforming assets  which represented of total assets 
in addition  we maintain our financial strength by maintaining high capital levels 
at june   our ratio of shareholders equity to assets was

rate volume analysis the following table presents the dollar amount of changes in interest income and interest expense for major components of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
it distinguishes between the changes related to outstanding balances and those due to the changes in interest rates 
for each category of interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  information is provided on changes attributable to i changes in volume ie  changes in volume multiplied by old rate and ii changes in rate ie  changes in rate multiplied by old volume 
for purposes of this table  changes attributable to both rate and volume  which cannot be segregated  have been allocated proportionately to the change due to volume and the change due to rate

during the year ended june   the corporation repurchased  shares of its common stock at a cost of million  or an average cost of per share 
total shareholders equity as of june  was million  or of total assets  compared to million  or of total assets  at june  the decrease in shareholders equity was primarily due to the stock repurchase programs previously discussed

interest expense 
interest expense on deposits decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the same period in the decrease was primarily attributable to reductions in deposit rates paid  with the average cost of funds decreasing to for the current year  from for the prior year  offset to some extent by a million increase in the average balances of deposit accounts

provision for loan losses 
from august through december  the corporation originated  of community development loans thirteen loans to a real estate development company to acquire vacant lots and deteriorated buildings for future development 
the corporation has closely monitored these loans since origination and established  in specific valuation reserves on these loans through provisions for loan losses recorded in    and during october  nine of these parcels were sold and the entire principal balances of the related loans were recovered 
subsequent to the sale   of the  specific valuation reserve was recovered during the quarter ended december   as a negative loan loss provision 
a further review by management of the four remaining loans during the quarter ended march   indicated that an additional  of the specific valuation reserve could be recovered as a negative loan loss provision 
these loans  with principal balances of  at june  remain on nonaccrual loans 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the same period in insurance commissions generated by the association s insurance subsidiary  chesterfield insurance  increased  or  to million in  compared to million in other noninterest income decreased  or  to  for the year ended june   compared to  for the year ended june   primarily due to a  loss on the corporation s equity investment in a community development company  partially offset by a  increase in agency fees and other service charges by chesterfield insurance 
noninterest expense 
total noninterest expense increased  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the primary causes for the increase included a  or  increase in salaries and employee benefits  which included a  increase in expense from the amortization of shares granted in november under the corporation s recognition and retention plan  a  increase in employee stock ownership plan expense due to the increased fair value of shares released to participants  and a  increase in health insurance premiums 
data processing expenses increased  or  to  for  compared to  in  primarily due to additional software costs associated with upgrading internal systems 
equipment expense decreased  or  to  in  compared to  in  primarily due to a  acceleration of depreciation expense recorded in  and the subsequent replacement of computer equipment with newer  more cost effective systems  resulting in a  reduction in depreciation expense for fiscal insurance agency bad debt expense increased  to  in fiscal compared to  in fiscal  primarily the result of a  provision for an insurance premium receivable from a long term commercial client of chesterfield insurance 
during the current quarter  chesterfield insurance recovered  of this provision 
chesterfield insurance continues to aggressively pursue collection of this receivable 
other miscellaneous expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended june   compared to million for the year ended june   and included a  increase in insurance and surety bond premiums for the current year 
the annualized ratio of noninterest expense to average assets was in  compared to in  and the corporation s efficiency ratio was for  compared to for provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes of million for the year ended june  resulted in an effective tax rate of  compared to a provision of million and a effective tax rate for the same period last year 
the increase in the effective income tax rate results primarily from increased state income taxes due to reduced amounts of us government and agency interest income 
comparison of operating results for the years ended june  and general 
net income for the year ended june  was million  or diluted earnings per share  compared to net income of million for the year ended june  return on average assets for was  compared to for the improved return on assets in was primarily due to investment of proceeds from the mutual to stock conversion  while the related increase in average equity resulted in a decrease in return on equity to for  compared to for last year 
total interest income 
total interest income decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  an increase in average interest earning assets of million resulted in a volume increase of million in interest income that was offset by a rate induced decrease of million in interest income  netting a decrease in yield on interest earning assets of basis points  to for  from for the prior year 
the decrease in interest income was the result of the general decline in market interest rates for investments and loans and management s decision to reinvest funds from recently called or matured securities on a short term basis 
interest expense 
interest expense on deposits decreased by million  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the decrease was primarily attributable to the general decline in market interest rates for insured deposits and to management s repricing decisions  with the average cost of funds decreasing  to for the current year  from for last year 
a million net decrease in interest bearing deposits and a change in the deposit mix favoring time deposits resulted in a  volume increase in interest expense  while reduced rates accounted for a million decrease in interest expense

the net interest rate spread increased to from while the net interest margin increased to from 
the ratio of average interest earning assets to average interest bearing liabilities improved to for the year ended june   from for the same period last year 
provision for loan losses 
management made no additional provision for loan losses for the year ended june   compared to a  provision for the year ended june  the provision for was partially attributable to credit quality concerns associated with certain community development loans and charge offs recorded during the year 
see business asset quality 
the credit quality concerns associated with these loans related to the borrower s ability to successfully redevelop certain parcels of land located near chesterfield federal s main office 
management estimates the probable collectibility of these loans on an ongoing basis based on information made available by the borrower 
a development plan for certain parcels was terminated in  and management recorded provisions for the loans based on alternative uses of the land because of the continued uncertainty associated with the borrower s ability to successfully redevelop the parcels 
during the current year  four of the community development loans were put on nonaccrual status due to failure to make timely payments 
all of the related community development loans are reported as substandard for regulatory purposes 
after a review of the present collectibility of these loans  management determined that no additional provision for loan loss was required 
the allowance for loan losses decreased to of loans outstanding at june  from at june  the amount of the allowance is based on estimates  and the ultimate losses may vary from the estimates 
the allowance for loan losses as of june  is maintained at a level that represents management s best estimate of probable losses in the loan portfolio 
noninterest income 
noninterest income increased  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the same period in the increase was primarily attributable to insurance commissions at chesterfield insurance 
insurance commissions increased  or  to million in  compared to million in noninterest expense 
total noninterest expenses increased  or  to million for the year ended june   from million for the year ended june  the primary causes for the increase were a  or  increase in salaries and employee benefits  which included a  expense for chesterfield federal s recognition and retention plan  and a  or  increase in other expenses  which included a  increase in administrative expenses attributable to the newly formed holding company 
equipment expense increased  or  to  in  compared to  in  primarily because of a  change in estimate of the useful life of computers 
the computers are being replaced earlier than expected because they will not support updated software being provided by chesterfield federal s data processing service 
our annualized ratio of noninterest expense to average assets increased to in  compared to in  while our efficiency ratio improved to for the current year  from for the same period last year 
during the years ended june  and  chesterfield insurance incurred operating expenses of million and million  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to a  or  increase in salaries and employee benefits  which included a  expense for the recognition and retention plan both included in the consolidated numbers in the last paragraph 
chesterfield insurance reported unconsolidated net income of  for the year ended june  and net losses of  and  for the years ended june  and  respectively 
provision for income taxes 
the provision for income taxes of million for the year ended june   resulted in an effective tax rate of  compared to a provision of million and a effective tax rate for the same period last year 
liquidity and capital resources chesterfield federal s liquidity management objective is to ensure the availability of sufficient cash flows to meet all financial commitments and to capitalize on opportunities for expansion 
liquidity management addresses the ability to meet deposit withdrawals on demand or at contractual maturity and to fund new loans and investments as opportunities arise 
chesterfield federal s primary sources of internally generated funds are principal and interest payments on loans receivable  cash flows generated from operations  and cash flows generated by investments 
external sources of funds primarily consist of increases in deposits 
at june   chesterfield federal had loan commitments of million and unused lines of credit of million 
chesterfield federal has also purchased a million mortgage pool security that settles during july chesterfield federal believes that it has adequate resources to fund loan commitments as they arise 
if chesterfield federal requires funds beyond its internal funding capabilities  advances from the federal home loan bank of chicago could be made available 
at june   approximately million of time deposits were scheduled to mature within one year  and we expect that a portion of these time deposits will not be renewed upon maturity  which would reduce our liquidity 
if additional liquidity is needed  chesterfield federal is permitted to sell its existing loans in the secondary market 
however  chesterfield federal has not originated any loans for sale in the secondary market and is restricted from selling loans to some potential purchasers because chesterfield federal s loan documents contain provisions that are more favorable to borrowers than permitted by the seller servicer guidelines of entities like fannie mae or freddie mac 
chesterfield financial does not engage in any significant business activity other than owning the common stock of chesterfield federal 
chesterfield financial s primary source of funds is income from its investments and principal and interest payments received with respect to the employee stock ownership plan loan 
future dividends from chesterfield federal will also be a source of funds for chesterfield financial  however  as a stock savings and loan association  chesterfield federal is subject to regulatory limitations on its ability to pay cash dividends

gaap generally requires the measurement of financial position and operating results in terms of historical dollars without consideration for changes in the relative purchasing power of money over time due to inflation 
the impact of inflation is reflected in the increased cost of our operations 
unlike industrial companies  our assets and liabilities are primarily monetary in nature 
as a result  changes in market interest rates have a greater impact on performance than the effects of inflation 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk general 
as with other financial institutions  our most significant form of market risk is interest rate risk 
our assets  consisting primarily of mortgage loans  have longer maturities than our liabilities  consisting primarily of deposits 
as a result  a principal part of our business strategy is to manage interest rate risk and reduce the exposure of our net interest income to changes in market interest rates 
accordingly  chesterfield federal s board of directors has established an asset liability management committee  which is responsible for evaluating the interest rate risk inherent in chesterfield federal s assets and liabilities  determining the level of risk that is appropriate given its business strategy  operating environment  capital  liquidity  and performance objectives  and managing this risk consistent with the guidelines approved by the board of directors 
the asset liability management committee consists of senior management operating under a policy adopted by the board of directors and meets at least quarterly to review chesterfield federal s asset liability policies and interest rate risk position 
in recent years  management has sought to reduce interest rate risk by maintaining high levels of liquidity  and emphasizing the origination of shorter term   or year residential mortgage loans 
in addition  when a borrower refinances a loan during a period of decreasing interest rates  management actively seeks to reduce the term of the refinanced loan 
net portfolio value 
the office of thrift supervision requires the computation of amounts by which the net present value of an institution s cash flow from assets  liabilities  and off balance sheet items the institution s net portfolio value or npv would change in the event of a range of assumed changes in market interest rates 
the office of thrift supervision provides all institutions that file a consolidated maturity rate schedule as a part of their quarterly thrift financial report with an interest rate sensitivity report of npv 
the office of thrift supervision simulation model uses a discounted cash flow analysis and an option based pricing approach to measure the interest rate sensitivity of npv 
the office of thrift supervision model estimates the economic value of each type of asset  liability and off balance sheet contract under the assumption that the us treasury yield curve shifts instantaneously and parallel up and down to basis points in basis point increments 
a basis point equals one hundredth of one percentage point  and basis points equals one percentage point 
a change in interest rates to from would mean  for example  a basis point increase in the change in interest rates column below 
the office of thrift supervision provides chesterfield federal the results of the interest rate sensitivity model  which is based on information provided by chesterfield federal  to estimate the sensitivity of npv 
the table below sets forth  as of june   the estimated changes in chesterfield federal s npv that would result from the designated instantaneous changes in the us treasury yield curve 
net portfolio value as a percent net portfolio value of present value of assets change in interest rates estimated amount of percent basis points npv change percent npv ratio change dollars in thousands due to the abnormally low prevailing interest rate environment  the ots report did not provide npv estimates for and basis points 
certain shortcomings are inherent in the methodology used in the above interest rate risk measurement 
modeling changes in npv requires making certain assumptions that may or may not reflect the manner in which actual yields and costs respond to changes in market interest rates 
in this regard  the npv table presented assumes that the composition of chesterfield federal s interest sensitive assets and liabilities existing at the beginning of a period remain constant over the period being measured and assumes that a particular change in interest rates is reflected uniformly across the yield curve regardless of the duration or repricing of specific assets and liabilities 
accordingly  although the npv table provides an indication of chesterfield federal s interest rate risk exposure at a particular point in time  such measurements are not intended to and do not provide a precise forecast of the effect of changes in market interest rates on its net interest income and will differ from actual results
