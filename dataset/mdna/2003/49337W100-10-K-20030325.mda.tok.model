electric services overview we are the largest investor owned electric generator in new york state 
our subsidiaries own and operate large generating plants and smaller facilities which are comprised of generating units in nassau and suffolk counties on long island and the rockaway peninsula in queens 
in addition  we own  lease and operate a major generating facility in queens county in new york city  the ravenswood facility  which is comprised of large steam generating units and gas turbine generators 
as more fully described below  we i provide to lipa all operation  maintenance and construction services and significant administrative services relating to the long island electric transmission and distribution t d system through a management services agreement the msa  ii supply lipa with generating capacity  energy conversion and ancillary services through a power supply agreement the psa to allow lipa to provide electricity to its customers on long island  and iii manage all aspects of the fuel supply for our long island generating facilities  as well as all aspects of the capacity and energy owned by or under contract to lipa through an energy management agreement the ema 
each of the msa  psa and ema became effective on may  and are collectively referred to herein as the lipa agreements 
generating facility operations in june  we acquired the  megawatt ravenswood facility located in new york city from consolidated edison company of new york  inc consolidated edison for approximately million 
in order to reduce our initial cash requirements to finance this acquisition  we entered into an arrangement with an unaffiliated variable interest entity through which we lease the ravenswood facility 
under the arrangement  the variable interest entity acquired a portion of the facility directly from consolidated edison and leased it to our wholly owned subsidiary 
we have guaranteed all payment and performance obligations of our subsidiary under the lease 
the lease relates to approximately million of the acquisition cost of the facility  which is the amount of debt that would have been recorded on our consolidated balance sheet had the variable interest entity not been utilized and conventional debt financing been employed 
further  we would have recorded an asset in the same amount 
monthly lease payments are for interest only 
the lease qualifies as an operating lease for financial reporting purposes while preserving our ownership of the facility for federal and state income tax purposes 
we believe that the fair market value of the ravenswood facility  including the leased facilities  is in excess of its acquisition cost see discussion concerning the financial accounting standards board issued interpretation no 
in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the ravenswood facility sells capacity  energy and ancillary services into the new york independent system operator nyiso energy market at market based rates  subject to mitigation 
the plant has the ability to provide approximately of new york city s capacity requirements and is a strategic asset that is available to serve residents and businesses in new york city 
reliability improvement investments at our ravenswood facility reduced the forced outage rate for that facility from in to under in  and decreasing the amount of time our generating units are offline for repair allows us to increase sales 
we are also in the process of expanding our ravenswood facility by adding a megawatt state of the art gas fired combined cycle unit 
on september   we received approval for the expansion from new york state s siting board on electric generation and the environment siting board and construction is underway 
we anticipate that the new unit will be operational in late further  two megawatt generating facilities located on long island were placed into service in june and july the capacity of and energy from these facilities are dedicated to lipa under year contracts 
the competitive wholesale market for capacity  energy and ancillary services administered by the nyiso is still evolving and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc has adopted several price mitigation measures which are subject to rehearing and possible judicial review 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation regulatory issues and competitive environment for a further discussion of these matters 
natural gas or oil can be used to power of our generating units 
in recent years  we have reconfigured several of our facilities to enable them to burn either natural gas or oil  thus enabling us to switch periodically between fuel alternatives based upon cost and seasonal environmental requirements 
through other innovative technological approaches  we increased installed capacity in our generating facilities by megawatts  and we instituted a program to reduce nitrogen oxides for improved environmental performance 
the following table indicates the summer capacity of all of our steam generation facilities and gas turbine gt units as reported to the nyiso location of units description fuel units mw long island city steam turbine dual  northport  li steam turbine dual  port jefferson  li steam turbine dual glenwood  li steam turbine gas island park  li steam turbine dual far rockaway  li steam turbine dual long island city gt units dual throughout li gt units dual throughout li gt units oil  total  dual oil oil  residual oil or kerosene  and natural gas in addition to the mw expansion of the ravenswood facility  we plan to construct another mw combined cycle plant in melville  long island 
in january  we filed an application for approval with the siting board for this project  and in february  the presiding examiners issued a recommended decision recommending that the siting board issue a certificate of environmental capability and public need for the project 
action by the siting board is expected in march in addition  as part of our growth strategy  we continually evaluate the possible acquisition of additional generating facilities in the northeast 
however  we are unable to predict when or if such facilities will be acquired and the effect any such acquired facilities will have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
lipa agreements lipa is a corporate municipal instrumentality and a political subdivision of the state of new york 
on may   certain of lilco s business units were merged with keyspan and lilco s common stock and remaining assets were acquired by lipa 
at the time of this transaction  three major long term service agreements were also executed between keyspan and lipa that provide for keyspan to provide  mw of power generation capacity and energy conversion services  operation  maintenance and capital improvement services for lipa s transmission and distribution system  and the performance of energy management services 
power supply agreement 
a keyspan subsidiary sells to lipa all of the capacity and  to the extent requested  energy conversion services from our existing long island based oil and gas fired generating plants 
sales of capacity and energy conversion services are made under rates approved by the ferc 
under the terms of the psa  rates will be reestablished for the contract year commencing january  by recalculating the revenue requirement underlying those rates 
we anticipate submitting to the ferc a rate filing reflecting the recalculated revenue requirement in the fall of we are unable to predict the outcome of that proceeding at this time 
rates charged to lipa include a fixed and variable component 
the variable component is billed to lipa on a monthly basis and is dependent on the number of megawatt hours dispatched 
lipa has no obligation to purchase energy conversion services from us and is able to purchase energy or energy conversion services on a least cost basis from all available sources consistent with existing interconnection limitations of the t d system 
the psa provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for the maintenance of the output capability and the efficiency of the generating facilities 
in  we earned million in incentives under the psa 
the psa runs for a term of fifteen years 
the psa is renewable for an additional years on similar terms at lipa s option 
however  the psa provides lipa the option of electing to reduce or ramp down the capacity it purchases from us in accordance with agreed upon schedules 
in years seven through ten of the psa  if lipa elects to ramp down  we are entitled to receive payment for of the present value of the capacity charges otherwise payable over the remaining term of the psa 
if lipa ramps down the generation capacity in years through of the psa  the capacity charges otherwise payable by lipa will be reduced in accordance with a formula established in the psa 
if lipa exercises its ramp down option  keyspan may use any capacity released by lipa to bid on new lipa capacity requirements or to replace other ramped down capacity 
if we continue to operate the ramped down capacity  the psa requires us to use reasonable efforts to market the capacity and energy from the ramped down capacity and to share any profits with lipa 
the psa will be terminated in the event that lipa exercises its right to purchase  at fair market value  all of the long island generating facilities pursuant to the generation purchase rights agreement discussed in greater detail below 
we also have an inventory of sulfur dioxide so and nitrogen oxide nox emission allowances that may be sold to third party purchasers 
the amount of allowances varies from year to year relative to the level of emissions from the long island generating facilities  which is greatly dependent on the mix of natural gas and fuel oil used for generation and the amount of purchased power that is imported onto long island 
in accordance with the psa  of emission allowance sales revenues attributable to the long island generating facilities is retained by keyspan and the other is credited to lipa 
lipa also has a right of first refusal on any potential emission allowance sales of the long island generating facilities 
additionally  keyspan voluntarily entered into a memorandum of understanding with the new york state department of environmental conservation dec  which memorandum prohibits the sale of so allowances into certain states and requires the purchaser to be bound by the same restriction  which may marginally affect the market value of the allowances 
management services agreement 
under the msa  we perform day to day operation and maintenance services and capital improvements for lipa s transmission and distribution system  including  among other functions  transmission and distribution facility operations  customer service  billing and collection  meter reading  planning  engineering  and construction  all in accordance with policies and procedures adopted by lipa 
keyspan furnishes such services as an independent contractor and does not have any ownership or leasehold interest in the transmission and distribution system 
in exchange for providing these services  we are reimbursed for our budgeted costs and entitled to earn an annual management fee of million and may also earn certain cost based incentives  or be responsible for certain cost based penalties 
the incentives provide for us to retain of the first million of budget underruns and of any additional budget underruns up to of the total cost budget 
thereafter  all savings accrue to lipa 
the penalties require us to absorb any total cost budget overruns up to a maximum of million in any contract year 
in addition to the foregoing cost based incentives and penalties  we are eligible for performance based incentives for performance above certain threshold target levels and subject to disincentives for performance below certain other threshold levels  with an intermediate band of performance in which neither incentives nor disincentives will apply  for system reliability  worker safety  and customer satisfaction 
in  we earned million in non cost performance incentives 
the msa was originally set to expire on may   but was extended through december  the msa was extended in exchange for an extension of the option period under the generation purchase rights agreement as more fully described in the discussion on generation purchase rights agreement below 
energy management agreement 
pursuant to the ema  keyspan i procures and manages fuel supplies for lipa to fuel our long island generating facilities acquired from lilco in  ii performs off system capacity and energy purchases on a least cost basis to meet lipa s needs  and iii makes off system sales of output from the long island generating facilities and other power supplies either owned or under contract to lipa 
lipa is entitled to two thirds of the profit from any off system electricity sales arranged by us 
the term for the fuel supply service provided in i above is fifteen years  expiring may   and the term for the off system purchases and sales services provided in ii and iii above is eight years  expiring may  in exchange for these services  we earn an annual fee of million  plus an allowance for certain costs incurred in performing services under the ema 
the ema further provides incentives and disincentives up to million annually for control of the cost of fuel and electricity purchased on behalf of lipa 
in  we earned ema incentives in an aggregate of million 
generation purchase rights agreement 
under the generation purchase rights agreement gpra  lipa had the right for a one year period  beginning may   to acquire all of our long island based generating assets formerly owned by lilco at fair market value at the time of the exercise of such right 
by agreement dated march   lipa and keyspan amended the gpra to provide for a new six month option period ending on may  the other terms of the option reflected in the gpra remain unchanged 
the gpra and msa extensions were the result of an initiative established by lipa to work with keyspan and others to review long island s long term energy needs 
we will work with lipa to jointly analyze new energy supply options including re powering existing plants  renewable energy technologies  distributed generation  conservation initiatives and retail competition 
the extension also allows both lipa and us to explore alternatives to the gpra including the sale of some  or all of our currently existing long island generation plants to lipa  or the sale of some or all of these plants to other private operators 
other rights 
pursuant to other agreements between lipa and us  certain future rights have been granted to lipa 
subject to certain conditions  these rights include the right for years to lease or purchase  at fair market value  parcels of land and to acquire unlimited access to  as well as appropriate easements at  the long island generating facilities for the purpose of constructing new electric generating facilities to be owned by lipa or its designee 
subject to this right granted to lipa  keyspan has the right to sell or lease property on or adjoining the long island generating facilities to third parties 
in addition  lipa has acquired a parcel of land at the site of the former shoreham nuclear power station site suitable as the terminus for a potential transmission cable under long island sound or the potential site of a new gas fired combined cycle generating facility 
we own the common plant such as administrative office buildings and computer systems formerly owned by lilco and recover an allocable share of the carrying costs of such plant through the msa 
keyspan has agreed to provide lipa  for a period of years  the right to enter into leases at fair market value for common plant or sub contract for common services which it may assign to a subsequent manager of the transmission and distribution system 
we have also agreed i for a period of years not to compete with lipa as a provider of transmission or distribution service on long island  ii that lipa will share in synergy ie  efficiency savings over a year period attributed to the may  transaction which resulted in the formation of keyspan estimated to be approximately billion  which savings are incorporated into the cost structure under the lipa agreements  and iii generally not to commence any tax certiorari case until termination of the psa challenging certain property tax assessments relating to the former lilco long island generating facilities 
guarantees and indemnities 
we have entered into agreements with lipa to provide for the guarantee of certain obligations  indemnification against certain liabilities and allocation of responsibility and liability for certain pre existing obligations and liabilities 
in general  liabilities associated with the lilco assets transferred to keyspan  have been assumed by keyspan  and liabilities associated with the assets acquired by lipa  are borne by lipa  subject to certain specified exceptions 
we have assumed all liabilities arising from all manufactured gas plant mgp operations of lilco and its predecessors  and lipa has assumed certain liabilities relating to the former lilco long island generating facilities and all liabilities traceable to the business and operations conducted by lipa after completion of the keyspan lilco transaction 
an agreement also provides for an allocation of liabilities which relate to the assets that were common to the operations of lilco and or shared services and are not traceable directly to either the business or operations conducted by lipa or keyspan 
other 
in late  lipa announced  and we acknowledged  that during and we had made an error in reporting lipa s electric system requirements  resulting in an overestimation of lipa s unbilled revenue 
lipa and keyspan have continued to review and audit the reporting electric system requirements for and earlier periods  and have determined that  in addition to the and overestimation  unbilled revenues for prior periods back to may were slightly underestimated 
based on the review  the total overestimation in unbilled revenue was approximately million 
the lipa revenue estimation error did not have an impact on lipa s electric rates charged to its customers or to its cash balances 
we do not believe that the lipa revenue estimation error will have any material adverse impact on the various agreements with lipa or on our financial or operating performance

energy services overview our energy services segment provides services to customers located primarily within new york  new jersey  massachusetts  new hampshire  rhode island and pennsylvania through various subsidiaries which operate under the following three principal lines of business i home energy services  which provides residential and small commercial customers with service and maintenance of energy systems and appliances  as well as the competitive retail supply of natural gas and electricity  ii business solutions  which provides engineering  consulting and construction services  related to the design  construction  installation  operation  maintenance and management of heating  cooling and power production equipment and systems for commercial and industrial customers  as well as the competitive retail supply of natural gas and electricity to large commercial  institutional and industrial customers certain subsidiaries within this line of business also engage or may engage in the financing and ownership of cogeneration  small power production  thermal energy  chilled water and related equipment and facilities  and iii fiber optic services in which we construct fiber optic systems and facilities and own and lease fiber optic cable to local  long distance  and trans atlantic carriers  as well as internet service providers 
the energy services segment has more than  employees and  service contracts  and is the number one oil to gas conversion contractor in new york and new england 
keyspan s energy services subsidiaries compete with local  regional and national mechanical contracting  hvac  plumbing  engineering  wholesale fiber optics carriers  and independent energy companies  in addition to electric utilities  independent power producers and local distribution companies 
competition is based largely upon pricing  availability and reliability of supply  technical and financial capabilities  regional presence  experience and customer service 
with our strong market presence in the northeast centered on our gas distribution and electric services operations and the long term trend towards further deregulation  we believe that we are well positioned to provide our customers with an expanded array of energy products and services through our unregulated energy service companies 
in  we discontinued the general contracting activities related to the former roy kay companies with the exception of work to be completed on existing contracts  based upon our view that the general contracting business was not a core competency of these companies 
as a result of our evaluation of the energy services business undertaken during  we decided to set certain limitations on the types of new general contracting activities in which our contracting subsidiaries may engage 
we also installed senior management personnel whom  among other things  have reviewed and continue to review and focus on our overall strategy of these businesses 
we are currently engaged in litigation concerning the roy kay companies 
for further information  see note to the consolidated financial statements  roy kay operations and note contractual obligations and contingencies legal matters for a further discussion 
although the roy kay companies are exiting the non energy related general contracting business  keyspan services  inc ksi  through its subsidiaries  may engage in general contracting where such activities involve contracts for construction activities that management is satisfied such subsidiary  either by itself or through one or more contracts with other ksi subsidiaries and or third parties  has the necessary resources to perform and which are primarily energy related as determined by sec rule or precedent under puhca eg  involving projects such as the construction of hvac  thermal  chilled water and other hvac facilities  renewable energy  cogeneration and other types of power production facilities and waste water treatment facilities 
ksi and its subsidiaries will not  however  enter into new contracts to provide general contracting services involving the construction of primarily non energy related facilities  as determined by sec rule or precedent under puhca 
in its order approving the acquisition by keyspan of eastern  the sec reserved jurisdiction on its determination of whether the energy services companies were retainable and required keyspan to file a post effective amendment regarding the retention of these energy services companies 
on june   we filed such a post effective amendment 
the sec has not made a determination  but we believe that the sec may find ample bases to approve of keyspan s continued operations in the energy services business  especially in light of the fact that other registered holding companies have been permitted to retain their energy service operations 
for additional information concerning the energy services segment  see the discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations energy services contained herein 
energy investments overview we are also engaged in energy investments which include i gas exploration and production activities  ii domestic pipelines and gas storage facilities  iii midstream natural gas processing activities in canada  iv natural gas distribution and pipeline activities in the united kingdom  and v certain other domestic energy related investments  such as providing meter reading equipment and services to municipal utilities  the transportation by truck of liquid natural gas  new fuel cell technologies and certain internet related activities 
gas exploration and production keyspan is engaged in the exploration and production of domestic natural gas and oil through our equity interest in the houston exploration company houston exploration and through our wholly owned subsidiary  keyspan exploration and production  llc keyspan exploration 
houston exploration was organized by kedny in to conduct natural gas and oil exploration and production activities 
it completed an initial public offering in and its shares are currently traded on the new york stock exchange under the symbol thx 
on february   houston exploration issued million shares of its common stock  the net proceeds of which were used to repurchase million shares of common stock owned by us 
as a result of the repurchase  our ownership interest in houston exploration was reduced from approximately to approximately 
additionally  there is an over allotment option for  shares  which if exercised would further reduce our ownership in houston exploration to 
at march   houston exploration s aggregate market capitalization was approximately million based upon the closing price on the new york stock exchange on february  of 
at march   houston exploration had approximately  shares of common stock  
par value  outstanding 
keyspan exploration is engaged in a joint venture with houston exploration to explore for natural gas and oil 
houston exploration contributed all of its undeveloped offshore leases to the joint venture for a working interest and keyspan exploration  acquired a working interest in all prospects to be drilled by the joint venture 
effective  the joint venture was modified to reflect that keyspan exploration would only participate in the development of wells that had previously been drilled and not participate in future exploration prospects 
in line with our stated strategy of exploring the monetization or divestiture of certain non core assets  in october  we sold a portion of our assets in the joint venture drilling program to houston exploration 
we received million in cash for our working interests in producing properties with an estimated bcfe of proved and provable reserves 
our gas exploration and production subsidiaries focus their operations offshore in the gulf of mexico and onshore in south texas  south louisiana  the arkoma basin  east texas and west virginia 
the geographic focus of these operations enables our subsidiaries to manage a comparatively large asset base with relatively few employees and to add and operate production at relatively low incremental costs 
our gas exploration and production subsidiaries seek to balance their offshore and onshore activities so that the lower risk and more stable production typically associated with onshore properties complement the high potential exploratory projects in the gulf of mexico by balancing risk and reducing volatility 
houston exploration s business strategy is to seek to continue to increase reserves  production and cash flow by pursuing internally generated prospects  primarily in the gulf of mexico  by conducting development and exploratory drilling on our offshore and onshore properties and by making selective opportune acquisitions 
offshore properties 
our interests in offshore properties are located in the shallow waters of the outer continental shelf of the gulf of mexico 
our interests in key producing properties are located in the western and central gulf of mexico and include the mustang island  high island  east cameron  vermilion and south timbalier areas 
we hold interests in blocks in federal and state waters  of which are developed 
through our subsidiaries  we operate of our developed blocks  which accounted for approximately of our interests in offshore production during we have a total of platforms and production cassions of which we operate since its inception in  the joint venture participated in wells  of which were successful exploratory and six development 
during  we drilled ten offshore wells  nine of which were successful  representing a success rate of 
of the successful wells drilled  six were exploratory and three were development 
the joint venture participated in four of the wells  two exploratory and two development  all of which were successful 
onshore properties 
our interests in south texas properties are concentrated in the charco  haynes and south trevino fields of zapata county  the alexander  hubbard and south laredo fields of webb county  and the north east thompsonville field in jim hogg county 
we own interests in producing wells  of which are operated by our subsidiaries 
our interests in arkoma basin properties are located in two primary areas the chismville massard field located in logan and sebastian counties of arkansas and the wilburton and panola fields located in latimer county  oklahoma 
we own working interests in producing natural gas wells  of which we operate other onshore properties are concentrated in three areas south louisiana  west virginia and east texas 
on a combined basis  we own working interests in producing wells  of which we operate 
during  we drilled onshore wells  of which were successful  representing a success rate of 
of the successful wells drilled  were drilled in south texas and were drilled in the arkoma basin 
of the successful wells drilled  were development and two were exploratory

domestic pipelines and gas storage facilities we also own an approximate interest in iroquois gas transmission system lp  the partnership that owns a mile pipeline that currently transports mdth of canadian gas supply daily from the new york canadian border to markets in the northeastern united states 
keyspan is also a shipper on iroquois and currently transports up to mdth of gas per day 
we are also participating in the islander east pipeline company llc islander east  an interstate pipeline joint venture with duke energy corporation 
the joint venture involves the construction  ownership and operation of a mile natural gas pipeline that will transport mdth of gas supply daily from nova scotia  canada to growing markets in connecticut  new york city and long island  new york 
increasing gas transmission capacity is necessary to meet the increased demand for natural gas in the northeast  which coincides with the growth strategy of our gas distribution business 
the project received a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the ferc authorizing the construction  operation and maintenance of the interstate natural gas pipeline facilities in connecticut and long island  ny islander east has obtained all required permits in new york state for the construction of the facility 
however  the state of connecticut has issued a moratorium on the issuance of permits relating to the construction of energy projects until june islander east has therefore been unable to obtain the necessary permits from the state of connecticut at this time 
islander east has also appealed a denial by the state of connecticut of the coastal zone management permit to the us department of commerce and such appeal is currently pending 
islander east is projected to be in service by year end we also have equity investments in two gas storage facilities in the state of new york honeoye storage corporation and steuben gas storage company 
we own a interest in honeoye  an underground gas storage facility which provides up to billion cubic feet of storage service to new york and new england 
additionally  we own of a partnership that has a interest in the steuben facility that provides up to billion cubic feet of storage service to new jersey and massachusetts 
on december   we acquired algonquin lng  lp  the owner and operator of a  barrel liquefied natural gas lng storage and receiving facility located in providence  rhode island  from duke energy for approximately million 
boston gas company is the facility s largest customer and contracts for more than half of its storage 
the facility  renamed keyspan lng  lp  is regulated by the ferc 
our investments in domestic pipelines and gas storage facilities are complimentary to our gas distribution and electric services businesses in that they provide energy infrastructure to support the growth of these businesses 
to the extent that opportunities become available for expanding our investments in these types of energy investments  keyspan will continue to consider such investments as strategic 
midstream natural gas processing activities in canada we also own of keyspan canada  a company with natural gas processing plants and gathering facilities located in western canada 
in october  we purchased the remaining interest in keyspan canada from our former partner  gulf canada resources limited 
the assets include interests in processing plants and associated gathering systems that can process approximately bcfe of natural gas daily  and provide associated natural gas liquids fractionation 
additionally  keyspan owns an approximate interest in taylor ngl lp which owns and operates two extraction plants  one located in british columbia  and one in alberta  canada 
we also consider our canadian operations to be non core assets and are also evaluating strategies to divest or monetize these assets 
natural gas distribution and pipeline activities in the united kingdom we own a interest in premier transmission limited and a interest in phoenix natural gas limited both in northern ireland 
premier is an mile pipeline to northern ireland from southwest scotland that has planned transportation capacity of approximately mdth of gas supply daily to markets in northern ireland 
phoenix is a gas distribution system serving the city of belfast  northern ireland 
keyspan also considers these assets non core and is evaluating the possible divestiture or monetization of these assets 
marine transportation activities discontinued operations our marine transportation subsidiary  midland enterprises  inc midland that was acquired as part of the eastern acquisition was divested and its operations discontinued 
we were required by the sec to divest this subsidiary by november   as its operations were determined not to be functionally related to our core utility operations as required by puhca 
on july   we announced that we closed the sale of midland to a subsidiary of ingram industries inc ingram and we received net proceeds of approximately million from the sale 
see note discontinued operations  for further information on the sale of our marine transportation business

environmental matters overview keyspan s ordinary business operations subject it to regulation in accordance with various federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations dealing with the environment  including air  water  and hazardous substances 
these requirements govern both our normal  ongoing operations and the remediation of impacted properties historically used in utility operations 
potential liability associated with our historical operations may be imposed without regard to fault  even if the activities were lawful at the time they occurred 
except as set forth below  or in note to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations and contingencies environmental matters  no material proceedings relating to environmental matters have been commenced or  to our knowledge  are contemplated by any federal  state or local agency against keyspan  and we are not a defendant in any material litigation with respect to any matter relating to the protection of the environment 
we believe that our operations are in substantial compliance with environmental laws and that requirements imposed by environmental laws are not likely to have a material adverse impact upon us 
we are also pursuing claims against insurance carriers and potentially responsible parties which seek the recovery of certain environmental costs associated with the investigation and remediation of contaminated properties 
we believe that investigation and remediation costs prudently incurred at facilities associated with utility operations  not recoverable through insurance or some other means  will be recoverable from our customers 
air 
the federal clean air act caa provides for the regulation of a variety of air emissions from new and existing electric generating plants 
we have submitted timely applications for permits in accordance with the requirements of title v of the amendments to the caa 
final permits have been issued for all of our electric generating facilities 
the permits allow our electric generating plants to continue to operate without any additional significant expenditures  except as described below 
our generating facilities are located within a caa severe ozone non attainment area  and are subject to phase i  ii and iii nox reduction requirements established under the ozone transportation commission otc memorandum of understanding 
our investments in boiler combustion modifications and the use of natural gas firing systems at our steam electric generating stations have enabled us to achieve the emission reductions required under phase i and ii of the otc memorandum in a cost effective manner 
we are required to be in compliance with the phase iii reduction requirements of the otc memorandum effective may  we expect to achieve such emission reductions in a cost effective manner through the completion of low nox combustion control systems  the use of natural gas fuel and the purchases of allowances when necessary 
expenditures for combustion control systems and natural gas fuel capability additions to address nox emission reductions begun in and ending in are expected to be between million and million 
water 
the federal clean water act provides for effluent limitations  to be implemented by a permit system  to regulate the discharge of pollutants into united states waters 
we possess permits for our generating units which authorize discharges from cooling water circulating systems and chemical treatment systems 
these permits are renewed from time to time  as required by regulation 
additional capital expenditures associated with the renewal of the surface water discharge permits for our power plants may be required by the dec 
we are currently monitoring impacts of our discharges on aquatic resources  in consultation with the dec 
until our monitoring obligations are completed and proposed changes to the environmental protection agency regulations under section of the clean water act are finalized  the need for and the cost of equipment upgrades  if any  cannot be determined 
land 
the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act of and certain similar state laws collectively superfund impose liability  regardless of fault  upon generators of hazardous substances for costs associated with remediating contaminated property 
in the course of our business operations  we generate materials which  after disposal  may become subject to superfund 
from time to time  we have received notices under superfund concerning possible claims with respect to sites where hazardous substances generated by keyspan and other potentially responsible parties were allegedly disposed 
the cost of these claims is not presently determinable but  if actually imposed on us  may be material to our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
keyspan has identified certain manufactured gas plant mgp sites which were historically owned or operated by its subsidiaries or such companies predecessors 
operations at these sites between the mid s to mid s may have resulted in the release of hazardous substances 
for a discussion on our mgp sites and further information concerning environmental matters  see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations and contingencies environmental matters 
competition  regulation and rate matters competition over the last several years  the natural gas and electric sectors of the regulated energy industry have undergone significant change as market forces moved towards replacing or supplementing rate regulation through the introduction of competition 
a significant number of natural gas and electric utilities reacted to the changing structure of the energy industry by entering into business combinations  with the goal of reducing common costs  gaining size to better withstand competitive pressures and business cycles  and attaining synergies from the combination of operations 
we engaged in two such combinations  the keyspan lilco transaction in and our november acquisition of eastern and energynorth 
for further information regarding the gas and electric industry  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation regulatory issues and competitive environment 
additionally  our non utility subsidiaries engaged in the energy services business compete with other mechanical  hvac  and engineering companies  and in new jersey are faced with competition from the regulated utilities that are still able to offer appliance repair and protection services 
regulation public utility holding companies  like keyspan  are regulated by the sec under puhca and to some extent by state utility commissions through the regulation of corporate  financial and affiliate activities of public utilities 
our utility subsidiaries are subject to extensive federal and state regulation by state utility commissions  ferc and the sec 
our gas and electric public utility companies are subject to either or both state and federal regulation 
in general  state public utility commissions  such as the new york public service commission nypsc  the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte and the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc regulate the provision of retail services  including the distribution and sale of natural gas and electricity to consumers 
the ferc regulates interstate natural gas transportation and electric transmission  and has jurisdiction over certain wholesale natural gas sales and wholesale electric sales 
in addition  our non utility subsidiaries are subject to a wide variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations with respect to their business activities  including but not limited to those affecting public sector projects  environmental and labor laws and regulations  state licensing requirements  as well as state laws and regulations concerning the competitive retail commodity supply 
state utility commissions our regulated utility subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the nypsc  dte and nhpuc 
the nypsc regulates kedny and kedli  and indirectly keyspan itself  through conditions that were included in the nypsc order authorizing the keyspan lilco transaction 
those conditions address the manner in which keyspan  its service company subsidiaries and its unregulated subsidiaries may interact with kedny and kedli 
the nypsc also regulates the safety  reliability and certain financial transactions of our long island generating facilities and our ravenswood generating facility under a lightened regulatory standard 
our kedne subsidiaries are subject to regulation by the dte and nhpuc 
our energy services subsidiaries which engage in the retail sale of gas and electricity are also subject to regulation by the nypsc and the new jersey board of public utilities 
for further information regarding the state regulatory commissions  see the discussion in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations regulation and rate matters 
federal energy regulatory commission the ferc regulates the sale of electricity at wholesale and the transmission of electricity in interstate commerce as well as certain corporate and financial activities of companies that are engaged in such activities 
the long island generating facilities and the ravenswood facility are subject to ferc regulation based on their wholesale energy transactions 
in  lipa  keyspan and the staff of ferc stipulated to a five year rate plan for the long island generating facilities with agreed upon yearly adjustments  which have been approved by ferc 
our ravenswood facility s rates are based on a market based rate application approved by ferc 
the rates that our ravenswood facility may charge are subject to mitigation measures due to market power concerns of ferc 
the mitigation measures are administered by the nyiso 
ferc retains the ability in future proceedings  either on its own motion or upon a complaint filed with ferc  to modify the ravenswood facility s rates  as well as the mitigation measures  if ferc concludes that it is in the public interest to do so 
keyspan currently bids and sells the energy  capacity and ancillary services from the ravenswood facility through the energy market operated by the nyiso 
for information concerning the nyiso  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operation regulatory issues and competitive environment 
the ferc also has jurisdiction to regulate certain natural gas sales for resale in interstate commerce  the transportation of natural gas in interstate commerce  and  unless an exemption applies  companies engaged in such activities 
the natural gas distribution activities of kedny  kedli  kedne and certain related intrastate gas transportation functions are not subject to ferc jurisdiction 
however  to the extent that kedny  kedli or kedne purchase or sell gas for resale in interstate commerce  such transactions are subject to ferc jurisdiction and have been authorized by the ferc 
our interests in iroquois  honeoye  steuben and algonquin lng are also fully regulated by ferc as natural gas companies 
securities and exchange commission as a result of the acquisition of eastern and energynorth  we became a registered holding company under puhca 
therefore  our corporate and financial activities and those of our subsidiaries  including their ability to pay dividends to us  are subject to regulation by the sec 
under our holding company structure  we have no independent operations or source of income of our own and conduct substantially all of our operations through our subsidiaries and  as a result  we depend on the earnings and cash flow of  and dividends or distributions from  our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt and contractual obligations 
furthermore  a substantial portion of our consolidated assets  earnings and cash flow is derived from the operations of our regulated utility subsidiaries  whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation by state regulatory authorities 
for additional information concerning regulation by the sec under puhca see the discussion under the heading securities and exchange commission regulation contained in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contained herein 
foreign regulation keyspan s foreign operations in northern ireland  conducted through premier and phoenix  are subject to licensing by the northern ireland department of economic development and regulation by the uk department of trade and industry with respect to the subsea and on land portions of the premier pipeline and the northern ireland director general  office for the regulation of electricity and gas with respect to the northern ireland portion of the premier pipeline and phoenix s operations generally 
the licenses establish mechanisms for the establishment of rates for the conveyance and transportation of natural gas  and generally may not be revoked except upon long term notice 
charges for the supply of gas by phoenix are largely unregulated unless a determination is made of an absence of competition 
keyspan s assets in canada are subject to regulation by canadian federal and provincial authorities 
such regulatory authorities license various aspects of the facilities and pipeline systems as well as regulate safety  operational and environmental matters and certain changes in such facilities and pipelines capacities and operations 
risks related to our business we are a holding company  and we and our subsidiaries are subject to federal and or state regulation which limits our financial activities  including the ability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends and make distributions to us we are a holding company registered under puhca with no business operations or sources of income of our own 
we conduct all of our operations through our subsidiaries and depend on the earnings and cash flow of  and dividends or distributions from  our subsidiaries to provide the funds necessary to meet our debt and contractual obligations and to pay dividends on our common stock 
because we are a registered holding company  our corporate and financial activities and those of our subsidiaries  including their ability to pay dividends to us from unearned surplus  are subject to puhca and regulation by the sec 
in addition  a substantial portion of our consolidated assets  earnings and cash flow is derived from the operation of our regulated utility subsidiaries  whose legal authority to pay dividends or make other distributions to us is subject to regulation by the utility regulatory commissions of new york  massachusetts and new hampshire 
pursuant to new york public service commission orders  the ability of keyspan energy delivery new york  or kedny  and keyspan energy delivery long island  or kedli  to pay dividends to us is conditioned upon their maintenance of a utility capital structure with debt not exceeding and  respectively  of total utility capitalization 
in addition  the level of dividends paid by both utilities may not be increased from current levels if a basis point penalty is incurred under a customer service performance program 
at the end of kedny s and kedli s rate years september  and november   respectively  their ratios of debt to total utility capitalization were in compliance with the ratios set forth above 
puhca also limits our business operations and our ability to affiliate with other utilities puhca  in addition to limiting our financial activities  also limits our operations to a single integrated utility system  plus additional energy related businesses  regulates transactions between us and our subsidiaries and requires sec approval for specified utility mergers and acquisitions 
in its order approving our acquisition of eastern enterprises and energynorth  inc  the sec reserved jurisdiction on its determination of whether the companies that comprise our energy services business can be classified as energy related companies and therefore retainable under existing sec precedent 
we are unable to predict whether the sec will authorize the retention of all or some of these companies or the impact its determination will have on our financial condition or results of operations 
the sec is currently conducting a routine audit of our operations to determine compliance with puhca  and while no issues have been brought to our attention that we believe to be material  we can provide no assurances as to the ultimate findings of the audit or their potential impact on our operations 
our gas distribution and electric services businesses may be adversely affected by changes in federal and state regulation the regulatory environment applicable to our gas distribution and our electric services businesses has undergone substantial changes in recent years  on both the federal and state levels 
these changes have significantly affected the nature of the gas and electric utility and power industries and the manner in which their participants conduct their businesses 
moreover  existing statutes and regulations may be revised or reinterpreted  new laws and regulations may be adopted or become applicable to us or our facilities  and future changes in laws and regulations may affect our gas distribution and our electric services businesses in ways that we cannot predict 
in addition  our operations are subject to extensive government regulation and require numerous permits  approvals and certificates from various federal  state and local governmental agencies 
some of our revenues in our gas distribution and electric services segments are directly dependent on rates established by federal or state regulatory authorities  and any change in these rates and regulatory structure could significantly impact our financial results 
increases in utility costs other than gas  not otherwise offset by increases in revenues or reductions in other expenses  could have an adverse effect on earnings due to the time lag associated with obtaining regulatory approval to recover such increased costs and expenses  and the uncertainty of whether regulatory commissions will allow full recovery of and return on such increased costs and expenses 
proposals to re regulate the wholesale power market have been made at the federal level 
these proposals  and legislative and other attention to the electric power industry could have a material adverse effect on our strategies and results of operations for our electric services business and our financial condition 
in particular  we sell power and energy from our ravenswood generating facility into the new york independent system operator  or nyiso  energy market at market based rates  subject to mitigation measures approved by the federal energy regulatory commission  or ferc 
the pricing for both energy sales and services to the nyiso energy market is still evolving and some of the ferc s price mitigation measures are subject to rehearing and possible judicial review 
our risk mitigation techniques such as hedging and purchase of insurance may not adequately provide protection to lower our financial exposure related to commodity price fluctuations  our marketing  trading and risk management operations routinely enter into contracts to hedge a portion of our purchase and sale commitments  weather fluctuations  electricity sales  natural gas supply and other commodities 
however  we do not always cover the entire exposure of our assets or our positions to market price volatility and the coverage will vary over time 
to the extent we have unhedged positions or our hedging procedures do not work as planned  fluctuating commodity prices could cause our sales and net income to be volatile 
our business is subject to many hazards from which our insurance may not adequately provide coverage 
therefore it is possible that our insurance may not be adequate to cover all losses or liabilities that we might incur in our operations 
unexpected outage of ravenswood  especially in the significant summer period  could materially impact our financial results 
damage to pipelines  equipment  properties and people caused by natural disasters  accidents  terrorism or other damage by third parties could exceed our insurance coverage 
although we do have insurance to protect against many of these contingent liabilities  this insurance is capped at certain levels  has self insured retentions and does not provide coverage for all liabilities 
sec rules for exploration and production companies may require us to recognize a non cash impairment charge at the end of our reporting periods we use the full cost method of accounting for our investments in natural gas and oil properties 
these investments consist of our approximately equity interest in the houston exploration company  an independent natural gas and oil exploration company  as well as keyspan exploration and production  llc  our wholly owned subsidiary engaged in a joint venture with houston exploration 
under the full cost method  all costs of acquisition  exploration and development of natural gas and oil reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool as incurred  and properties in the pool are depleted and charged to operations using the unit of production method based on production and proved reserve quantities 
to the extent that these capitalized costs  net of accumulated depletion  less deferred taxes exceed the present value using a discount rate of estimated future net cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves and the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  those excess costs are charged to operations 
if a write down is required  it would result in a charge to earnings but would not have an impact on cash flows 
once incurred  an impairment of gas properties is not reversible at a later date  even if gas prices increase 
you may not be able to seek remedies against arthur andersen llp  our former independent accountant  with respect to our financial statements that were audited by arthur andersen on june   arthur andersen llp  our former independent certified public accountant  was convicted of federal obstruction of justice arising from the government s investigation of enron corp 
on april   we dismissed arthur andersen and appointed deloitte touche llp to serve as our independent certified public accountant for fiscal year arthur andersen had audited our financial statements for the fiscal years ended december  and december  holders of our common stock may have no effective remedy against arthur andersen in connection with a material misstatement or omission in those financial statements  particularly in the event that arthur andersen ceases to exist or becomes insolvent as a result of the conviction or other proceedings against it 
our operating results may fluctuate on a seasonal and quarterly basis our gas distribution business is a seasonal business and is subject to weather conditions 
we receive most of our gas distribution revenues in the first and fourth quarters when demand for natural gas usually increases due to colder weather conditions 
as a result  we are subject to seasonal variations in working capital because we purchase most of our natural gas supplies in the second and third quarters and must increase our borrowings in these periods to finance these purchases 
accordingly  our results of operations in the future will fluctuate substantially on a seasonal basis 
in addition  our new england based gas distribution subsidiaries do not benefit from weather normalization tariffs  and results from our ravenswood generating facility are directly correlated to the weather as the demand and price for the electricity it generates increases during the summer 
as a result  fluctuations in weather between years may have a significant effect on our results of operations for these subsidiaries 
we cannot predict whether lipa will exercise its option to purchase our long island generating assets and the effect of that purchase on us under a generation purchase right agreement  as amended  entered into with the long island power authority  lipa has the right to purchase  at fair market value  during the six month period beginning november   all of our long island based generating assets that had been previously owned by the long island lighting company 
at this point in time  we cannot predict whether lipa will exercise its right to purchase the assets  nor can we estimate the effect on our financial condition or results of operations if lipa were to exercise its option 
a substantial portion of our revenues are derived from our agreements with lipa  and no assurances can be made that these arrangements will not be discontinued at some point in the future we derive a substantial portion of our revenues in our electric services segment from a series of agreements with lipa pursuant to which we manage lipa s transmission and distribution system and supply the majority of lipa s customers electricity needs 
the agreements terminate at various dates between may  and may  and at this time we can provide no assurance that any of the agreements will be renewed or extended or  if they were to be renewed or extended  as to the terms and conditions thereof 
we own approximately of the houston exploration company  and our results of operation are therefore subject to the risks affecting its business we own approximately of the houston exploration company  an independent natural gas and oil producer 
therefore  our results of operations in our energy investments segment are subject to the same risks and uncertainties that affect the operations of houston exploration 
in addition to the risks set forth under the caption sec rules for exploration and production companies may require us to recognize a non cash impairment charge at the end of our reporting periods  these risks and uncertainties include the volatility of natural gas and oil prices 
if natural gas and oil prices decline  the amount of natural gas and oil houston exploration can economically produce may be reduced  which may result in a material decline in its revenue 
the potential inability of houston exploration to meet its capital requirements 
if houston exploration is unable to meet its capital requirements to fund  develop  acquire and produce natural gas and oil reserves  its oil and gas reserves will decline 
substantial indebtedness 
houston exploration s outstanding indebtedness under its bank credit facility and the indenture governing its senior subordinated notes contain covenants that require a substantial portion of its cash flow from operations to be dedicated to its debt service obligations and impose other restrictions that limit its ability to borrow additional funds or dispose of assets 
these restrictions may affect its flexibility in planning for  and reacting to  changes in business conditions 
estimates of proved reserves and future net revenue may change 
any significant variance from the assumptions used to estimate proved reserves or natural gas could result in the actual quantity of houston exploration s reserves and future net cash flow being materially different from the estimates in its reserve report 
a decline or an otherwise negative change in the ratings or outlook on our securities could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to secure additional financing on favorable terms the rating agencies that rate our securities regularly review our financial condition and results of operations 
we can provide no assurances that the ratings or outlook on our securities will not be reduced or otherwise negatively changed 
a negative change in the ratings or outlook on our securities could have a materially adverse impact on our ability to secure additional financing on favorable terms 
our costs of compliance with environmental laws are significant  and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws could adversely affect us our operations are subject to extensive federal  state and local environmental laws and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources and the health and safety of our employees 
these environmental laws and regulations expose us to costs and liabilities relating to our operations and our current and formerly owned properties 
compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring  installation of pollution control equipment and permits at our facilities 
costs of compliance with environmental regulations  and in particular emission regulations  could have a material impact on our electric services business and our results of operations and financial position  especially if emission limits are tightened  more extensive permitting requirements are imposed  additional substances become regulated or the number and type of electric generating plants we operate increase 
in addition  we are responsible for the clean up of contamination at certain manufactured gas plant mgp sites and at other sites and are aware of additional mgp sites where we may have responsibility for clean up costs 
while our gas rate plans generally allow for the full recovery of the costs of investigation and remediation of mgp sites  these rate recovery mechanisms may change in the future 
to the extent rate recovery mechanisms change in the future  or if additional environmental matters arise in the future at our currently or historically owned facilities  at sites we may acquire in the future or at third party waste disposal sites  costs associated with investigating and remediating these sites could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
our businesses are subject to competition and general economic conditions impacting demand for services ravenswood  our merchant generation plant  in our electric services segment  is subject to competition that could adversely impact the market price for the electricity it produces 
construction of new transmission facilities could also cause significant changes to the market 
if generation and or transmission facilities are constructed  and or the availability of our ravenswood facility deteriorates  then the capacity and energy sales volumes could be adversely affected 
we cannot predict  however  when or if new power plants or transmission facilities will be built or the nature of the future new york city energy requirements 
competition facing our unregulated energy services businesses  including but not limited to competition from other mechanical  plumbing  heating  ventilation and air conditioning  and engineering companies  as well as  other utilities and utility holding companies that are permitted to engage in such activities  could adversely impact our financial results and the value of those businesses  resulting in decreased earnings as well as writedowns of the carrying value of those businesses 
in addition  competition in the fiber optics business could negatively impact the value of this business 
our gas distribution segment faces competition with distributors of alternative fuels and forms of energy  including fuel oil and propane 
our ability to continue to add new gas distribution customers may significantly impact financial results 
the gas distribution industry has experienced a decrease in consumption per customer over time partially due to increased efficiency of customers appliances 
our gas distribution segment is dependent upon the ability to add new customers to our system in a cost effective manner 
while our long island and new england utilities have significant growth potential  we cannot be sure new customers will continue to offset the decrease in consumption of our existing customer base 
there are a number of factors outside of our control that impact whether a potential customer converts from an alternative fuel to gas  including general economic factors impacting customers willingness to invest in new gas equipment 
employee matters as of december   keyspan and its wholly owned subsidiaries had approximately  employees 
of that total  approximately  employees in our regulated companies are covered under collective bargaining agreements 
keyspan has not experienced any work stoppage during the past five years and considers its relationship with employees  including those covered by collective bargaining agreements  to be good

in january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard sfas goodwill and other intangible assets 
the key requirements of this statement include the discontinuance of goodwill amortization  a revised framework for testing goodwill impairment and new criteria for the identification of intangible assets 
consolidated goodwill amortization for was million  or per share  and million  or per share for during  we recorded the effects of a number of events that impacted results of operations for that year 
these events are as follows we incurred losses attributed to the former roy kay companies of million after tax  or per share  primarily reflecting costs related to the discontinuance of the general contracting activities of these companies  costs to complete work on certain loss construction projects  and operating losses incurred 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  roy kay operations and note contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies legal matters  for a further discussion of these issues  our gas exploration and production subsidiaries recorded a non cash impairment charge to recognize the effect of lower wellhead prices on their valuation of proved gas reserves 
our share of this charge was million after tax  or per share 
see note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies  item f for further details  and following a favorable appellate court ruling  we reversed a previously recorded loss provision regarding certain pending rate refund issues relating to the rico class action settlement of million after tax  or per share 
this adjustment has been reflected as a million reduction to operations and maintenance expense and a reduction of million to interest charges on the consolidated statement of income for the year ended december  see note to the consolidated financial statements class action settlement for a further discussion of this issue 
interest expense decreased by million million after tax  or per share in compared to the weighted average interest rate on outstanding commercial paper for was approximately compared to approximately for last year 
further  keyspan had a number of interest rate swap agreements which effectively converted fixed rate debt to floating rate debt 
the use of these derivative instruments reduced interest expense by million in see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments  and fair values for a description of these instruments 
interest expense in also reflects the reversal of million in accrued interest expense resulting from the rico class action settlement 
net income from gas exploration and production operations decreased by million  or per share  in compared to these operations were adversely impacted by significantly lower realized gas prices in  particularly in the first quarter 
as previously mentioned  these operations recorded a non cash impairment charge in  excluding this charge  the comparative decrease in earnings was million  or per share 
income tax expense generally reflects the level of pre tax income for all periods reported 
further  during the year we finalized the valuation study related to the assets transferred to keyspan resulting from the keyspan long island lighting company lilco business combination completed in may as a result  an adjustment to deferred taxes of million was recorded to reflect a decrease in the tax basis of the assets acquired 
concurrent with this adjustment  keyspan reduced current income taxes payable by million  resulting in a million income tax benefit 
income tax expense also reflects additional tax benefits of approximately million resulting from the finalization of amended tax returns and the reversal of certain tax reserves 
average common shares outstanding in increased by compared to reflecting the re issuance of shares held in treasury pursuant to dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans 
this increase in average common shares outstanding reduced earnings per share in by compared to in january  we received net proceeds of approximately million from the issuance of million shares of common stock 
see the discussion under the caption capital expenditures and financing for further information on this equity offering 
earnings before interest and taxes ebit increased by million in compared to last year 
comparative ebit results were impacted by the items mentioned above  namely  i the discontinuation of goodwill amortization in of million  ii ebit losses of million incurred by the roy kay companies in compared to losses of million incurred in  iii the recording of a non cash pre tax impairment charge of million in to recognize the effect of lower wellhead prices  and iv the reversal  in  of a previously recorded loss provision relating to the rico class action settlement of million 
offsetting these benefits to comparative ebit results was a decrease in ebit in from gas exploration and production operations resulting from a significant decline in average realized gas prices 
see review of operating segments and note to the consolidated financial statements business segments for a detailed discussion of ebit results for each of our lines of business 
earnings from continuing operations less preferred stock dividends for the year ended december  decreased by million  or per share  compared to the same period in these comparative results were primarily driven by the items recorded in that were previously discussed 
further  on november  we acquired all of the common stock of eastern enterprises eastern and energynorth inc eni in a transaction accounted for as a purchase 
as a result  comparisons in consolidated earnings  revenues and expenses between fiscal years and have been significantly affected by the addition of these operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies 
as part of this transaction  in we recorded a million pre tax charge associated with early retirement and severance programs that were implemented upon the completion of the acquisitions 
the after tax effect of this charge on consolidated results was million  or per share 
interest expense increased by million  or in compared to  reflecting higher levels of debt outstanding  primarily related to i billion of long term debt and million of commercial paper issued to finance the acquisition of eastern and eni  ii debt assumed in the eastern and eni acquisition  iii million of notes issued during the year  primarily used to repay short term debt  iv debt incurred by keyspan canada  one of our canadian subsidiaries  as well as v higher commercial paper borrowings during the year to satisfy seasonal working capital needs 
as mentioned  we reversed million of previously recorded interest expense relating to the rico class action settlement during  of which million was recorded in income tax expense in generally reflects the lower level of pre tax income compared to see note to the consolidated financial statements  income taxes for more information 
the decrease in preferred stock dividends in compared to resulted from the redemption  at maturity  of million shares of preferred stock in the second quarter of average common shares outstanding in increased by compared to reflecting the re issuance of shares held in treasury pursuant to dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans 
this increase in average common shares outstanding reduced earnings per share in by compared to ebit from continuing operations in  after adjusting for the matters noted above  were substantially higher than such earnings for our gas distribution operations benefited from the addition of the new england gas utilities for the entire year in compared to only two months in  as well as from an increase in net margins due to continued gas sales growth  and cost saving synergies 
further  our gas exploration and production activities benefited from the combined effect of higher realized gas prices  primarily during the first quarter of  and improved production volumes throughout the year 
these benefits to ebit from continuing operations were almost entirely offset by higher interest expense 
in addition  during certain charges were incurred by our corporate and administrative areas that were not incurred in  which resulted in a significant increase to comparative earnings 
see the discussion under the heading review of operating segments for an analysis of comparative ebit for each of our operating segments 
on january   we announced that we had entered into an agreement to sell midland enterprises  llc midland  keyspan s inland marine barge business acquired in connection with the eastern acquisition 
in anticipation of this divestiture  which was completed on july   midland s operations have been reported as discontinued for all periods 
see note to the consolidated financial statements discontinued operations for further disclosure on the sale of midland 
in the fourth quarter of  an estimated loss on the sale of midland  as well as an estimate for midland s results of operations for the first six months of was recorded 
as a result of a change in the tax structure of this transaction  an additional after tax loss of million was recorded in  primarily reflecting a provision for certain city and state taxes 
financial outlook for consistent with our prior earnings guidance  and as reaffirmed in february following the announcement regarding the sale of a portion of our ownership in the houston exploration company houston exploration  our gas exploration and production subsidiary as further discussed below  keyspan s earnings for are forecasted to be approximately to per share  after giving effect to the sale of million shares of common stock previously noted 
earnings from continuing core operations defined for this purpose as all continuing operations other than gas exploration and production  less preferred stock dividends are forecasted to be approximately to per share  while earnings from gas exploration and production operations are forecasted to be approximately to per share 
the earnings forecast may vary significantly during the year due to  among other things  changing energy market and weather conditions 
it should be noted that  starting in  keyspan will expense stock options granted to its employees in order to reflect all prospective compensation costs in earnings 
consolidated earnings are seasonal in nature due to the significant contribution to earnings of our gas distribution operations 
as a result  we expect to earn most of our annual earnings in the first and fourth quarters of our fiscal year and breakeven or marginally profitable earnings are anticipated to be achieved in the second and third quarters of our fiscal year 
review of operating segments the following discussion of financial results achieved by our operating segments is presented on an ebit basis 
we use ebit measures in our financial and business planning process to provide a reasonable assurance that our financial forecasts will provide  among other things  i shareholders with a competitive return on their investment  ii adequate earnings and cash flow to service debt  and iii adequate interest coverage to maintain or improve our credit ratings 
information concerning ebit is presented as a measure of those financial results 
ebit should not be construed as an alternative to net income or cash flow from operating activities as determined by generally accepted accounting principles

four natural gas distribution companies boston gas company  essex gas company  colonial gas company and energynorth natural gas  inc  each doing business under the name keyspan energy delivery new england kedne  provide gas distribution service to customers in massachusetts and new hampshire

a therm reflects the heating content of approximately cubic feet of gas 
one billion cubic feet bcf of gas equals approximately  mdth 
net revenues combined net gas revenues revenues less the cost of gas sold and associated revenue taxes from our gas distribution operations increased by million  or 
both the new york and new england based gas distribution operations were adversely impacted by the significantly warmer than normal weather experienced throughout the northeastern united states during  particularly during the first quarter 
based on heating degree days  weather for the twelve months ended december  was approximately warmer than normal and approximately colder than last year in the new york and new england service territories 
however  weather during the heating season  january march  was approximately warmer than normal  across our service territories 
our gas distribution operations historically earn approximately of yearly ebit during the january march period 
during  kedny and kedli  together  added approximately million in gross gas load additions 
the increased gas sales were generated from oil to gas space heating conversions  as well as from new construction 
these load additions  however  were offset by declining usage per customer due to the extremely warm first quarter weather and the use of more efficient gas heating equipment 
additionally  the down turn in the economy throughout the northeastern united states had an adverse impact on gas consumption in as a result of these factors  net revenues from firm gas customers residential  commercial and industrial customers in our new york service territory decreased by million in compared to last year 
included in net revenues are regulatory incentives that contributed a favorable million to comparative net revenues 
net revenues from firm gas customers in the new england service territory increased by million in compared to last year  primarily as a result of approximately million in gross gas load additions 
also included in net revenues are base rate adjustments totaling million associated with boston gas company s performance based rate plan pbr 
the largest component of this adjustment reflects the beneficial effect of a favorable ruling of the massachusetts supreme judicial court relating to the accumulated inefficiencies component of the productivity factor in the pbr 
this ruling resulted in a benefit to comparative net margins of million 
see regulation and rate matters for a further discussion of this matter 
offsetting  to some extent  these benefits to revenues are the adverse effects of declining usage per customer due to the extremely warm first quarter weather and the use of more efficient gas heating equipment 
additionally  the down turn in the economy throughout the northeastern united states had an adverse impact on gas consumption in kedny and kedli each operate under utility tariffs that contain a weather normalization adjustment that significantly offsets variations in firm net revenues due to fluctuations in weather 
these weather normalization adjustments resulted in an increase to net gas revenues of million in  but this did not fully mitigate the impact of the loss in revenues due to the extremely warm weather experienced during the first quarter 
the new england based gas distribution subsidiaries do not have weather normalization adjustments 
to lessen  to some extent  the effect of fluctuations in normal weather patterns on kedne s results of operations and cash flows  weather derivatives are in place for the winter heating season 
since weather during the fourth quarter of was colder than normal in the new england service territory  we recorded a million reduction to revenues to reflect the loss on these derivative transactions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments  and fair values for further information 
firm gas distribution rates in  excluding gas cost recoveries  have remained substantially unchanged from last year in all of our service territories 
total net gas revenues increased by million or in compared to the gas distribution operations of kedne added million to this increase  while our new york based gas distribution operations accounted for the remaining million increase 
net revenues from our firm gas customers increased by million in compared to this increase was largely driven by the addition of kedne s gas distribution operations which accounted for million of the increase 
our new york based gas distribution operations added million to firm net revenues in through the addition of new gas customers and through our continuing efforts to convert residential and commercial customers from oil to gas for space heating purposes  primarily on long island 
in addition  the comparative increase in firm net revenues in was favorably affected by the recovery of previously deferred property taxes  as well as regulatory incentives that added million and million  respectively  to the increase in firm net gas revenues in the related property tax expense is being amortized through operating taxes and therefore does not benefit ebit 
in our large volume heating and other interruptible non firm markets  which include large apartment houses  government buildings and schools  gas service is provided under rates that are established to compete with prices of alternative fuel  including no 
and no 
grade heating oil 
net margins realized from these customers in are comparable to such margins realized last year 
net revenues in these markets in were slightly lower than sales to this market for the majority of these margins earned by kedne and kedli are returned to firm customers as an offset to gas costs 
we are committed to our expansion strategies initiated during the past few years 
we believe that significant growth opportunities exist on long island and in the new england service territories 
we estimate that on long island approximately of the residential and multi family markets  and approximately of the commercial market currently use natural gas for space heating purposes 
further  we estimate that in the new england service territories approximately of the residential and multi family markets  and approximately of the commercial market currently use natural gas for space heating purposes 
we will continue to seek growth in all of our market segments through the expansion of the gas distribution system  as well as through the conversion of residential homes from oil to gas for space heating purposes and the pursuit of opportunities to grow multi family  industrial and commercial markets 
firm sales  transportation and other quantities total actual firm gas sales and transportation quantities remained consistent with last year 
in the new york service territory  actual and weather normalized firm gas sales and transportation quantities decreased slightly in compared to in the new england services territories  firm gas sales and transportation quantities increased  despite the warm first quarter weather  due to load additions 
firm gas sales and transportation quantities increased by during  compared to the gas distribution operations of kedne  accounted for mdth  or of the increase 
firm gas sales and transportation quantities from our new york based gas distribution operations decreased by compared to as a result of warmer than normal weather 
weather was approximately warmer than normal in and approximately warmer than the prior year 
weather normalized sales quantities in in our new york service territories were flat compared to due primarily to the adverse effect on consumption of extraordinarily high gas prices during the first quarter of net revenues are not affected by customers choosing to purchase their gas supply from other sources  since delivery rates charged to transportation customers generally are the same as the delivery component of rates charged to full sales service customers 
transportation quantities related to electric generation reflect the transportation of gas to keyspan s electric generating facilities located on long island 
net revenues from these services are not material 
other sales quantities include on system interruptible quantities  off system sales quantities sales made to customers outside of our service territories and related transportation 
we have an agreement with coral resources  lp coral  a subsidiary of shell oil company  under which coral assists in the origination  structuring  valuation and execution of energy related transactions on behalf of kedny and kedli 
we also had a portfolio management contract with el paso energy marketing  inc el paso  under which el paso provided all of the city gate supply requirements at market prices and managed certain upstream capacity  underground storage and term supply contracts for kedne 
our agreement with el paso expired on october  and our agreement with coral expires on march  we have negotiated a new agreement with entergy koch to replace the expired el paso agreement 
the new agreement with entergy koch began on november  and extends through march  in anticipation of the expiration of the existing agreements  a request for proposal was sent to various portfolio managers 
upon evaluation of the bids  keyspan will negotiate agreements for all of its gas distribution subsidiaries 
it is anticipated that such agreements will become effective april  purchased gas for resale the decrease in gas costs in compared to of million  or  reflects a decrease of in the price per dekatherm of gas purchased  and a increase in the quantity of gas purchased 
the increase in gas costs in compared to of million  or primarily reflects the addition of kedne s operations for an entire year 
kedne s operations accounted for million of the increase 
fluctuations in utility gas costs associated with firm gas customers have no impact on operating results 
the current gas rate structure of each of our gas distribution utilities includes a gas adjustment clause  pursuant to which variations between actual gas costs incurred and gas costs billed are deferred and refunded to or collected from customers in a subsequent period 
operating expenses operating expenses decreased by million in compared to last year 
comparative operating expenses were significantly impacted by the discontinuation of goodwill amortization 
as previously mentioned  in january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas goodwill and other intangible assets  which required  among other things  the discontinuation of goodwill amortization 
goodwill amortization in the gas distribution segment for the twelve months ended december  was million 
excluding the effects of this amortization  operating expenses increased by million  or  in compared to last year 
the increase in operating expense in is attributable  in part  to higher pension and other postretirement benefits which increased by approximately million  net of amounts deferred and subject to regulatory true ups  over the level incurred in the cost of these benefits has risen primarily as a result of lower actual returns on plan assets  as well as an increase in health care costs 
further  depreciation and amortization expense  excluding the goodwill amortization  has also increased as a result of the continued expansion of the gas distribution system 
offsetting  to some extent  the increases in expenses noted above is a favorable million adjustment to operating taxes recorded in related to the reversal of certain operating tax reserves established for the keyspan lilco transaction and subsequent re organization in may further  we are realizing cost saving synergies as a result of early retirement and severance programs implemented in the fourth quarter of the early retirement portion of the program was completed in  but the severance feature continued through operating expenses increased by million  or  in compared to  due to the addition of the new england gas distribution operations  which added million to operating expenses in this amount includes operations and maintenance costs of million  depreciation and amortization charges of million and general taxes of million 
operating expenses related to our new york based gas distribution operations decreased in compared to  as a result of cost savings synergies realized in and lower general and administrative costs being allocated to our new york operations as a result of a change in of the allocation methodology for these costs pursuant to the securities and exchange commission s sec requirements under puhca 
further  in we recorded a charge of million associated with early retirement and severance programs implemented upon the acquisition of eastern and eni 
depreciation and amortization expense in reflects million for the amortization of goodwill as previously noted  as well as continued property additions  and the amortization of certain costs that were previously deferred and were recovered through gas rates in other matters as previously mentioned  there remain significant growth opportunities in our long island and new england gas distribution service areas 
the northeast region represents a significant portion of the country s population and energy consumption 
gas sales growth and customer additions are critical to our earnings in the future 
however  the beneficial effect of our growth initiatives may not be fully realized in the short term since we will continue to make incremental investments in our gas distribution network and expand our promotional campaigns to optimize the long term growth opportunities in our service territories 
to take advantage of the anticipated gas sales growth opportunities in our new york service territory  in we formed the islander east pipeline  llc islander east  a limited liability company in which a keyspan subsidiary and a subsidiary of duke energy corporation each own a equity interest 
during  islander east received a certificate of public convenience and necessity from the federal energy regulatory commission ferc to construct  own and operate a natural gas pipeline facility consisting of approximately miles of interstate natural gas pipeline extending from algonquin gas transmission company s facilities in connecticut  across the long island sound and connecting with kedli s facilities on long island 
islander east has obtained all required permits in new york state for the construction of the facility 
however  the state of connecticut has issued a moratorium on the issuance of the permits relating to the construction of energy projects until june islander east has therefore been unable to obtain the necessary permits from the state of connecticut at this time 
islander east has also appealed a denial by the state of connecticut of the coastal zone management permit to the us department of commerce and such appeal is currently pending 
assuming the timely receipt of approvals from the state of connecticut  the islander east pipeline is expected to begin operating by year end and will transport  dth daily to the long island and new york city energy markets  enough fuel to heat  homes  as well as allow us to further diversify the geographic sources of our gas supply 
we are currently evaluating various options for the financing of this pipeline 
see the discussion under capital expenditures and financing for more information on our financing plans for on december   we acquired algonquin lng  lp  the owner and operator of a  barrel ferc regulated liquefied natural gas lng storage and receiving facility in providence  rhode island  from duke energy for approximately million 
algonquin lng was renamed keyspan lng  lp and its largest customer is boston gas company  which contracts for more than half of the facility s storage capacity 
electric services the electric services segment primarily consists of subsidiaries that own and operate oil and gas fired electric generating plants in the borough of queens the ravenswood facility and the counties of nassau and suffolk on long island 
in addition  through long term contracts of varying lengths  we manage the electric transmission and distribution t d system  the fuel and electric purchases  and the off system electric sales for lipa 
selected financial data for the electric services segment is set forth in the table below for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars revenues    purchased fuel    net revenues    operating expenses operations and maintenance    depreciation    operating taxes    total operating expenses    operating income    other income and deductions  net    earnings before interest charges and income taxes    electric sales mwh    capacity mw    cooling degree days    reflects the operations of the ravenswood facility only 
net revenues total electric net revenues increased by million for the twelve months ended december   compared to the same period in net revenues in reflect net revenues of million from our new glenwood landing and port jefferson electric peaking facilities located on long island 
the glenwood facility was placed in service on june   while the port jefferson facility was placed in service on july  these facilities add a combined megawatts of generating capacity to keyspan s electric generation portfolio 
the capacity of and energy produced by these facilities are dedicated to lipa under year contracts 
net revenues from the lipa agreements increased by million or in  compared to last year 
included in revenues for  are billings to lipa for certain third party costs that were significantly higher than such billings last year 
these revenues have minimal impact on earnings since we record a similar amount of costs in operating expense and we share any cost under runs with lipa 
excluding these third party billings  revenues for associated with the lipa agreements were comparable to such revenues last year 
in addition  in we earned million associated with non cost performance incentives provided for under these agreements  compared to million earned last year 
for a description of the lipa agreements  see lipa agreements 
net revenues from the ravenswood facility were million  or  lower in  compared to net revenues from capacity sales decreased compared to last year  while margins associated with the sale of electric energy were basically flat 
comparative energy sales benefited from a increase in the megawatt hours sold as a result of the hot summer weather offset  in part  by a reduction in spark spread the selling price of electricity less cost of fuel 
measured in cooling degree days  weather during the cooling season was approximately warmer than last year 
the decrease in net revenues from capacity sales in  was due  in part  to more competitive pricing by the electric generators that bid into the new york independent system operator nyiso energy market which lowered capacity clearing prices by approximately compared to last year 
further  the nyiso revised its methodology employed to determine the available supply of and demand for installed capacity that also had an adverse impact on the capacity market by reducing the capacity required to be purchased by load serving entities such as electric utilities 
however  in september  the nyiso recognized a flaw in its revised methodology 
since this flaw resulted in insufficient capacity being procured by the market  it was identified as a reliability concern 
the nyiso corrected its methodology prior to the recent winter auction to ensure sufficient capacity is procured 
elimination of the flaw ensures compliance with new york state reliability rules 
the ravenswood facility and the nyiso energy market should benefit from this correction since  as a result  load serving entities should procure sufficient capacity to maintain reliability for customers 
the rules and regulations for capacity  energy sales and the sale of certain ancillary services to the nyiso energy markets continue to evolve and the ferc has adopted several price mitigation measures that have adversely impacted earnings from the ravenswood facility 
certain of these mitigation measures are still subject to rehearing and possible judicial review 
the final resolution of these issues and their effect on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows cannot be fully determined at this time 
see discussion under market and credit risk management activities for a further discussion of these matters 
total electric net revenues increased slightly in compared to net revenues from the ravenswood facility decreased by million  or  reflecting lower realized energy prices and lower ancillary service revenues offset  in part  by effective hedging strategies 
ancillary services include primarily spinning reserves and non spinning reserves available to replace energy that is unable to be delivered due to the unexpected loss of a major energy source 
further  capacity and energy sales quantities  as well as realized energy prices were adversely impacted by an increase in available capacity in new york city during revenues from the service agreements with lipa increased by million  or in compared to included in revenues in were billings to lipa for certain third party capital costs that were significantly higher than such billings in primarily due to the construction of an underground transmission line to reinforce the electric system capacity on the south fork of long island 
as noted previously  these revenues had a minimal impact on net income 
excluding the third party billings  revenues in associated with the lipa agreements were comparable to such revenues earned during the prior year 
in addition  in we earned million associated with non cost performance incentives provided for under these agreements  compared to million earned in operating expenses operating expenses in were consistent with the prior year 
however  included in comparative operating expenses is an increase in third party capital costs that are fully recoverable from lipa  as noted previously 
excluding the increase in these costs  operating expenses have decreased by approximately million in compared to in addition to third party capital costs  lipa reimburses keyspan for costs directly incurred by keyspan in providing service to lipa  subject to the sharing provisions in the lipa agreements 
these reimbursements are based on predetermined estimates of operating costs 
variations between certain actual operating costs incurred ie postretirement costs and property taxes and the predetermined estimates are deferred and refunded to or collected from lipa in subsequent periods 
as a result of an adjustment related to this true up  certain pension and other postretirement costs were approximately million lower in compared to further  during  we settled certain outstanding issues with lipa and the consolidated edison company of new york  inc consolidated edison that resulted in a million decrease to comparative operating expenses 
the increase in depreciation and amortization expense  as indicated in the above table  primarily reflects depreciation associated with the two new electric peaking facilities 
operating expenses increased by million  or in  compared to  primarily as a result of the increase in third party costs previously noted and higher allocated charges for corporate and administrative costs due to changes in our allocation methodology as prescribed under puhca 
other income and deductions the increases in other income in and are due primarily to inter company interest income earned by subsidiaries within the electric services segment 
for the most part  the various subsidiaries of keyspan do not maintain separate cash balances 
rather  liquid assets are maintained in a money pool  from and to which subsidiaries can either borrow or lend 
inter company interest expense is charged to borrowers  while inter company interest income is earned by lenders 
in all years presented in the above table  the subsidiaries within the electric services segment have been net lenders to the money pool and  accordingly  have earned inter company interest income 
interest rates associated with money pool borrowings are generally the same as keyspan s short term borrowing rate 
all inter company interest income and expense is eliminated for consolidated financial reporting purposes 
other matters as previously mentioned  both the glenwood landing and port jefferson electric generating peaking facilities are fully operational 
short term financing was used for the construction of these facilities  but various financing options to permanently finance these facilities are being explored 
see the discussion under capital expenditures and financing for more information on our financing plans for further  construction has begun on a new mw combined cycle generating facility at the ravenswood facility site 
the new facility is expected to commence operations in late the capacity and energy produced from this plant are anticipated to be sold into the nyiso energy markets 
we are also progressing through the siting process before the new york state board on electric generation siting and the environment with a proposal to build a similar mw combined cycle electric generating facility on long island 
on february   an examiners recommended decision was issued recommending the granting of a certificate of environmental capability and public need for this proposed facility 
in addition  as part of our growth strategy  we continually evaluate the possible acquisition of additional generating facilities in the northeast 
however  we are unable to predict when or if any such facilities will be acquired and the effect any such acquired facilities will have on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
under the generation purchase right agreement gpra  lipa had the right for a one year period  beginning on may   to acquire all of our long island based generating assets formerly owned by lilco at fair market value at the time of the exercise of such right 
by agreement dated march   lipa and keyspan amended the gpra to provide for a new six month option period ending on may  the other terms of the option reflected in the gpra remain unchanged 
see the discussion under the heading electric services revenue mechanisms  generation purchase right agreement for further details 
in late  lipa announced  and we acknowledged  that during and we had made errors in reporting lipa s electric system requirements  resulting in an overestimation of lipa s unbilled revenue 
lipa and keyspan have continued to review and audit the reporting of electric system requirements for and earlier periods  and have determined that  in addition to the and overestimation  unbilled revenues for prior periods back to may were slightly underestimated 
based upon the review  the total overestimation in unbilled revenues amounted to approximately million 
the lipa revenue estimation error did not have an impact on lipa s electric rates charged to its customers nor to its cash balances 
we do not believe that the lipa revenue estimation error will have any material adverse impact on the various agreements with lipa or on our financial or operating performance 
energy services the energy services segment primarily includes companies that provide services through three lines of business to clients located within the new york city metropolitan area  including new jersey and connecticut  as well as in rhode island  pennsylvania  massachusetts and new hampshire 
the lines of business are home energy services  business solutions  and fiber optic services 
the table below highlights selected financial information for the energy services segment 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars revenues    less cost of gas and fuel    net revenues    other operating expenses    operating income loss    other income and deductions  net    earnings loss before interest charges and income taxes    comparative ebit results for compared to were significantly impacted by losses incurred by one of our subsidiaries 
in  we discontinued the general contracting activities related to the former roy kay companies  with the exception of completion of work on then existing contracts  based upon our view that the general contracting business is not a core competency of these companies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements roy kay operations for a more detailed discussion 
for the year ended december   we incurred an ebit loss of million associated with the operations of the former roy kay companies 
the roy kay ebit results reflect costs related to the discontinuation of the general contracting activities of these companies  costs to complete work on certain loss construction projects  and operating losses 
we are completing the contracts entered into by the former roy kay companies and  for the twelve months ended december   we incurred ebit losses of million reflecting increases in the estimates of and costs to complete these contracts  and general and administrative expenses 
excluding the results of the former roy kay companies  the energy services segment reflected an increase in ebit of million in compared to last year 
revenues  excluding the roy kay companies  decreased by million in  while the cost of fuel decreased by million 
these declines  which for the most part offset each other  reflect the operations of our gas and electric marketing subsidiary 
in  this subsidiary began to focus its marketing efforts on higher net margin customers and as a result has substantially decreased its customer base 
ebit results for the business solutions group of companies  which provide mechanical contracting  plumbing  engineering and consulting services to commercial  institutional  and industrial customers  improved by million in compared to this increase reflects additional work being performed on the backlog of projects existing at year end last year and the absence of million in losses incurred on four major projects in a backlog of approximately million presently exists  which is below the december  level 
offsetting the positive contribution to ebit by the business solutions group of companies  was a decrease of million associated with the home energy services group of companies 
these companies provide residential and small commercial customers with service and maintenance of appliances  as well as the retail marketing of natural gas and electricity 
contributing to the decrease in ebit from home energy services were the following factors i the continued adverse impact of the down turn in the economy  ii the non renewal of appliance service contracts due to the warm first quarter weather  iii costs associated with the closing of a service center  and iv an increase in the reserve for bad debts 
comparative ebit results in benefited from the elimination of goodwill amortization  which for amounted to million 
we continue to re align and or combine a number of our service centers in this segment in order to reduce operating and general and administrative costs  realize synergy savings and improve profitability 
excluding the operations of the roy kay companies  ebit for this segment was million lower in compared to  reflecting costs incurred to complete certain loss construction contracts and higher corporate allocated costs as a result of puhca requirements see securities and exchange commission regulation for further discussion 
energy investments the energy investment segment consists of our gas exploration and production operations  certain other domestic and international energy related investments  as well as certain technology related investments 
our gas exploration and production subsidiaries are engaged in gas and oil exploration and production  and the development and acquisition of domestic natural gas and oil properties 
at december   these investments consisted of our ownership interest in houston exploration  as well as our wholly owned subsidiary  keyspan exploration and production  llc 
in line with our strategy of exploring the monetization or divesture of certain non core assets  in october we monetized a portion of our assets in the joint venture drilling program with houston exploration that was initiated in we received million in cash from houston exploration for bcfe of estimated proved and probable reserves 
the proceeds were used to pay down short term debt  there was no earnings impact from this transaction 
further  in february  we reduced our ownership interest in houston exploration to approximately through the repurchase  by houston exploration  of million shares of common stock owned by keyspan 
the net proceeds of approximately million received in connection with this repurchase were used to pay down short term debt 
this segment also consists of keyspan canada  our interest in the iroquois gas transmission system lp iroquois  and our interest in premier transmission limited and interest in phoenix natural gas limited  both located in northern ireland 
selected financial data and operating statistics for our gas exploration and production activities is set forth in the following table for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars revenues    depletion and amortization expense    full cost ceiling test write down  other operating expenses    operating income    other income and deductions  net    earnings before interest charges and income taxes    natural gas and oil production mmcf    natural gas per mcf realized natural gas per mcf unhedged operating income above represents of our gas exploration and production subsidiaries results for the periods indicated 
earnings before interest and taxes  however  is adjusted to reflect minority interest 
earnings before interest and taxes the decrease in ebit of million in compared to last year  reflects a reduction in average realized gas prices average wellhead price received for production including hedging gains and losses  which lowered comparative revenues  as well as an increase in operating expenses associated with higher levels of production and a higher depletion rate 
the adverse effect on revenues resulting from the decline in average realized gas prices was partially offset by an increase of in production volumes 
the average realized gas price for was of the average unhedged natural gas price  resulting in revenues that were million higher than revenues that would have been achieved if derivative financial instruments had not been in place during houston exploration hedged approximately of its production  principally through the use of costless collars 
the average realized gas price for was of the average unhedged natural gas price  resulting in revenues that were million higher than revenues that would have been achieved if derivative financial instruments had not been employed during these derivative instruments are designed to provide houston exploration with a more predictable cash flow  as well as to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in natural gas prices 
at december  houston exploration had derivative positions in place to hedge approximately of its estimated production and approximately of its estimated production  again principally through the use of costless collars 
depending upon market conditions  houston exploration may enter into additional derivative positions during to hedge a larger portion of its estimated production 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  hedging  derivative financial instruments  and fair value for further information 
the depreciation  depletion and amortization rate was per mcf for the twelve months ended december   compared to per mcf for the same period in  reflecting higher finding and development costs together with the addition of fewer new reserves 
in  our gas exploration and production subsidiaries recorded a non cash impairment charge of million to recognize the effect of lower wellhead prices on their valuation of proved gas reserves 
our share of this charge  which includes our joint venture ownership interest and minority interest  was million after tax 
excluding this charge  the comparative decrease in ebit for compared to would have been greater 
see note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies  item f for more information on this charge 
the increase in ebit for compared to reflects a significant increase in gas exploration and production revenues  partially offset by an increase in operating expenses associated with higher production volumes 
revenues for benefited from the combined effect of a increase in production volumes and a increase in average realized gas prices 
as noted above  ebit results also reflect the recording of a non cash impairment charge to recognize the effect of lower wellhead prices on the valuation of proved gas reserves 
as previously mentioned  the average realized gas price in was of the average unhedged natural gas price  resulting in revenues that were million higher than revenues that would have been achieved if derivative financial instruments had not been employed during the average realized gas price in was of the average unhedged natural gas price  resulting in revenues that were million lower than revenues that would have been achieved if derivative financial instruments had not been in place during natural gas prices continue to be volatile and the risk that we may be required to record an impairment charge on our full cost pool again in the future increases when natural gas prices are depressed or if we have significant downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves 
the table below indicates the net proved reserves of our gas exploration and production subsidiaries for the periods indicated 
year ended december  bcfe bcfe bcfe houston exploration kse e p total selected financial data for our other energy related investments is set forth in the following table for the periods indicated 
year ended december  in thousands of dollars revenues    operation and maintenance expense    other operating expenses    operating income    other income and deductions  net    earnings before interest charges and income taxes    the increase in ebit in compared to last year primarily reflects lower comparative losses associated with certain technology related investments 
further  higher ebit from our northern ireland investments were  for the most part  offset by lower ebit realized by keyspan canada 
keyspan canada experienced lower per unit sales prices  as well as lower quantities of sales of natural gas liquids in  as a result of generally lower oil prices 
the pricing of natural gas liquids is directly related to oil prices 
overall  ebit from these operations and investments in remained relatively constant compared to ebit growth from our investments in keyspan canada  northern ireland and certain operations purchased as part of our acquisition of eastern were offset  in part  by losses incurred from certain technology related investments 
further  in the fourth quarter of  we acquired the remaining interest in keyspan canada  making us the sole owner 
results of operations associated with keyspan canada have been fully consolidated since the additional investment  whereas prior to this transaction  keyspan canada s results were reported as equity income in other income and deductions 
we do not consider certain businesses contained in the energy investments segment to be part of our core asset group 
we have stated in the past that we may sell or otherwise dispose of all or a portion of our non core assets 
based on current market conditions  we cannot predict when  or if  any such sale or disposition may take place  or the effect that any such sale or disposition may have on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
allocated costs as previously mentioned  we are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec under puhca 
as part of the regulatory provisions of puhca  the sec regulates various transactions among affiliates within a holding company system 
in accordance with the regulations of puhca and the new york state public service commission requirements  we have service companies that provide i traditional corporate and administrative services  ii gas and electric transmission and distribution systems planning  marketing  and gas supply planning and procurement  and iii engineering and surveying services to subsidiaries 
revised allocation methodologies  approved by the sec  have been in use since to allocate certain service company costs to affiliates 
these non operating subsidiaries incurred certain costs in primarily related to general corporate expenses that were not allocated to the various operating subsidiaries 
these expenses combined with inter company money pool eliminations that were higher in compared to resulted in an ebit loss of million in in  these non operating subsidiaries realized ebit of million  primarily related to the million benefit associated with the favorable appellate court decision regarding the rico class action settlement  previously mentioned 
during  certain costs were incurred by our corporate and administrative subsidiaries that were not allocated to other operating segments  and were not incurred in these unallocated costs had a significant effect on comparative ebit results between the two years and are as follows i a charge of million for a contribution to the keyspan foundation a not for profit philanthropic foundation that makes donations to local charitable community organizations  ii an impairment charge of million associated with our equity investment in certain technology related activities  iii branding expenses and other costs related to the integration of the eastern and eni companies of million  and iv early retirement and severance charges of million 
item i is reflected in other income and deductions and all other items are reflected in operations and maintenance expense in the consolidated statement of income for further  during we i recorded the benefit associated with the favorable appellate court decision regarding the rico class action settlement at our corporate holding company level  as mentioned previously  which increased ebit by million  and ii settled certain outstanding issues associated with lipa and reallocated certain administrative costs which combined added million to ebit 
the net result of the preceding items contributed to the increase in ebit of million in associated with our non operating subsidiaries 
liquidity cash flow from operations decreased by million  or  in compared to operating cash flow from gas exploration and production activities was adversely impacted by significantly lower realized gas prices in further  cash flow from operations in reflects the funding of the minimum pension obligation related to our new england subsidiaries of million 
these adverse effects on cash flow were partially offset by the termination of two interest rate swap agreements that resulted in a favorable operating cash flow benefit of approximately million  as well as lower income tax payments 
state and federal tax payments were lower in  compared to last year  as keyspan is currently in a refund position with regard to such taxes 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  hedging  derivative financial instruments  and fair value for an explanation of the interest rate hedges 
cash flow from operations for reflects strong results from gas distribution and electric operations  as well as significant contributions from gas exploration and production activities 
further  the decrease in natural gas prices in the second half of also had a positive impact on cash flow from operations 
as a result of the seasonal nature of gas distribution operations  we incur significant cash expenditures during the summer and early fall to purchase and inject gas into our storage facilities 
we recover these costs in subsequent periods as the gas is removed from storage and delivered to our customers  primarily during the winter  for space heating purposes 
significant cash flows are generated during the first two quarters of the subsequent fiscal year as we receive payment from customers for such heating season use 
due to the significant increase in gas prices during the summer and early fall of  gas cost recoveries for the first two quarters of were greater than such recoveries for the same period in further  gas prices during the third and fourth quarters of were lower than the prior year  resulting in lower cash expenditures required to maintain natural gas inventory in storage 
also  as stated earlier  gas exploration and production activities benefited from higher gas prices during the first two quarters of compared to these enhancements to cash flow were partially offset by an increase in interest payments due to higher levels of outstanding debt 
a substantial portion of consolidated revenues are derived from the operations of businesses within the electric services segment  that are largely dependent upon two large customers lipa and the nyiso 
accordingly  our cash flows are dependent upon the timely payment of amounts owed to us by these customers 
in  keyspan renewed its existing day revolving credit agreement with a commercial bank syndicate of banks totaling billion  a reduction from the previous billion facility 
the credit facility is used to back up the billion commercial paper program 
the fees for the facility are subject to a ratings based grid  with an annual fee of 
on the total amount of the revolving facility 
the credit agreement allows for keyspan to borrow using several different types of loans  specifically  eurodollar loans  adjustable bank rate abr loans  or competitively bid loans 
eurodollar loans are based on the eurodollar rate plus a margin of basis points for loans up to of the facility  and an additional basis points for loans over of the total facility 
abr loans are based on the greater of the prime rate  the base cd rate plus  or the federal funds effective rate plus 
competitive bid loans are based on bid results requested by keyspan from the lenders 
we do not anticipate borrowing against this facility  however  if the credit rating on our commercial paper program were to be downgraded  it may be necessary to do so 
the credit facility contains certain affirmative and negative operating covenants  including restrictions on keyspan s ability to mortgage  pledge  encumber or otherwise subject its property to any lien  as well as certain financial covenants that require us to  among other things  maintain a consolidated indebtedness to consolidated capitalization ratio of no more than  a decrease from the ratio required under the previous credit facility 
under the terms of the credit facility  keyspan s debt to total capitalization ratio reflects equity treatment for the meds equity units issued in may in addition  the million ravenswood master lease is treated as debt 
at december   consolidated indebtedness  as calculated under the terms of the credit facility  was of consolidated capitalization 
this ratio was reduced to by the sale of million shares of common stock in january as discussed below 
violation of this covenant could result in the termination of the credit facility and the required repayment of amounts borrowed thereunder  as well as possible cross defaults under other debt agreements 
see discussion under capital expenditures and financing for an explanation of the meds equity units and the ravenswood master lease 
the credit facility also requires that net cash proceeds from the sale of significant subsidiaries be applied to reduce consolidated indebtedness 
further  an acceleration of indebtedness of keyspan or one of its subsidiaries for borrowed money in excess of million in the aggregate  if not annulled within days after written notice  would create an event of default under the indenture dated november   between keyspan corporation and the jpmorganchase bank as trustee 
at december   keyspan was in compliance with all covenants 
at december   we had cash and temporary cash investments of million 
during  we repaid million of commercial paper and  at december   million of commercial paper was outstanding at a weighted average annualized interest rate of 
we had the ability to borrow up to an additional million at december  under the commercial paper program 
during  houston exploration entered into a new revolving credit facility with a commercial banking syndicate that replaced the previous million revolving credit facility 
the new facility provides houston exploration with an initial commitment of million  which can be increased at its option to a maximum of million with prior approval from the banking syndicate 
the new credit facility is subject to borrowing base limitations  initially set at million and will be re determined semi annually 
up to million of the borrowing base is available for the issuance of letters of credit 
the new credit facility matures on july   is unsecured and ranks senior to all existing debt of houston exploration 
under the houston exploration credit facility  interest on base rate loans is payable at a fluctuating rate  or base rate  equal to the sum of a the greater of the federal funds rate plus or the bank s prime rate plus b a variable margin between and  depending on the amount of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
interest on fixed loans is payable at a fixed rate equal to the sum of a a quoted reserve adjusted libor rate  plus b a variable margin between and  depending on the amount of borrowings outstanding under the credit facility 
financial covenants require houston exploration to  among other things  i maintain an interest coverage ratio of at least to of earnings before interest  taxes and depreciation ebitda to cash interest  ii maintain a total debt to ebitda ratio of not more than to  and iii hedge no more than of natural gas production during any month period 
at december   houston exploration was in compliance with all financial covenants 
during  houston exploration borrowed million under its credit facility and repaid million 
at december   million of borrowings remained outstanding at a weighted average annualized interest rate of 
also  million was committed under outstanding letters of credit obligations 
at december   million of borrowing capacity was available 
keyspan canada has two revolving credit facilities with financial institutions in canada 
repayments under these agreements totaled approximately us million during at december   approximately us million was outstanding at a weighted average annualized interest rate of 
keyspan canada currently has available borrowings of approximately us million 
these revolving credit agreements have been extended through january an event of default would exist under these credit facilities if keyspan  as guarantor on the facilities  falls below investment grade rating or falls below a or a at a time when its consolidated indebtedness  as measured using the same criteria employed under keyspan s credit facility  is greater than of consolidated capitalization or its cash flow to interest expense is less than to 
at december   keyspan and keyspan canada were in compliance with all covenants 
on january   keyspan sold million shares of common stock to the open market and realized net proceeds of approximately million 
all shares were offered by keyspan pursuant to the effective shelf registration statement filed with the sec 
net proceeds from the equity sale were used initially to pay down commercial paper and reduced our debt to capitalization ratio by approximately basis points 
consolidated indebtedness at december   as calculated under the terms of keyspan s credit facility and  adjusted for this equity offering was of consolidated capitalization 
in addition  as previously noted  we used the net proceeds of approximately million received in february in connection with the partial monetization of houston exploration to repay short term debt 
the anticipated impact of additional common shares outstanding due to the equity offering offset by the expected interest savings from the repayments of commercial paper is anticipated to result in dilution of approximately per share in in connection with the keyspan lilco transaction  keyspan and certain of its subsidiaries issued promissory notes to lipa to support certain debt obligations assumed by lipa 
at december  the remaining principal amount of promissory notes issued to lipa was approximately million 
in an effort to mitigate the dilutive effect of the equity issuance  in february  keyspan notified lipa of its intention to redeem approximately million aggregate principal amount of such promissory notes at the applicable redemption prices plus accrued and unpaid interest through the dates of redemption 
it is anticipated that such redemption will take place before the end of the first quarter of under these promissory notes  keyspan is required to obtain letters of credit to secure its payment obligations if its long term debt is not rated at least in the a range by at least two nationally recognized statistical rating agencies 
the ratings on our long term debt have remained unchanged since december  the following table represents the ratings of our long term debt at december  currently  these ratings are all on stable outlook with the exception of standard poor s rating on keyspan which is on negative outlook 
moody s investor services standard and poor s fitchratings keyspan corporation a a a kedny a a a kedli a a a boston gas a a na colonial gas a a na we satisfy our seasonal working capital requirements primarily through internally generated funds and the issuance of commercial paper 
we believe that these sources of funds are sufficient to meet our seasonal working capital needs 
in addition  we currently use treasury stock to satisfy the requirements of our dividend reinvestment and employee benefit plans 
capital expenditures and financing construction expenditures the table below sets forth our construction expenditures by operating segment for the periods indicated year ended december  in thousands of dollars gas distribution   electric services   energy investments   energy services   corporate unallocated   construction expenditures related to the gas distribution segment are primarily for the renewal and replacement of mains and services and for the expansion of the gas distribution system 
construction expenditures for the electric services segment reflect costs to i maintain our generating facilities  ii expand the ravenswood facility  and iii construct the new long island generating facilities as previously noted 
construction expenditures related to the energy investments segment primarily reflect costs associated with gas exploration and production activities 
these costs are related to the exploration and development of properties primarily in southern louisiana and in the gulf of mexico 
expenditures also include development costs associated with the joint venture with houston exploration  as well as costs related to keyspan canada s gas processing facilities 
at december   total expenditures associated with the siting  permitting and construction of the ravenswood expansion project  the siting  permitting and procurement of equipment for the long island mw combined cycle generation plant  and the siting and permitting of the islander east pipeline project were million 
construction expenditures for are estimated to be billion  including estimated expenditures for the construction of the new electric generating facilities 
the amount of future construction expenditures is reviewed on an ongoing basis and can be affected by timing  scope and changes in investment opportunities 
financing at december   keyspan had authorization under puhca to issue up to billion of securities and had an existing billion shelf registration statement on file with the sec  with million available for issuance 
in february  we filed a new shelf registration statement for the issuance of an additional billion of securities  thereby giving us the ability to issue up to billion of debt  equity or various forms of preferred stock 
in may  we issued million of meds equity units at consisting of a three year forward purchase contract for our common stock and a six year note 
the purchase contract commits us three years from the date of issuance of the meds equity units to issue and the investors to purchase a number of shares of our common stock based on a formula tied to the market price of our common stock at that time 
the coupon is composed of interest payments on the six year note of and premium payments on the three year equity forward contract of 
these instruments have been recorded as long term debt on our consolidated balance sheet  but rating agencies  as well as our credit facility  consider between to of the instruments as equity for purposes of calculating debt to total capitalization ratios 
see note to the consolidated financial statements long term debt for further details on the meds equity units 
the issuance of the meds equity units utilized million of our financing authority under both the shelf registration and the puhca financing authority 
both the million six year note and the million forward equity contract are considered current issuances for these purposes 
on december  the sec issued an order increasing the available financing authority under puhca to an aggregate million 
following the recent common stock offering previously mentioned and shares expected to be issued for employee benefit and dividend reinvestment plans  we have approximately million available for the issuance of new securities under our current puhca authorization 
however  the issuance of securities in connection with the redemption of existing securities including the promissory notes discussed previously is permitted under our puhca authorization notwithstanding the foregoing limit 
we intend to seek authorization to issue additional securities in the near term 
in may  colonial gas company repaid million of its series a first mortgage medium term notes 
these notes would have matured on may   but the holder of the notes elected to exercise a put option to redeem the notes early 
as previously noted  we issued commercial paper to finance the construction of our two long island peaking power plants  and we will continue to finance the construction of the new mw combined cycle generating facility at the ravenswood facility site  as well as the islander east pipeline  through the issuance of commercial paper 
during  we intend to issue approximately million of either taxable or tax exempt long term debt securities  the proceeds of which  it is anticipated  will be used to re pay the outstanding commercial paper related to the construction of our two long island peaking power plants 
we also may issue an additional to million of medium term or long term debt in to refinance existing indebtedness 
we will continue to evaluate our capital structure and financing strategy for and beyond 
we believe that our current sources of funding ie  internally generated funds  the issuance of additional securities as noted above  and the availability of commercial paper  together with the cash proceeds from the recent equity offering  are sufficient to meet our anticipated working capital needs for the foreseeable future 
off balance sheet arrangements guarantees keyspan has fully and unconditionally guaranteed million of medium term notes issued by kedli under kedli s current shelf registration  as well as a us million revolving credit agreement associated with keyspan canada 
both the medium term notes and outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement are reflected on the consolidated balance sheet 
further  at december  keyspan has guaranteed i million of surety bonds associated with certain construction projects currently being performed by subsidiaries within the energy services segment  ii certain supply contracts  margin accounts and purchase orders for certain subsidiaries in the aggregate amount of million  iii the obligations of keyspan ravenswood llc  the lessee under the million master lease agreement associated with the ravenswood facility  and iv million of subsidiary letters of credit 
keyspan has also guaranteed million associated with a non affiliated company s line of credit 
these guarantees are not recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
the guarantee of the kedli medium term notes expires in  while the other guarantees have terms that do not extend beyond  however the master lease agreement can be extended to at this time  we have no reason to believe that our subsidiaries will default on their current obligations 
however  we cannot predict when or if any defaults may take place or the impact such defaults may have on our consolidated results of operations  financial condition or cash flows 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies for a description of the leasing arrangement associated with the ravenswood master lease agreement and additional information regarding keyspan s guarantees 
variable interest entity we have an arrangement with a variable interest entity through which we lease a portion of the ravenswood facility 
we acquired the ravenswood facility  in part  through the variable interest entity from consolidated edison on june  for approximately million 
in order to reduce the initial cash requirements  we entered into a lease agreement the master lease with a variable interest  unaffiliated financing entity that acquired a portion of the facility  or three steam generating units  directly from consolidated edison and leased it to a keyspan subsidiary 
the variable interest unaffiliated financing entity acquired the property for million  financed with debt of million of capitalization and equity of million of capitalization 
monthly lease payments equal the monthly interest expense on the debt securities 
the master lease currently qualifies as an operating lease for financial reporting purposes while preserving our ownership of the facility for federal and state income tax purposes 
the initial term of the master lease expires on june  and may be extended until june  in june  we have the right to either purchase the facility at the original acquisition cost of million plus the present value of the lease payments that would otherwise have been paid through june   or terminate the master lease and dispose of the facility 
if the master lease is terminated  keyspan has guaranteed an amount equal to of the original acquisition cost plus the present value of the lease payments that would have otherwise been paid through june  in june  when the master lease terminates  we may purchase the facility in an amount equal to the original acquisition cost  subject to adjustments  or surrender the facility to the lessor 
if we elect not to purchase the facility  the lessor will sell the property  we have guaranteed the lessor of the original acquisition cost 
in january  the financial accounting standards board the board issued interpretation no 
fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 

this interpretation would require us to  among other things  consolidate this variable interest entity for the first interim period ending after june   so long as the current variable interest structure remains intact 
this interpretation will require us to classify the master lease as debt on the consolidated balance sheet at an amount generally equal to fair market value 
as previously mentioned  under the terms of our credit facility the master lease is considered debt in the ratio of debt to total capitalization and therefore  implementation of fin will have no impact on our credit facility 
further  we will be required to record an asset on the consolidated balance sheet for an amount equal to the fair market value of the leased assets 
however  such amount cannot exceed the amount of debt to be recorded for the variable interest entity 
at this time  we believe that the fair market value of the leased assets is in excess of the original acquisition cost 
the interpretation contains certain other provisions that we will be required to implement in and such provisions may impact future earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies for additional information on the master lease and interpretation no

contractual obligations keyspan has certain contractual obligations related to its outstanding long term debt  outstanding credit facility borrowings  outstanding commercial paper borrowings  operating and capital leases  and demand charges associated with certain commodity purchases 
keyspan s outstanding short term and long term debt issuances are explained in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements long term debt 
keyspan s operating and capital leases  as well as its demand charges are more fully detailed in note to the consolidated financial statements contractual obligations  financial guarantees and contingencies 
the table below reflects maturity schedules for keyspan s contractual obligations at december  in thousands of dollars contractual obligations total years years after years long term debt     capital leases     operating leases     demand charges   total contractual cash obligations     commercial paper  revolving discussion of critical accounting policies and assumptions in preparing our financial statements  the application of certain accounting policies requires difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
the circumstances that make these judgments difficult  subjective and or complex have to do with the need to make estimates about the impact of matters that are inherently uncertain 
actual effects on our financial position and results of operations may vary significantly from expected results if the judgments and assumptions underlying the estimates prove to be inaccurate 
the critical accounting policies requiring such subjectivity are discussed below 
percentage of completion percentage of completion accounting is the prescribed method of accounting for long term construction type contracts in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles and  accordingly  the method used for revenue recognition by the energy services segment 
percentage of completion is measured principally by comparing the percentage of costs incurred to date for each contract to the estimated total costs for each contract at completion 
provisions for estimated losses on uncompleted contracts are made in the period in which such losses are determined 
application of percentage of completion accounting results in the recognition of costs and estimated earnings in excess of billings on uncompleted contracts recorded within the consolidated balance sheet which arise when revenues have been recognized but the amounts cannot be billed under the terms of the contracts 
such amounts are recoverable from customers based on various measures of performance  including achievement of certain milestones  completion of specified units or completion of the contract 
due to uncertainties inherent within estimates employed to apply percentage of completion accounting  it is possible that estimates will be revised as project work progresses 
changes in estimates resulting in additional future costs to complete projects can result in reduced margins or loss contracts 
application of percentage of completion accounting requires that the impact of those revised estimates be reported in the consolidated financial statements prospectively 
valuation of goodwill keyspan records goodwill on purchase transactions  representing the excess of acquisition cost over the fair value of net assets acquired 
in testing for goodwill impairment under sfas  significant reliance is placed upon estimated future cash flows requiring broad assumptions and significant judgment by management 
cash flow estimates are determined based upon future commodity prices  customer rates  customer demand  operating costs  rate relief from regulators  customer growth and other items 
a change in the fair value of our investments could cause a significant change in the carrying value of goodwill 
while we believe that our assumptions are reasonable  actual results may differ from our projections 
the assumptions used to measure the fair value of our investments are the same as those used by us to prepare yearly operating segment and consolidated earnings and cash flow forecasts 
in addition  these assumptions are used to set yearly budgetary guidelines 
under sfas  goodwill is deemed impaired if the fair value of the reporting unit s assets is less than the carrying value of those assets including goodwill 
it was determined that keyspan s financial reporting segments are virtually the same as the reporting unit levels as defined in sfas for those segments with goodwill  the following amounts were evaluated using the standards set forth by sfas through december  in thousands of dollars reporting unit gas distribution  energy services  energy investments and other  total goodwill  the majority of the goodwill associated with the gas distribution unit resulted from the november acquisition of eastern and eni 
for purposes of determining goodwill impairment  the fair value of the entire gas distribution segment is evaluated against the carrying value of the entire unit 
some of the major factors that were considered in determining the fair value of the gas distribution unit included assumptions regarding the growth in revenues  earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation and amortization  and the weighted average cost of capital 
for the initial implementation of sfas  the fair value of each of the reporting units exceeded the carrying value and no impairment charge was necessary 
the fair value for the reporting units was evaluated based on the present value of anticipated cash flows 
as permitted under sfas  we can rely on our previous valuations for the annual impairment testing provided that the following criteria for each reporting unit are met a the assets and liabilities that make up the reporting unit have not changed significantly since the most recent fair value determination  and b the most recent fair value determination resulted in an amount that exceeded the carrying amount of the reporting unit by a substantial margin 
in the case of the gas distribution and the energy investments segment  the above criteria have been met and no further evaluation was required 
in regard to the energy services segment  criteria b was not met since the initial fair value valuation did not exceed the carrying value by an amount deemed by us to be substantial 
however  our annual test was performed in the fourth quarter of which verified that no impairment charge was deemed necessary 
keyspan will continue to monitor the goodwill associated with this reporting unit 
accounting for the effects of rate regulation on gas distribution operations the financial statements of the gas distribution segment reflect the ratemaking policies and orders of the nypsc  the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc  and the massachusetts department of telecommunications and energy dte 
four of our six regulated gas utilities kedny  kedli  boston gas company and energynorth natural gas  inc are subject to the provisions of sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement recognizes the actions of regulators  through the ratemaking process  to create future economic benefits and obligations affecting rate regulated companies 
in separate merger related orders issued by the dte  the base rates charged by colonial gas company and essex gas company have been frozen at their current levels for a ten year period ending due to the length of these base rate freezes  the colonial and essex gas companies had previously discontinued the application of sfas sfas allows for the deferral of expenses and income on the consolidated balance sheet as regulatory assets and liabilities when it is probable that those expenses and income will be allowed in the rate setting process in a period different from the period in which they would have been reflected in the consolidated statements of income of an unregulated company 
these deferred regulatory assets and liabilities are then recognized in the consolidated statement of income in the period in which the amounts are reflected in rates 
rate regulation is undergoing significant change as regulators and customers seek lower prices for utility service and greater competition among energy service providers 
in the event that regulation significantly changes the opportunity for us to recover costs in the future  all or a portion of our regulated operations may no longer meet the criteria for the application of sfas in that event  a write down of our existing regulatory assets and liabilities could result 
if we were unable to continue to apply the provisions of sfas for any of our rate regulated subsidiaries  we would apply the provisions of sfas regulated enterprises accounting for the discontinuation of application of fasb statement no 
we estimate that the write off of all our net regulatory assets at december  could result in a charge to net income of million or per share  which would be classified as an extraordinary item 
in management s opinion  our regulated subsidiaries that currently are subject to the provisions of sfas will continue to be subject to sfas for the foreseeable future 
as is further discussed under the caption regulation and rate matters  the rate plans previously in effect for kedny  kedli and boston gas company have all expired 
the continued application of sfas to record the activities of these subsidiaries is contingent upon the actions of regulators with regard to future rate plans 
we anticipate filing a base rate case and a performance based rate plan for boston gas company in the second quarter of further  we are currently evaluating various options that may be available to us including  but not limited to  proposing new plans for kedny and kedli 
the ultimate resolution of any future rate plans could have a significant impact on the application of sfas to these entities and  accordingly  on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
however  management believes that currently available facts support the continued application of sfas and that all regulatory assets and liabilities are recoverable or refundable through the regulatory environment 
pension and other postretirement benefits as discussed in note of the consolidated financial statements  postretirement benefits  keyspan participates in both non contributory defined benefit pension plans  as well as other post retirement benefit opeb plans collectively postretirement plans 
keyspan s reported costs of providing pension and opeb benefits are dependent upon numerous factors resulting from actual plan experience and assumptions of future experience 
pension and opeb costs collectively postretirement costs are impacted by actual employee demographics  the level of contributions made to the plans  earnings on plan assets  and health care cost trends 
changes made to the provisions of these plans may also impact current and future postretirement costs 
postretirement costs may also be significantly affected by changes in key actuarial assumptions  including  anticipated rates of return on plan assets and the discount rates used in determining the postretirement costs and benefit obligations 
the discount rate used for our postretirement benefits at december  was 
our discount rate assumption is based upon the current investment yield associated with rating agency indices that have high quality long term corporate bonds 
for  the assumed long term return on our postretirement plans assets was 
in selecting an assumed rate of return  we consider past performance and economic forecasts for the types of investments held by the plans 
the actual year compound rate of return  net of all expenses  for the keyspan postretirement plans are greater than 
in addition  in eight of the last years  actual returns have been greater than 
our postretirement plans assets presently consist of approximately equity  fixed income bonds and cash 
in an effort to maximize plan performance  actual asset allocation will fluctuate from year to year depending on the then current economic environment 
based upon the historical performance of equity investments over time  our asset allocation  and our investment strategy  the assumed long term rate of return appears reasonable 
our health care cost trend assumptions are developed based on historical cost data  the near term outlook and an assessment of likely long term trends 
the salary growth assumptions reflect our long term actual experience and future and near term outlook 
actual results that differ from our assumptions are accumulated and amortized over ten years 
certain gas distribution subsidiaries are subject to sfas  and  as a result  changes in postretirement expenses are deferred for future recovery from or refund to gas sales customers 
further  changes in postretirement expenses associated with subsidiaries that service the lipa agreements are also deferred for future recovery from or refund to lipa 
as a result of these deferrals  we estimate that the actual impact of postretirement expense to keyspan s consolidated statement of income is approximately of the otherwise actuarially determined expense 
the year end december  assumed discount rate used to determine postretirement obligations was 
a basis point increase or decrease in the assumed year end discount rate would have had no impact on expense 
however  a basis point decrease in the assumed year end discount rate would result in the recording of an additional minimum pension liability 
therefore  a year end discount rate of would have required an additional million debit to other comprehensive income oci  net of tax and deferrals noted previously 
a year end discount rate of would have reduced the charge to oci by a net million 
at january   the assumed discount rate used to determine postretirement obligations was 
a basis point increase or decrease in the assumed discount rate at the beginning of the year would have impacted expense by approximately million  net of tax and deferrals 
in  the expected rate of return on plan assets was 
a basis point increase or decrease in the return on plan assets would have impacted expense by approximately million  net of tax and deferrals 
historically  we have funded our pension plans in excess of the amount required to satisfy minimum erisa funding requirements 
at december   we had a funding balance in excess of the erisa minimum funding requirements and as a result keyspan will not be required to make any contribution to its pension plans in however  although we have presently exceeded erisa funding requirements  our pension plans  on an actuarial basis  are currently underfunded 
future funding requirements are heavily dependent on actual return on plan assets 
therefore  if the actual return on plan assets continues to be significantly below the expected returns  we may elect to fund the pension plans in full cost accounting our gas exploration and production subsidiaries use the full cost method to account for their natural gas and oil properties 
under full cost accounting  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration  and development of natural gas and oil reserves are capitalized into a full cost pool 
capitalized costs include costs of all unproved properties  internal costs directly related to natural gas and oil activities  and capitalized interest 
under full cost accounting rules  total capitalized costs are limited to a ceiling equal to the present value of future net revenues  discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties less income tax effects the ceiling limitation 
a quarterly ceiling test is performed to evaluate whether the net book value of the full cost pool exceeds the ceiling limitation 
if capitalized costs net of accumulated depreciation  depletion and amortization less deferred taxes are greater than the discounted future net revenues or ceiling limitation  a write down or impairment of the full cost pool is required 
a write down of the carrying value of the full cost pool is a non cash charge that reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and typically results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
once incurred  a write down is not reversible at a later date 
the ceiling test is calculated using natural gas and oil prices in effect as of the balance sheet date  held constant over the life of the reserves 
our gas exploration and production subsidiaries use derivative financial instruments that qualify for hedge accounting under sfas to hedge against the volatility of natural gas prices 
in accordance with current sec guidelines  these derivatives are included in the estimated future cash flows in the ceiling test calculation 
in calculating the ceiling test at december   our subsidiaries estimated that a full cost ceiling cushion existed  whereby the carrying value of the full cost pool was less that the ceiling limitation 
no writedown is required when a cushion exists 
natural gas prices continue to be volatile and the risk that a write down to the full cost pool will be required increases when natural gas prices are depressed or if there are significant downward revisions in estimated proved reserves 
natural gas and oil reserve quantities represent estimates only 
under full cost accounting  reserve estimates are used to determine the full cost ceiling limitation as well as the depletion rate 
houston exploration estimates its proved reserves and future net revenues using sales prices estimated to be in effect as of the date it makes the reserve estimates 
natural gas prices  which have fluctuated widely in recent years  affect estimated quantities of proved reserves and future net revenues 
any estimates of natural gas and oil reserves and their values are inherently uncertain  including many factors beyond our control 
the accuracy of any reserve estimate is a function of the quality of available data and of engineering and geological interpretation and judgment 
in addition  estimates of reserves may be revised based upon actual production  results of future development and exploration activities  prevailing natural gas and oil prices  operating costs and other factors  which revision may be material 
reserve estimates are highly dependent upon the accuracy of the underlying assumptions 
actual future production may be materially different from estimated reserve quantities and the differences could materially affect future amortization of natural gas and oil properties 
valuation of derivative instruments we employ derivative instruments to hedge a portion of our exposure to commodity price risk and interest rate risk  to partially hedge the cash flow variability associated with our electric energy and capacity sales from the ravenswood facility  as well as to economically hedge certain other commodity exposures 
in addition  keyspan canada has used swap instruments to lock in the purchase price on the purchase of electricity needed to operate its gas processing plants 
all of our derivative instruments  except for certain weather derivatives  meet the sfas definition of a derivative 
for those derivative instruments designated as cash flow hedges  changes in the market value of substantially all of our derivatives are recorded in other comprehensive income  in line with effectiveness measurements and are not recorded through earnings until the derivative positions are settled 
further  none of keyspan s derivative instruments qualify as energy trading contracts as defined by current accounting literature 
when available  quoted market prices are used to record a contract s fair value 
however  market values for certain derivative contracts may not be readily available or determinable 
a number of our commodity related derivative instruments are exchange traded and  accordingly  fair value measurements are generally based on standard new york mercantile exchange nymex quotes 
we use industry published indices  nyiso location zone indices  as well as other local published indices to value contracts for commodities that are not exchange traded  such as no 
grade fuel oil and electricity 
the fair value of our electric capacity hedges is based on published nyiso capacity bidding prices 
further  if no active market exists for a commodity  fair values may be based on pricing models 
for collar transactions relating to natural gas sales associated with our gas exploration and production subsidiaries  we use standard nymex quotes  and published volatility with black scholes valuations to calculate the fair value of these instruments 
all fair value measurements  whether calculated using standard nymex quotes or other valuation techniques  are subjective and subject to fluctuations in commodity prices  interest rates and overall economic market conditions and  as a result  our fair value measurements may not be precise and can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
the table below summarizes the sources of fair value for cash flow derivative instruments that qualify for hedge accounting treatment at december  in thousands of dollars fair value of contracts maturity maturity total source of fair value fair value prices actively quoted   prices provided by external sources prices based on models and other valuation methods    local published indices  during  we also had interest rate swap agreements in which approximately billion of fixed rate debt was effectively converted to floating rate debt 
the fair values of these derivative instruments were provided to us by our counter parties and represent the present value of estimated future cash flows based on a forward interest rate curve for the life of the derivative instrument 
additionally  we use derivative financial instruments to reduce cash flow variability associated with the purchase price for a portion of future natural gas purchases for our regulated gas distribution activities 
since these derivative instruments are employed to reduce variability of the purchase price of natural gas to be sold to regulated firm gas sales customers  the accounting for these derivative instruments is subject to sfas at december   these instruments had a fair value of million and were valued using  primarily  standard nymex quotes 
these derivative instruments will be settled in further  certain contracts for the physical purchase of natural gas for our regulated firm gas sales customers can no longer be exempted as normal purchases from the requirements of sfas at december   these contracts had a fair value of million 
the fair value for these contracts was determined using matrix pricing models based on contracts with similar terms and risks 
keyspan also has a small number of derivative financial instruments that meet the sfas definition of a derivative but do not qualify for hedge accounting treatment 
further  these instruments do not qualify as energy trading contracts as defined by current accounting literature 
we use nymex futures to economically hedge the cash flow variability associated with the purchase of fuel for a portion of our fleet vehicles 
keyspan canada has a portfolio of financially settled natural gas collars and natural gas liquid swap transactions 
finally  our retail gas and electric marketing subsidiary has bought options to economically hedge the cash flow variability associated with a portion of expected future natural gas purchases 
at december   these instruments  all of which expire in  had an unfavorable net mark to market value of million  which was recorded to earnings 
we use standard nymex quotes  local published commodity indices  and prices provided by external sources to value these instruments 
see note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments and fair values for a further description of all our derivative instruments 
dividends we are currently paying a dividend at an annual rate of per common share 
our dividend policy is reviewed annually by the board of directors 
the amount and timing of all dividend payments is subject to the discretion of the board of directors and will depend upon business conditions  results of operations  financial conditions and other factors 
based on currently foreseeable market conditions  we intend to maintain the dividend at the level 
pursuant to nypsc orders  the ability of kedny and kedli to pay dividends to keyspan is conditioned upon maintenance of a utility capital structure with debt not exceeding and  respectively  of total utility capitalization 
in addition  the level of dividends paid by both utilities may not be increased from current levels if a basis point penalty is incurred under the customer service performance program 
at the end of kedny s and kedli s rate years september  and november   respectively  the ratio of debt to total utility capitalization was and  respectively 
additionally  we have met the requisite customer service performance standards 
our corporate and financial activities and those of each of our subsidiaries including their ability to pay dividends to us are also subject to regulation by the sec 
for additional information  see the discussion under the heading securities and exchange commission regulation 
regulation and rate matters gas distribution by orders dated february  and april   the nypsc approved the keyspan lilco business combination and established gas rates for both kedny and kedli 
pursuant to the orders  billion of efficiency savings  excluding gas costs  attributable to operating synergies that are expected to be realized over the ten year period following the combination  were allocated to customers  net of transaction costs 
effective may   kedny s base rates to core customers were reduced by million annually 
in addition  kedny is subject to an earnings sharing provision pursuant to which it was required to credit core customers with of any utility earnings up to basis points above certain threshold return on equity levels over the term of the rate plan other than any earnings associated with discrete incentives and of any utility earnings in excess of basis points above such threshold levels 
the threshold level for the rate year ended september  was 
kedny slightly exceeded the threshold return on equity for the rate year ended september  on september   kedny s rate agreement with the nypsc expired 
under the terms of the agreement  the then current gas distribution rates and all other provisions  including the earnings sharing provision at the threshold level  remain in effect until changed by the nypsc 
at this time  we are currently evaluating various options that may be available to us regarding kedny s rates  including but not limited to  proposing a new rate plan 
the orders also required kedli to reduce base rates to its customers by million annually effective february  and by an additional million annually effective may  kedli is subject to an earnings sharing provision pursuant to which it is required to credit to firm customers of any utility earnings in any rate year up to basis points above a return on equity of and of any utility earnings in excess of a return on equity of 
kedli did not earn above its threshold return level in its rate year ended november  on november   kedli s rate agreement with the nypsc expired 
under the terms of the agreement  the gas distribution rates and all other provisions  including the earnings sharing provision  will remain in effect until changed by the nypsc 
at this time  we are currently evaluating various options that may be available to us regarding kedli s rate plan  including but not limited to  proposing a new rate plan 
we expect current gas distribution rates for kedny and kedli to remain in effect through boston gas company  colonial gas company and essex gas company operations are subject to massachusetts s statutes applicable to gas utilities 
rates for gas sales and transportation service  distribution safety practices  issuance of securities and affiliate transactions are regulated by the dte 
boston gas company s gas rates for local distribution service are governed by a five year performance based rate plan approved by the dte in the plan 
under the plan  boston gas company s rates for local distribution were recalculated annually to reflect inflation for the previous months  and reduced by a productivity factor of 
the productivity factor has been the subject of a remand proceeding at the dte 
with respect to this appeal  on march   the massachusetts supreme judicial court ruled in favor of boston gas company and reduced the productivity factor from to 
further  the plan contains a margin sharing mechanism  whereby of earnings in excess of a return on equity are passed back to customers 
similarly  ratepayers absorb of any shortfall below a return on equity 
the plan expired on october  on march   we filed notice  as required  with the dte that we may file a base rate case and a performance based rate plan for the boston gas company to replace the plan that expired on october  on may   we filed with the dte a request to extend the existing performance based rate plan for an additional term of one year 
this request was denied by the dte in early september as a result  we anticipate filing a base rate case and a performance based rate plan for the boston gas company in the second quarter of  to be effective in the fourth quarter of in connection with the eastern acquisition of colonial gas company in  the dte approved a merger and rate plan that resulted in a ten year freeze of base rates to colonial gas company s firm customers 
the base rate freeze is subject only to certain exogenous factors  such as changes in tax laws  accounting changes  or regulatory  judicial  or legislative changes 
the office of the attorney general appealed the dte s order to the supreme judicial court  which appeal is still pending 
due to the length of the base rate freeze  colonial gas company discontinued its application of sfas accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
essex gas company is also under a ten year base rate freeze and has also discontinued its application of sfas energynorth natural gas  inc s base rates continue as set by the nhpuc in securities and exchange commission regulation keyspan and its subsidiaries are subject to the jurisdiction of the sec under puhca 
the rules and regulations under puhca generally limit the operations of a registered holding company to a single integrated public utility system  plus additional energy related businesses 
in addition  the principal regulatory provisions of puhca i regulate certain transactions among affiliates within a holding company system including the payment of dividends by such subsidiaries to a holding company  ii govern the issuance  acquisition and disposition of securities and assets by a holding company and its subsidiaries  iii limit the entry by registered holding companies and their subsidiaries into businesses other than electric and or gas utility businesses  and iv require sec approval for certain utility mergers and acquisitions 
the sec s order issued on november   in connection with our acquisition of eastern and eni as amended on december  and february   provides us with  among other things  authorization to do the following through december  the authorization period a subject to an aggregate amount of billion  i maintain existing financing agreements  ii issue and sell up to billion of additional securities in compliance with certain defined parameters  iii issue additional guarantees and other forms of credit support in an aggregate amount of billion at any time in addition to any such securities  guarantees and credit support outstanding or existing as of november   and iv amend  renew  extend  supplement or replace any of the foregoing  b issue shares of common stock or reissue shares of common stock held in treasury under dividend reinvestment and stock based management incentive and employee benefit plans  c maintain existing and enter into additional hedging transactions with respect to outstanding indebtedness in order to manage and minimize interest rate costs  d invest up to billion in exempt wholesale generators  and e pay dividends out of capital and unearned surplus as well as paid in capital with respect to certain subsidiaries  subject to certain limitations 
in addition  we have committed that during the authorization period  our common equity will be at least of our consolidated capitalization and each of our utility subsidiaries common equity will be at least of such entity s capitalization 
at december  our consolidated common equity was of our consolidated capitalization  including commercial paper  and each of our utility subsidiaries common equity was at least of its respective capitalization 
electric services revenue mechanisms lipa agreements keyspan  through certain of its subsidiaries  provides services to lipa under the following agreements management services agreement msa a keyspan subsidiary manages the day to day operations  maintenance and capital improvements of the t d system 
lipa exercises control over the performance of the t d system through specific standards for performance and incentives 
in exchange for providing the services  we earn a million annual management fee and are operating under a contract  which provides certain incentives and imposes certain penalties based upon performance 
we have reached an agreement with lipa to extend the msa for months through  as discussed under the heading generation purchase right agreement below 
annual service incentives or penalties exist under the msa if certain targets are achieved or not achieved 
in addition  we can earn certain incentives for budget underruns associated with the day to day operations  maintenance and capital improvements of lipa s t d system 
these incentives provide for us to i retain on the first million in annual budget underruns  and ii retain of additional annual underruns up to of the total cost budget  thereafter all savings accrue to lipa 
with respect to cost overruns  we will absorb the first million of overruns  with a sharing of overruns above million 
there are certain limitations on the amount of cost sharing of overruns 
to date  we have performed our obligations under the msa within the agreed upon budget guidelines and we are committed to providing on going services to lipa within the established cost structure 
however  no assurances can be given as to future operating results under this agreement 
power supply agreement psa a keyspan subsidiary sells to lipa all of the capacity and  to the extent requested  energy conversion services from our existing long island based oil and gas fired generating plants 
sales of capacity and energy conversion services are made under rates approved by the ferc 
under the terms of the psa  rates will be reestablished for the contract year commencing january  by recalculating the revenue requirement underlying those rates 
we anticipate submitting to the ferc a rate filing reflecting the recalculated revenue requirement in the fall of we are unable to predict the outcome of that proceeding at this time 
rates charged to lipa include a fixed and variable component 
the variable component is billed to lipa on a monthly basis and is dependent on the number of megawatt hours dispatched 
lipa has no obligation to purchase energy conversion services from us and is able to purchase energy conversion services on a least cost basis from all available sources consistent with existing interconnection limitations of the t d system 
the psa provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for the maintenance of the output capability and the efficiency of the generating facilities 
the psa runs for a term of fifteen years  with lipa having the option to renew the psa for an additional fifteen year term 
energy management agreement ema the ema provides for a keyspan subsidiary to procure and manage fuel supplies on behalf of lipa to fuel the generating facilities under contract to it and perform off system capacity and energy purchases on a least cost basis to meet lipa s needs 
in exchange for these services we earn an annual fee of million 
in addition  we arrange for off system sales on behalf of lipa of excess output from the generating facilities and other power supplies either owned or under contract to lipa 
lipa is entitled to two thirds of the profit from any off system energy sales 
in addition  the ema provides incentives and penalties that can total million annually for performance related to fuel purchases and off system power purchases 
the ema covers a period of fifteen years to for the procurement of fuel supplies and eight years to for off system management services 
under these agreements  we are required to obtain a letter of credit in the aggregate amount of million supporting our obligations to provide the various services if our long term debt is not rated in the a range by a nationally recognized rating agency 
generation purchase right agreement gpra under the gpra  lipa had the right for a one year period beginning on may   to acquire all of our long island based generating assets formerly owned by lilco at fair market value at the time of the exercise of such right 
by agreement dated march   lipa and keyspan amended the gpra to provide for a new six month option period ending on may  the other terms of the option reflected in the gpra remained unchanged 
in return for providing lipa an extension of the gpra  keyspan has been provided with a corresponding extension of months for the msa to the end of the extension is the result of a new initiative established by lipa to work with keyspan and others to review long island s long term energy needs 
lipa and keyspan will jointly analyze new energy supply options including re powering existing plants  renewable energy technologies  distributed generation  conservation initiatives and retail competition 
the extension allows both lipa and keyspan to explore alternatives to the gpra including re powering existing facilities  the sale of some or all of keyspan s plants to lipa  or the sale of some or all of these plants to other investor owned entities 
keyspan glenwood and port jefferson energy centers keyspan glenwood energy center llc and keyspan port jefferson energy center llc have entered into year power purchase agreements with lipa the ppas 
under the terms of the ppas  these subsidiaries sell capacity  energy conversion services and ancillary services to lipa 
both plants are designed to produce megawatts 
under the ppas  lipa pays a monthly capacity fee  which guarantees full recovery of each plant s construction costs  as well as an appropriate rate of return on investment 
the ppas also obligate lipa to pay for each plant s costs of operation and maintenance 
these costs are billed on a monthly estimated basis and are subject to true up for actual costs incurred 
ravenswood facility we currently sell capacity  energy and ancillary services associated with the ravenswood facility through a bidding process into the nyiso energy markets on both a day ahead and a real time basis 
we also have the ability to enter into bilateral transactions to sell all or a portion of the energy produced by the ravenswood facility to load serving entities  ie entities that sell to end users or to brokers and marketers 
environmental matters keyspan is subject to various federal  state and local laws and regulatory programs related to the environment 
ongoing environmental compliance activities  which have not been material  are charged to operation and maintenance activities 
we estimate that the remaining cost of our manufactured gas plant mgp related environmental cleanup activities  including costs associated with the ravenswood facility  will be approximately million and we have recorded a related liability for such amount 
we have also recorded an additional million liability  representing the estimated environmental cleanup costs related to a former coal tar processing facility 
as of december   we have expended a total of million on environmental investigation and remediation activities 
see note to the consolidated financial statements  contractual obligations  guarantees and contingencies for a further explanation of these matters 
market and credit risk management activities market risk we are exposed to market risk arising from potential changes in one or more market variables  such as energy commodity price risk  interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  volumetric risk due to weather or other variables 
such risk includes any or all changes in value whether caused by commodity positions  asset ownership  business or contractual obligations  debt covenants  exposure concentration  currency  weather  and other factors regardless of accounting method 
we manage our exposure to changes in market prices using various risk management techniques for non trading purposes  including hedging through the use of derivative instruments  both exchange traded and over the counter contracts  purchase of insurance and execution of other contractual arrangements 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk and note to the consolidated financial statements hedging  derivative financial instruments and fair values for a further explanation of derivative financial instruments 
credit risk we are exposed to credit risk arising from the potential that our counter parties fail to perform on their contractual obligations 
our credit exposures are created primarily through the sale of gas and transportation services to residential  commercial  electric generation  and industrial customers and the provision of retail access services to gas marketers  by our regulated gas businesses  the sale of commodities and services to lipa and the nyiso  the sale of gas power and services to our retail customers by our unregulated energy service businesses  entering into financial and energy derivative contracts with energy marketing companies and financial institutions  and the sale of gas  natural gas liquids  oil and processing services to energy marketing and oil and gas production companies 
we have regional concentration of credit risk due to receivables from residential  commercial and industrial customers in new york  new hampshire and massachusetts  although this credit risk is spread over a diversified base of residential  commercial and industrial customers 
customers payment records are monitored and action is taken  when appropriate 
companies within the energy services segment have a concentration of credit risk to large customers and to the governmental and healthcare industries 
we also have concentrations of credit risk from lipa  our largest customer  and from other energy companies 
concentration of energy company counter parties may impact overall exposure to credit risk in that our counter parties may be similarly impacted by changes in economic  regulatory or other considerations 
we actively monitor the credit profile of our wholesale counter parties in derivative and other contractual arrangements  and manage our level of exposure accordingly 
over the past year  the credit quality of certain energy companies has declined 
in instances where counter parties credit quality has declined  we limit our credit exposure by restricting new transactions with the counter party  requiring additional collateral or credit support and negotiating the early termination of certain agreements 
regulatory issues and competitive environment we are subject to various other risk exposures and uncertainties associated with our gas and electric operations 
the most significant contingency involves the evolution of the gas distribution and electric industries towards more competitive and deregulated environments 
set forth below is a description of these exposures 
the gas industry long island and new york the nypsc continues to conduct collaborative proceedings on ways to develop the competitive energy market in new york 
on july   the presiding officers in the case issued their recommended decision rd 
the rd recommends that the nypsc adopt an end state vision that includes removing the utilities from the provision of the energy gas and electric commodity 
the rd also recommends that utilities exit the commodity function only where there is a workably competitive market 
the rd states that the only market that is currently workably competitive is the commodity market for non residential large use gas customers 
parties filed briefs on and opposing exceptions to the rd 
on may   the nypsc issued an order adopting terms of gas restructuring joint proposal petition of keyspan energy delivery new york and keyspan energy delivery long island for a multi year restructuring agreement joint proposal 
the joint proposal did not alter base rate levels  but established a merchant function backout credit of 
dth and 
dth for kedny and kedli  respectively 
these credits are designed to lower transportation rates charged to transportation only customers 
these credits were based on established levels of projected avoided costs and levels of customer migration to non utility commodity service 
lost revenues resulting from application of these credits will be recovered from firm gas sales customers 
as a result of circumstances in  including the california energy crisis and the bankruptcy of enron corp  state regulators around the country are reassessing the pace of movement toward deregulation 
we are unable to predict the outcome or pace of this trend or its ultimate effect on our results of operation  financial condition or cash flows 
on december   new york state governor george pataki signed into law the energy consumer protection act of act 
the act defines energy services companies that provide gas or electric commodity service to customers as utilities subject to the home energy fair practices act provisions hefpa of the new york public service law 
under the act  in certain circumstances utilities such as kedny and kedli will be required to suspend distribution service to customers whose commodity service has been terminated by an energy services company 
generally  those energy services companies are required under the act to provide these customers with the same consumer protections prescribed under hefpa as are prescribed for full service sales customers of gas distribution companies 
those consumer protections include a series of notices warning of potential service termination  offering deferred payment agreements  and special protections for elderly  blind and disabled customers 
the act contemplates that the nypsc will promulgate regulations implementing the act  but such regulations have not yet been promulgated 
the act becomes effective on june  we cannot predict the impact of the act on keyspan s regulated or unregulated operations at this time 
new england in july  the dte directed massachusetts gas distribution companies to undertake a collaborative process with other stakeholders to develop common principles under which comprehensive gas service unbundling might proceed 
a settlement agreement by the local distribution companies ldcs and the marketer group regarding model terms and conditions for unbundled transportation service was approved by the dte in november in february  the dte issued its order on how unbundling of natural gas service will proceed 
for a five year transition period  the dte determined that ldc contractual commitments to upstream capacity will be assigned on a mandatory  pro rata basis to marketers selling gas supply to the ldc s customers 
the approved mandatory assignment method eliminates the possibility that the costs of upstream capacity purchased by the ldcs to serve firm customers will be absorbed by the ldc or other customers through the transition period 
the dte also found that  through the transition period  ldcs will retain primary responsibility for upstream capacity planning and procurement to assure that adequate capacity is available to support customer requirements and growth 
the dte approved the ldcs terms and conditions of distribution service that conform to the settled upon model terms and conditions 
since november   all massachusetts gas customers have the option to purchase their gas supplies from third party sources other than the ldcs 
further  the new hampshire public utility commission required gas utilities to offer transportation services to all commercial and residential customers starting november  we believe that the actions described above strike a balance among competing stakeholder interests in order to most effectively make available the benefits of the unbundled gas supply market to all customers 
electric industry the ravenswood facility and our new york city operations the nyiso s new york city local reliability rules currently require that of the electric capacity needs of new york city be provided by in city generators 
as additional  more efficient electric power plants are built in new york city and the surrounding areas  the requirement that of in city load be served by in city generators could be modified 
construction of new transmission facilities could also cause significant changes to the market 
if generation and or transmission facilities are constructed  and or the availability of our ravenswood facility deteriorates  then the capacity and energy sales volumes could be adversely affected 
we cannot predict  however  when or if new power plants or transmission facilities will be built or the nature of future new york city energy requirements or market design 
regional transmission organizations and standard market design during  the ferc issued several orders and began several proceedings related to the development of regional transmission organizations rto and the design of the wholesale energy markets 
the details of how rtos will be formed are currently evolving 
on july   ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr intended to establish a standardized national market design and rules for competitive wholesale electric markets standard market design or smd 
these rules would apply to transmission owners tos  independent system operators isos  and rtos 
the smd is intended to create i genuine wholesale competition  ii efficient transmission systems  iii the right pricing signals for investment in transmission and generation facilities  and iv more customer options 
how the smd will be implemented will be based on ferc s final rules in this regard  as well as the subject of various compliance filings by tos  isos  and rtos 
we do not know how the markets will develop nor how these proposed changes will impact the operations of the nyiso or its market rules 
furthermore  we are unable to determine to what extent  if any  this process will impact the ravenswood facility s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
new york independent system operator matters on may   ferc approved the nyiso s mitigation plan the plan 
the plan retains existing mitigation measures such as  mwhr energy price caps  non spinning reserve bid caps  in city capacity and energy mitigation measures  the day ahead automated mitigation procedure amp  and the nyiso s general mitigation authority 
in addition  the plan implements a new in city real time automated mitigation procedure 
although prices for various energy products in the nyiso markets have softened  it is not known to what extent each of these proceedings and revised rules may impact the ravenswood facility s financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the market risks discussed below relate to our derivative financial instruments 
we have derivative financial instruments and derivative commodity contracts that are exposed to potential losses due to adverse changes in interest rates  commodity prices and weather 
interest rate risk generally is related to our outstanding debt and financing activities 
the majority of our commodity price risk and volumetric risk due to weather relate to our ravenswood merchant electric operations  exploration and production operations and our gas distribution operations 
we use derivative contracts to manage price risk and volumetric risk exposure from these activities 
financially settled commodity derivative instruments from time to time keyspan has utilized derivative financial instruments  such as futures  options and swaps  for the purpose of hedging exposure to commodity price risk and to hedge the cash flow variability associated with a portion of peak electric energy sales 
houston exploration has utilized collars  as well as over the counter otc swaps to hedge the cash flow variability associated with forecasted sales of a portion of its natural gas production 
as of december   houston exploration has hedged approximately and of its estimated and production  respectively 
further  houston exploration may enter into additional derivative positions for and houston exploration used standard new york mercantile exchange nymex futures prices and published volatility in its black scholes calculation to value its outstanding derivatives 
the maximum length of time over which houston exploration has hedged such cash flow variability is through december the estimated amount of losses associated with such derivative instruments that are reported in other comprehensive income and that are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months is million  or million after tax 
with respect to price exposure associated with fuel purchases for the ravenswood facility  keyspan employs standard nymex natural gas futures contracts and over the counter financially settled natural gas basis swaps to hedge the cash flow variability of a portion of forecasted purchases of natural gas 
keyspan also employs the use of financially settled oil swap contracts to hedge the cash flow variability of a portion of forecasted purchases of fuel oil that will be consumed at the ravenswood facility 
the maximum length of time over which we have hedged cash flow variability associated with i forecasted purchases of natural gas is through december  and ii forecasted purchases of fuel oil is through april we used standard nymex futures prices to value the gas futures contracts and industry published oil indices for number grade fuel oil to value the oil swap contracts 
the estimated amount of gains associated with all such derivative instruments that are reported in other comprehensive income and that are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months is million  or million after tax 
our retail gas and electric marketing subsidiary  our domestic gas distribution operations and keyspan canada employed nymex natural gas futures contracts and natural gas swaps to lock in a price for expected future natural gas purchases 
as applicable  we used standard nymex futures prices and relevant natural gas indices to value the outstanding contracts 
the maximum length of time over which we have hedged such cash flow variability is through december the estimated amount of gains associated with such derivative instruments that are reported in other comprehensive income and that are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months is million  or million after tax 
we have also engaged in the use of cash settled swap instruments to hedge the cash flow variability associated with i a portion of forecasted peak electric energy sales from the ravenswood facility and ii forecasted sales of unforced capacity ucap to the nyiso 
the maximum length of time over which we have hedged cash flow variability is through march we used nyiso location zone published indices as well as published nyiso bidding prices to value these outstanding derivatives 
the estimated amount of losses associated with such derivative instruments that are reported in other comprehensive income and that are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months is million  or million after tax 
keyspan canada also has employed electricity swap contracts to lock in the purchase price of electricity needed to operate its gas processing plants 
these contracts are not exchange traded and local published indices were used to value these outstanding swap agreements 
the maximum length of time over which we have hedged such cash flow variability is through december the estimated amount of losses associated with such derivative instruments that are reported in other comprehensive income and that are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months is million  or million after tax 
the following tables set forth selected financial data associated with these derivative financial instruments noted above that were outstanding at december type of contract year of volumes current fair value maturity mmcf floor ceiling fixed price price gas collars   swaps futures short natural gas   swaps futures long natural gas   fair type of contract year of volumes current value maturity barrel fixed price price oil swaps short fuel oil  swaps long fuel oil   fair type of contract year of fixed margin value maturity capacity mwh price current price electricity swaps energy   swaps capacity  change in fair value of derivative instruments fair value of contracts at january   gain on contracts realized  fair value of new contracts when entered into during period decrease in fair value of all open contracts  fair value of contracts outstanding at december   nymex futures are also used to economically hedge the cash flow variability associated with the purchase of fuel for a portion of our fleet vehicles 
further  keyspan canada has a portfolio of financially settled natural gas collars and natural gas liquid swap transactions 
such contracts are executed by keyspan canada to i synthetically fix the price that is paid or received by keyspan canada for certain physical transactions involving natural gas and natural gas liquids and ii transfer the price exposure of such instruments to other trading partners 
in addition  our retail gas and electric marketing subsidiary has bought options to economically hedge the cash flow variability associated with a portion of expected future natural gas purchases 
these derivative financial instruments do not qualify for hedge accounting under sfas at december   these instruments had a net fair market value of million  that was recorded on the consolidated balance sheet 
based on the non hedge designation of these instruments  the loss was recognized in the consolidated statement of income 
firm gas sales derivative instruments regulated utilities we also use derivative financial instruments to reduce the cash flow variability associated with the purchase price for a portion of future natural gas purchases 
our strategy is to minimize fluctuations in firm gas sales prices to our regulated firm gas sales customers in our new york and new hampshire service territories 
since these derivative instruments are employed to reduce the variability of the purchase price of natural gas to be sold to regulated firm gas sales customers  the accounting for these derivative instruments is subject to sfas therefore  changes in the market value of these derivatives have been recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
gains or losses on the settlement of these contracts are initially deferred and then refunded to or collected from our firm gas sales customers during the appropriate winter heating season consistent with regulatory requirements 
the following table sets forth selected financial data associated with these derivative financial instruments that were outstanding at december  fair type of contract year of volumes value maturity mmcf fixed price current price options   swaps   physically settled commodity derivative instruments on april  we implemented derivative implementation group dig issue c and c of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended and interpreted  incorporating sfas and sfas and certain implementation issues collectively sfas 
issue c establishes new criteria that must be satisfied in order for option type and forward contracts in electricity to be exempted as normal purchases and sales  while issue c relates to the exemption as normal purchases and normal sales of contracts that combine a forward contract and a purchased option contract 
based upon a review of our physical commodity contracts  we determined that certain contracts for the physical purchase of natural gas can no longer be exempted as normal purchases from the requirements of sfas at december   the fair value of these contracts was million 
since these contracts are for the purchase of natural gas sold to regulated firm gas sales customers  the accounting for these contracts is subject to sfas therefore  changes in the market value of these contracts have been recorded as a regulatory asset or regulatory liability on the consolidated balance sheet 
interest rate derivative instruments during most of  we had interest rate swap agreements in which approximately billion of fixed rate debt had been synthetically modified to floating rate debt 
under the terms of the agreements  we received the fixed coupon rate associated with these bonds and paid the counter parties a variable interest rate that was reset on a quarterly basis 
these swaps were designated as fair value hedges and qualified for short cut hedge accounting treatment under sfas through the utilization of these agreements  we reduced recorded interest expense by million for the twelve months ended december  in early november  we terminated two interest rate swap agreements with an aggregate notional amount of billion and received million from our swap counter parties  of which million represented accrued swap interest 
the difference between the termination settlement amount and the amount of accrued swap interest  million  will be amortized to earnings as an adjustment to interest expense on a level yield basis over the remaining lives of the originally hedged debt obligations 
the remaining swap  which had a notional amount of million  and a fair market value of million at december   was terminated on february  we received million from our swap counter parties  of which million represents accrued swap interest 
the difference between the termination settlement amount and the amount of accrued interest  million  will be recorded to earnings in the first quarter of this swap was used to hedge a portion of our outstanding promissory notes to lipa 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements long term debt  we intend to redeem a portion of these promissory notes before the end of the first quarter of additionally  we also have an interest rate swap agreement that hedges the cash flow variability associated with the forecasted issuance of a series of commercial paper offerings 
the maximum length of time over which we have hedged such cash flow variability is through march the estimated amount of loss associated with such derivative instruments that are reported in other comprehensive income and that are expected to be reclassified into earnings over the next twelve months is million  or million after tax 
weather derivatives the utility tariffs associated with kedne s operations do not contain weather normalization adjustments 
as a result  fluctuations from normal weather may have a significant positive or negative effect on the results of these operations 
to mitigate a substanial portion of the effect of fluctuations from normal weather on our financial position and cash flows  we sold heating degree day call options and purchased heating degree day put options for the november march winter season 
with respect to sold call options  keyspan is required to make a payment of  per heating degree day to its counter parties when actual weather experienced during the november march time frame is above  heating degree days  which equates to approximately colder than normal weather 
with respect to purchased put options  keyspan will receive a  per heating degree day payment from its counter parties when actual weather is below  heating degree days  or is approximately warmer than normal 
based on the terms of such contracts  as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies  we account for such instruments pursuant to the requirements of eitf  accounting for weather derivatives 
in this regard  we account for such instruments using the intrinsic value method as set forth in such guidance 
during the fourth quarter of  weather was colder than normal and  as a result  million has been recorded as a reduction to revenues 
derivative contracts are primarily used to manage exposure to market risk arising from changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
in the event of nonperformance by a counter party to a derivative contract  the desired impact may not be achieved 
the risk of a counter party nonperformance is generally considered credit risk and is actively managed by assessing each counter party credit profile and negotiating appropriate levels of collateral and credit support 
foreign currency fluctuations we follow the principles of sfas  foreign currency translation for recording our investments in foreign affiliates 
due to our continued activities in canada and northern ireland  our investment in foreign affiliates has been growing 
at december   the net assets of these affiliates was approximately million and at december   the accumulated after tax foreign currency translation included in other comprehensive income was a debit of million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies
