item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview copper mountain s current operating activities include developing  building and testing the vantedge product line and establishing relationships with its target customers 
in the future  we expect that revenue growth  if any  will be substantially dependent on sales of the vantedge product 
the vantedge product is generally available for sale  however  we have yet to generate material revenues from the sale of the vantedge product line 
currently  our revenue is generated primarily from sales of and service on our copperedge dsl concentrators  or ce  and the related wide area network wan modules and line modules 
additionally  we license network management software which provides monitoring and management capabilities for the ce  revenues from which have not been material to date 
revenues generated from the ce product line has declined on an annual basis over the past two years 
for the year ended december   sales to our three largest customers accounted for approximately of our revenue  of which sales to versatel  mpower  and at t accounted for approximately  and of our revenue  respectively 
while the level of sales to any specific customer is anticipated to vary from period to period  we expect that we will continue to have significant customer concentration for the foreseeable future 
our customers buying patterns have become unpredictable 
future sales  if any  to the significant customers mentioned above may be substantially less than historical sales 
the loss of any one of our major customers or the delay of significant orders from such customers  even if only temporary  could among other things reduce or delay our net revenue  adversely impact our ability to sustain or achieve annual or quarterly profitability and adversely impact our ability to generate positive cash flow  and  as a consequence  could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we market and sell our products directly to telecommunications service providers and through distributors 
we generally recognize revenue from product sales or sales type leases upon shipment if collection of the resulting receivable is probable and product returns are reasonably estimated and the sales type lease criteria are met 
no revenue is recognized on products shipped on a trial basis 
estimated sales returns  based on historical experience by product  are recorded at the time the product revenue is recognized 
to date  significant revenues generated from international sources are entirely comprised of sales to versatel 
we expect our gross margin to be affected by many factors including competitive pricing pressures  fluctuations in manufacturing volumes  costs of components and sub assemblies  costs from our contract manufacturers  the mix of products or system configurations sold and the volume and timing of sales of follow on line cards for systems shipped in prior periods 
as of december   we had a substantial amount of fully reserved finished goods and component inventory for the ce product line 
our reserve had been established based on our projection  which indicated certain inventories would not be used or would be sold below its original cost 
in the future  we could utilize fully reserved components to complete product  which could result in higher gross margins 
the gross margin realized will be highly dependent upon our cost to 
table of contents complete the units and our ability to sustain pricing at current levels which may prove to be difficult given the severe pricing pressures that we are currently experiencing 
in addition  our overall gross margin realized on sales of our products may fluctuate widely and will be highly dependent upon sales mix  utilization of fully reserved inventory  if any  and the prices at which our customers are willing to purchase our products 
we outsource most of our manufacturing and supply chain management operations  and we conduct manufacturing engineering  quality assurance  program management  documentation control and product repairs at our facility in san diego  california 
accordingly  a significant portion of our cost of revenue during the periods presented consists of payments to our contract manufacturers which in was principally with plexus corporation 
we selected our manufacturing partner with the goal of ensuring a reliable supply of high quality finished products and of lowering per unit product costs as a result of manufacturing economies of scale 
however  we cannot assure you that we will maintain the volumes required to realize these economies of scale or when or if such cost reductions will occur 
the failure to obtain such cost reductions could materially adversely affect our gross margins and operating results 
during the years ended december    and we recorded credits charges to cost of revenue for inventory on hand and on order totaling million  million  and million respectively 
the million credit taken in was related to a reduction in adverse purchase commitments taken in prior periods 
the amounts of the charges were determined based on estimates of the amounts we were committed to purchase and the anticipated demand for our products at the time the charges were taken 
actual results could differ from our estimates 
our customers buying patterns have become unpredictable 
accordingly  actual demand for our products could be materially less or more than our estimates 
the ultimate amount of inventory purchase commitments and ultimate amount of excess inventory cost incurred could differ materially from our estimates as a result of these uncertainties 
research and development expenses consist principally of salaries and related personnel expenses  consultant fees and prototype expenses related to the design  development and testing of our products and enhancement of our network management software 
we believe that continued investment in research and development is critical to attaining our strategic product objectives 
sales and marketing expenses consist of salaries  commissions and related expenses for personnel engaged in marketing  sales and field service support functions  as well as trade shows and promotional expenses 
general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for executive  finance  human resources  management information systems and administrative personnel  recruiting expenses  professional fees  bad debt expenses and other general corporate expenses 
during the year ended december   we recorded a net charge of million in bad debt expense related to an investment in a sales type lease 
this charge was estimated based on an updated credit assessment of the lessee 
during the year ended december   we received approximately million in lease payments under this sales type lease and recorded those payments as a reduction of bad debt expense  which have been included in general and administrative expenses 
prior to the year ended december   amortization of deferred stock compensation resulted from the granting of stock options to employees with exercise prices per share determined to be below the fair values per share for financial reporting purposes of our common stock at dates of grant 
during the year ended december   additional deferred compensation was recorded as part of the purchase price of onprem networks corporation 
during the second quarter of  additional deferred compensation was recorded in conjunction with our stock option exchange program see note of the notes to financial statements 
during the third and fourth quarter of  additional deferred compensation was recorded in conjunction with a grant of restricted stock to employees 
during the third quarter of  additional deferred compensation was recorded in conjunction with a stock option re pricing program 
the intrinsic value of the 
table of contents options to purchase common stock granted under the exchange program will be re measured at the end of each period for the life of the option 
we expect that the total amount of compensation expense that will be recognized under the exchange program and the re pricing program could vary from period to period and the ultimate amount of compensation expense that will be recognized is not currently determinable 
the deferred compensation is being amortized to expense in accordance with fasb interpretations no 
and no 
over the vesting period of the individual options 
we recorded total deferred stock compensation of million from inception to december  and amortized million from inception to december  during  the company granted  shares of restricted common stock to certain employees 
during  the company granted  shares of restricted common stock to certain employees 
the related net compensation expense of approximately million will be amortized in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
over the vesting period of approximately two years 
the company recognized compensation expense of million and million related to this grant of restricted common stock for the year ended december  and as of december  approximately  restricted shares had vested and approximately  of the restricted shares had been cancelled 
as of december  approximately  shares of restricted stock remain outstanding and unvested 
approximately  shares of the remaining restricted stock outstanding vests in august of approximately  and  shares of the restricted shares remaining outstanding vest quarterly and monthly  respectively 
the shares are restricted as to sale or transfer until vesting  deferred stock compensation and amortization of deferred stock compensation could materially increase or decrease in future periods depending on changes in the company s stock price and other factors 
on march   the company announced that it had adopted a business plan to re size its business to reflect current and expected business conditions 
this restructuring plan was largely completed during as a result of the adoption of this plan  the company recorded charges of million during the three months ended march  these charges primarily relate to consolidation of the company s continuing operations resulting in impairment of assets  anticipated losses on disposition of assets as well as excess lease costs  and the elimination of job responsibilities  resulting in costs incurred for employee severance 
employee reductions occurred in almost all areas of the company  including operations  marketing  sales and administrative areas 
as a result of this plan  the company had reduced its non temporary work force by approximately positions 
substantially all reductions related to this plan occurred prior to march  on august   the company announced that it had adopted a business plan to again re size its business to reflect current and expected business conditions 
this restructuring plan was largely completed during as a result of the adoption of this plan  the company recorded charges of million during the three months ended september  these charges primarily relate to consolidation of the company s continuing operations resulting in impairment of assets  anticipated losses on disposition of assets as well as excess lease costs  and the elimination of job responsibilities  resulting in costs incurred for employee severance 
employee reductions occurred in all areas of the company 
as a result of this plan  the company reduced its non temporary work force by approximately additional positions 
substantially all reductions occurred prior to september  as a part of these plans  the carrying values of certain assets were written down 
the impaired assets include furniture  leasehold improvements  computers and other assets used in certain of the areas of the company impacted by the reduction in force 
the projected future cash flows from these assets were less than the carrying values of the assets 
the carrying values of the assets held for sale and the assets to be held and used were reduced to their estimated fair values based on the present value of the estimated expected future cash flows 
estimated expected future cash flows for the impaired assets are not significant 
in the year ended december   the company recorded losses from impairment of assets of million  which were recorded as restructuring costs 
the cost of these losses was previously estimated to be million 
this estimate was reduced by the utilization of assets  primarily laboratory equipment  previously estimated to be held for disposition 
substantially all of the impaired assets are being held for disposition and will not continue to be depreciated 
depreciation expense for the year ended december  was reduced by million as a result of this charge 
the depreciation expense will be reduced by million  million  million and 
table of contents million for the years ending december    and  respectively  as a result of this charge 
also as part of these plans  the company elected to consolidate its operations and attempt to sublease certain of its facilities  which housed portions of its operations  marketing  sales and administrative activities 
in the year ended december   the company recorded estimated excess lease costs of million which were recorded as restructuring costs 
estimated excess lease costs are based on assumptions of differences between lease payments and sublease receipts that could be realized on potential subleases and assumed carrying terms 
these assumptions are based on reasonably possible rates and terms from other recent leases of comparable properties 
the excess lease costs were previously estimated to be million 
the increase in this estimate is attributable to an increase in the estimated holding periods for the remaining leases and decreased estimated sublease receipts based on continuing deterioration in the market for comparable rental office space 
the rates and terms of the actual sub leases may differ materially from these estimates 
future cash outlays related to these plans are expected to be completed in on july   the company announced that it had adopted a business plan to re size its business to reflect current and expected business conditions 
this restructuring plan was largely completed during as a result of the adoption of this plan  the company recorded charges of approximately million during the three and nine months ended september  these charges primarily relate to consolidation of the company s continuing operations resulting in impairment of assets  anticipated losses on disposition of assets and excess lease costs  and the elimination of job responsibilities  resulting in costs incurred for employee severance 
employee reductions occurred in almost all areas of the company  including engineering  operations  research and development  marketing  sales and administrative areas 
as a result of this plan  the company reduced its non temporary work force by approximately positions 
details of the restructuring charges are as follows in s cash non cash reserve balance at december  charge activity reserve balance at december  impairment of assets non cash excess lease costs cash elimination of job responsibilities cash cash non cash reserve balance at december  charge activity reserve balance at december  impairment of assets non cash excess lease costs cash elimination of job responsibilities cash in connection with these plans  the onprem product line was discontinued 
accordingly  management determined that the estimated future cash flows from certain intangible assets acquired in the purchase of onprem networks corporation would likely not be sufficient to recover the carrying value of such assets 
the company calculated the present value of expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of the assets 
this evaluation resulted in a write off of million of goodwill and other intangible assets in the year ended december  the underlying factors contributing to the decline in expected financial results included changes in the company s strategic focus in the marketplace and an overall decline in the telecommunications equipment market 

table of contents critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which are prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
examples include estimated restructuring costs  excess inventory and adverse purchase commitments  provisions for returns  bad debts  warranty costs  and the ultimate realizability of investments and the ultimate outcome of litigation 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we have several critical accounting policies that are both important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and require management s most difficult  subjective and complex judgments 
typically  the circumstances that make these judgments complex and difficult have to do with making estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
our critical accounting policies are as follows as discussed under warranty reserves in note of the notes to the financial statements  the company provides limited warranties on certain of its products for periods of up to one year 
the company recognizes warranty reserves when products are shipped based upon an estimate of total warranty costs  and such reserves are included in accrued liabilities 
the estimate of such costs is based upon historical and anticipated requirements 
as discussed under inventory in note of the notes to the financial statements  inventory is stated at the lower of cost  principally standard costs  which approximates actual costs on a first in  first out basis  or market 
the company estimates the market value of its inventory based upon anticipated future demand for its products 
as discussed under revenue recognition in note of the notes to the financial statements revenue is recognized when all four of the following criteria are met i persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  ii delivery of the products and or services has occurred  iii the selling price is fixed or determinable and  iv collectibility is reasonably assured 
sales returns are estimated based on historical experience and management s expectations and are recorded at the time product revenue is recognized 
in addition  the company leases equipment to customers under non cancelable sales type leases with terms of generally three to four years 
annual service and support arrangements can be purchased by customers for products no longer under warranty and are generally billed quarterly 
revenue from service and support arrangements is recognized ratably as services are performed 
the company may extend limited stock rotation  product return and price protection rights to certain distributors and resellers

our future sales will be substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully commercialize and sell our vantedge product 
gross margin 
our gross margin increased from million or in to million or in the increase in gross margin  relative to the prior year  occurred primarily due to million in charges taken during the year ended december  to reduce certain inventory to its estimated net realizable value 
in addition  we recognized a one time gain of million in related to a reduction in purchase commitments previously charged to cost of revenue and the sale of inventory in that had previously been written down by million 
research and development 
our research and development expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of lower compensation costs as a result of 
table of contents lower headcount  and lower spending on prototype equipment  employee recruiting and travel costs 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue was flat at approximately 
we intend to continue to invest in research and development programs in future periods for the primary purpose of developing new products and enhancing our existing products 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in personnel expenses for sales and marketing staff  decreased promotional and product marketing expenses  decreased sales commissions associated with lower net revenue  decreased expenses related to customer support and decreased travel costs 
the decrease in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenue from in to in was the result of a decrease in cost as noted above which was partially offset by the decrease in our net revenue during general and administrative 
our general and administrative expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in bad debt expense  decreased staffing for finance  management information systems  and human resources  and reductions in recruiting and facility related expenses

general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue decreased from in to in this increase as a percentage of sales was primarily the result of the items mentioned above 
amortization of purchased intangibles 
amortization of purchased intangibles decreased from million in to zero in we purchased onprem networks corporation on february  for approximately million 
as a result of the purchase we recorded purchased intangibles of approximately million 
immediately following the purchase we wrote off million of in process research and development in for projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and for which there was no alternative future use 
such amount was determined with the assistance of a third party appraiser based upon the present value of estimated future cash flow contributions from the identified projects 
the remaining purchased intangibles were being amortized over a three year period from the date of the acquisition 
during the second quarter of  we calculated the present value of expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of the assets 
this evaluation resulted in a write off of million of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the underlying factors contributing to the decline in expected financial results included changes in our strategic focus in the marketplace and an overall decline in the telecommunications equipment market 
in connection with these plans  the onprem product line was discontinued 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased from million in to million in this decrease reflects a decrease in interest income generated from lower average cash balances and investments in marketable securities in and decreased average yields on such investments 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was zero for and years ended december  and net revenue 
our revenue decreased from million in to million in this decrease was due to significantly fewer sales of our ce and ce dsl access concentrators and related line cards

our customers buying patterns have become unpredictable 
future sales  if any  to the other significant customers mentioned above may be substantially less than historical sales 
our future sales will be substantially dependent upon our ability to successfully introduce  commercialize and sell our vantedge product 
gross margin 
our gross margin decreased from million in to million in the decrease in gross margin occurred primarily because of charges taken during the year ended december  to reduce inventory to an estimated net realizable value  a decrease in net revenue  decreased average selling prices and decreased production volumes 
gross margin percentages also decreased on a year over year basis  from for the year ended december  to for the year ended december  during the year ended december   the company recorded charges totaling million related to future inventory purchase commitments of finished products and raw materials in excess of anticipated requirements  including charges of million which were expected to be non recurring and excess inventory on hand compared to comparable charges of million  including charges of million which were expected to be non recurring for the year ended december  before the impact of these charges  gross margin as a percentage of sales for the year ended december  was relatively consistent with that of the prior year 
research and development 
our research and development expenses were relatively consistent at million in compared to million in during  increases in consulting and services and salaries and benefits were offset by decreases in spending on prototype equipment  employee recruiting and travel costs 
research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue increased from in to in the increase in research and development expense as a percentage of net revenue was primarily the result of a decrease in our net revenue during we intend to continue to invest in research and development programs in future periods for the purpose of enhancing current products  reducing the cost of current products and developing new products 
sales and marketing 
our sales and marketing expenses decreased from million in to million in this decrease was primarily the result of a decrease in personnel expenses for sales and marketing staff  decreased promotional and product marketing expenses  decreased sales commissions associated with lower net revenue  decreased expenses related to customer support and decreased travel costs 
the increase in sales and marketing expense as a percentage of net revenue from in to in was primarily the result of a decrease in our net revenue during general and administrative

amortization of purchased intangibles decreased from million in to million in we purchased onprem networks corporation on february  for approximately million 
as a result of the purchase we recorded purchased intangibles of approximately million 
immediately following the purchase we wrote off million of in process research and development in for projects for which technological feasibility had not been established and for which there was no alternative future use 
such amount was determined with the assistance of a third party appraiser based upon the present value of estimated future cash flow contributions from the identified projects 
the remaining purchased intangibles were being amortized over a three year period from the date of the acquisition 
during the second quarter of  we calculated the present value of expected future cash flows to

the underlying factors contributing to the decline in expected financial results included changes in our strategic focus in the marketplace and an overall decline in the telecommunications equipment market 
in connection with these plans  the onprem product line was discontinued 
interest and other income 
interest and other income decreased from million in to million in this decrease reflects a decrease in interest income generated from lower average cash balances and investments in marketable securities in and decreased average yields on such investments 
income taxes 
our effective income tax rate was for compared to for the reduction in the effective tax rate is primarily a result of the net loss for the year ended december  and the estimate that it is not probable that our deferred tax assets generated from the net loss in will be realized based on anticipated future results 
liquidity and capital resources currently  we are not generating sufficient revenue to fund our operations 
we expect our operating losses  net operating cash outflows and capital expenditures to continue if we are unable to increase sales 
on march   august   and july   we announced that we had adopted business plans to re size our business to reflect current and expected business conditions 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to decrease our operating expenses significantly below current levels and still remain viable and competitive 
if we are unable to realize sufficient savings from re sizing our business  and or sufficiently increase our revenues  our ability to deploy and service our products  fund our operations or respond to competitive pressures could be significantly impaired 
at december   we had cash and cash equivalents of million and short term marketable investments of million 
we currently require approximately million to million in cash per quarter to fund our operations  and we presently expect that this rate of quarterly cash use to continue through based on our current estimates  we believe that we have sufficient cash  cash equivalents and marketable investments to fund our operations for at least the next eighteen months 
these estimates reflect various assumptions  including the assumptions that the sales of our existing products will continue at approximately the same levels as in the fourth quarter of  that testing  continued development and commercialization of our new vantedge product proceeds as planned  that we do not incur significant additional expenses related to litigation including any adverse determination in any of the litigation described elsewhere in this form k under the heading legal proceedings 
any of these assumptions may prove to be incorrect 
in particular  revenues from sales of our products have decreased in the last two years 
in the future  it is unclear whether we will continue to generate revenue from sales of products at the same levels  if at all 
finally  the enhancement and commercialization of our vantedge product might be delayed or might require the expenditure of significantly more funds than currently anticipated  in which case our liquidity and capital resources would be adversely affected 
in order to fund our operations beyond the second quarter of  we expect that we will have to raise additional funds 
we anticipate that we will have to seek equity or long term debt financing in the private or public capital markets to obtain the funds we need to continue operations 
additional financing may not be available when needed on terms and conditions favorable to us or at all 
if adequate funds are not available or are not available on acceptable terms and conditions  we may be unable to fund our ongoing operations 
in addition  our inability to obtain cash may impair our ability to successfully introduce  commercialize and generate revenues from our vantedge product  
table of contents damage our customers perceptions of us and our management team  inhibit our ability to sell our products to a customer base which values financial strength and stability  and decrease our stock price 
cash provided by or used in operating activities for the years ended december   and was million  million  and million  respectively

the increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of common stock 
the increase in cash used in financing activities for the year ended december  compared to the prior year was primarily due to a decrease in proceeds from the sale of common stock and an increase in payments made on capital lease obligations our future capital requirements will depend upon many factors  including the timing of research and product development efforts and marketing efforts 
we expect to continue to expend amounts on property and equipment related to facility infrastructure  computer equipment and for research and development laboratory and test equipment to support on going research and development operations 
our capital requirements may vary based upon the timing and the success of implementation of our business plan and as a result of regulatory  technological and competitive developments or if demand for our products and services is less than or more than expected  our obligation to purchase certain finished product and raw materials in excess of anticipated requirements is less than or more than expected  our plans or projections change or prove to be inaccurate  we make acquisitions  we accelerate or delay development or availability of new products including but not limited to our vantedge broadband service concentrator or otherwise alter the schedule or targets of our business plan implementation  or there is an adverse or favorable determination in any litigation to which we are a party 
we intend to use our cash and other resources for working capital and other general corporate purposes

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily from our long term debt arrangements and our investments in certain held to maturity securities 
under our current policies  we do not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a hypothetical basis point adverse move in interest rates along the entire interest rate yield curve would not materially affect the fair value of interest sensitive financial instruments at december
