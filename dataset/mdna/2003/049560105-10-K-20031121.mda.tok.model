item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations introduction this section provides management s discussion of the financial condition  cash flows and results of operations of atmos energy corporation with specific information on results of operations and liquidity and capital resources 
it includes management s interpretation of our financial results  the factors affecting these results  the major factors expected to affect future operating results and future investment and financing plans 
this discussion should be read in conjunction with the company s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
cautionary statement for the purposes of the safe harbor under the private securities litigation reform act of the statements contained in this annual report on form k may contain forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of all statements other than statements of historical fact included in this report are forward looking statements made in good faith by the company and are intended to qualify for the safe harbor from liability established by the private securities litigation reform act of when used in this report  or any other of the company s documents or oral presentations  the words anticipate  expect  estimate  plans  believes  objective  forecast  goal or similar words are intended to identify forward looking statements 
such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from those expressed or implied in the statements relating to the company s strategy  operations  markets  services  rates  recovery of costs  availability of gas supply and other factors 
these risks and uncertainties include the following adverse weather conditions such as warmer than normal weather in the company s utility service territories or colder than normal weather which could adversely affect our natural gas marketing activities  regulatory trends and decisions  including deregulation initiatives and the impact of rate proceedings before various state regulatory commissions  market risks beyond our control affecting our risk management activities including market liquidity  commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness  national  regional and local economic conditions  limited access to financial markets  inflation and increased gas costs  including their effect on commodity prices for natural gas  increased competition  and other uncertainties  all of which are difficult to predict and many of which are beyond the control of the company 
accordingly  while the company believes these forward looking statements to be reasonable  there can be no assurance that they will approximate actual experience or that the expectations derived from them will be realized 
further  the company undertakes no obligation to update or revise any of its forward looking statements whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
factors that may affect our future performance our performance in the future will primarily depend on the results of our utility and natural gas marketing operations 
several factors exist that could influence atmos future financial performance  some of which are described below 
they should be considered in connection with evaluating forward looking statements contained in this report or otherwise made by or on behalf of us since these factors could cause actual results and conditions to differ materially from those projected in these forward looking statements 
our operations are weather sensitive 
weather is one of the most significant factors influencing our performance 
our natural gas utility sales volumes and related revenues are correlated with heating requirements that result from cold winter weather 
our agricultural sales volumes are associated with the rainfall levels during the growing season in our west texas irrigation market 
however  weather normalized rates in effect in several of our jurisdictions should mitigate the adverse effects of warmer than normal weather on our utility operating results 
finally  sustained cold weather could adversely affect our natural gas marketing operations as we may be required to purchase gas at spot rates in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill some customer contracts 
our operations are subject to regulation which can directly impact our operations 
our natural gas utility business is subject to various regulated returns on its rate base in each of the states in which we operate 
we monitor the allowed rates of return  our effectiveness in earning such rates and initiate rate proceedings or operating changes as needed 
in addition  in the normal course of the regulatory environment  assets are placed in service and historical test periods are established before rate cases can be filed 
once rate cases are filed  regulatory bodies have the authority to suspend implementation of the new rates while studying the cases 
because of this process  we must temporarily suffer the negative financial effects of having placed assets in service without the benefit of rate relief  which is commonly referred to as regulatory lag 
in addition  our debt and equity financing programs are also subject to approval by regulatory bodies in certain states  which could limit our ability to take advantage of favorable short term market conditions 
our business could also be affected by deregulation initiatives  including the development of unbundling initiatives in the natural gas industry 
unbundling is the separation of the provision and pricing of local distribution gas services into discrete components 
it typically focuses on the separation of the distribution and gas supply components and the resulting opening of the regulated components of sales services to alternative unregulated suppliers of those services 
because of our enhanced technology and distribution system infrastructures  we believe that we are now positively positioned as unbundling evolves 
consequently  we expect there would be no significant adverse effect on our business should unbundling or further deregulation of the natural gas distribution service business occur 
finally  contractual limitations could adversely affect our ability to withdraw gas from storage  which could cause us to purchase gas at spot prices in a rising market to obtain sufficient volumes to fulfill customer contracts 
we seek to minimize this risk by increasing our storage capacity and enhancing the flexibility of our natural gas marketing contracts 
our operations are exposed to market risks that are beyond our control  which could result in financial losses 
our risk management operations are subject to market risks beyond our control including market liquidity  commodity price volatility and counterparty creditworthiness 
market liquidity is affected by the number of trading partners in the market 
as a result of the recent severe downturn in the natural gas marketing industry  the number of trading partners has been reduced  which could adversely impact the market liquidity for this industry and adversely affect our natural gas marketing operations 
further  although we maintain a risk management control policy  we may not be able to completely offset the price risk associated with volatile gas prices or the risk in our gas trading activities which could lead to financial losses 
physical trading also introduces price risk on any net open positions at the end of each trading day  as well as a risk of loss resulting from intra day fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements between the time natural gas is purchased or sold for future delivery and the time the related purchase or sale is hedged 
although we manage our business to maintain no open positions  at times  limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a short term basis 
net open positions may result in an adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations if market prices react in an unfavorable manner 
our utility segment uses a combination of storage and financial hedges to protect against volatility in gas prices and to help moderate the effects of higher customer accounts receivable caused by potentially higher gas prices 
our natural gas marketing segment manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixed price purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of a variety of financial derivatives 
we could realize financial losses on these activities as a result of volatility in the market value of the underlying commodities or if a counterparty fails to perform under a contract 
finally  the use of financial instruments to conduct our hedging and market risk activities subjects us to counterparty risk 
adverse changes in the creditworthiness of our counterparties could limit the level of trading activities with these parties and increase the risk that these parties may not perform under a contract 
we believe this risk is mitigated due to the large number of counterparties used in our risk management activities 
national  regional and local economic conditions have a direct impact on our operations 
our operations will always be affected by the conditions and overall strength of the national  regional and local economies  including interest rates  changes in the capital markets and increases in the costs of our primary commodity  natural gas 
these factors impact the amount of residential  industrial and commercial growth in our service territories 
additionally  these factors could adversely impact our customer collections 
further  aem s operations are concentrated in the natural gas industry  and its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks affecting that industry 
during  aem s credit risk increased due to higher natural gas prices as compared with the prior year 
however  we believe this risk is mitigated because a larger percentage of our natural gas marketing business in the current year is with municipal customers who typically are more creditworthy as compared with the prior year 
the execution of our business plan could be affected by an inability to access financial markets 
we rely upon access to both short term and longer term capital markets as a source of liquidity to satisfy our liquidity requirements 
although we believe we will maintain sufficient access to these financial markets  adverse changes in the economy  the overall health of the industries in which we operate and changes to our credit ratings could limit access to these markets and restrict the execution of our business plan 
inflation and increased gas costs could adversely impact our customer base and customer collections and increase our level of indebtedness 
inflation has caused increases in certain operating expenses  and has required assets to be replaced at higher costs 
we have a process in place to continually review the adequacy of our utility gas rates in relation to the increasing cost of providing service and the inherent regulatory lag in adjusting those gas rates 
historically  we have been able to budget and control operating expenses and investments within the amounts authorized to be collected in rates and intend to continue to do so 
the ability to control expenses is an important factor that will influence future results 
the rapid increases in the price of purchased gas  which has occurred in some prior years  causes us to experience a significant increase in short term debt because we must pay suppliers for gas when it is purchased  which can be significantly in advance of when these costs may be recovered through the collection of monthly customer bills for gas delivered 
increases in purchased gas costs also slow our utility collection efforts as customers are more likely to delay the payment of their gas bills  leading to higher than normal accounts receivable 
this situation also results in higher short term debt levels and increased bad debt expense 
should the price of purchased gas increase significantly in the upcoming heating season  we would expect increases in our short term debt  accounts receivable and bad debt expense during fiscal finally  higher costs of natural gas in recent years have already caused many of our utility customers to conserve in the use of our gas services and could lead to even more customers utilizing such conservation methods 
our operations are subject to increased competition 
we are facing increased competition from other energy suppliers as well as electric companies and from energy marketing and trading companies 
in the case of industrial customers  such as manufacturing plants  and agricultural customers  adverse economic conditions  including higher gas costs  could cause these customers to use alternative sources of energy such as electricity or to bypass our systems in favor of special competitive contracts with lower per unit costs 
highlights on december   we completed the acquisition of mississippi valley gas company mvg  a privately held utility  for approximately million  which consisted of approximately million in cash and  unregistered shares of our common stock 
in addition  we paid approximately million to repay outstanding debt of mvg 
our mississippi valley gas company division provides natural gas distribution service to approximately  residential  industrial and other customers located primarily in the northern and central regions of mississippi 
in january  as a result of the adoption of eitf which precludes mark to market accounting for our natural gas marketing segment inventory and energy trading contracts that are not derivatives  we recorded a one time noncash charge for a cumulative effect adjustment of million million  net of income tax benefit on the consolidated statements of income 
on january   we issued million of senior notes due the net proceeds were used to repay debt under a short term acquisition credit facility used to partially finance the mvg acquisition  to repay million in unsecured senior notes held by institutional lenders  short term debt under our commercial paper program and to provide funds for general corporate purposes 
on june   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock  and we sold an additional  shares of our common stock in july when our underwriters exercised their overallotment option collectively referred to as the offering 
the offering was priced at per share and generated net proceeds of approximately million 
the proceeds were used to partially fund our pension plan  to repay short term debt and to fund general corporate purposes including the purchase of natural gas for storage 
in june  we contributed to the atmos energy corporation master retirement trust for the benefit of the atmos energy corporation pension account plan million in cash and  shares of atmos restricted common stock with a value of million 
the cash contribution was financed through a combination of cash on hand and a portion of the net proceeds received from the offering 
as a result of this contribution and improved investment returns on the assets used to fund the pension plan  the million minimum pension liability recognized during fiscal was eliminated in fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements were prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and the related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
we based our estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to risk management and trading activities  allowance for doubtful accounts  legal and environmental accruals  insurance accruals  pension and postretirement obligations  deferred income taxes and the valuation of goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other long lived assets 
our critical accounting policies are reviewed by the audit committee on a quarterly basis 
actual results may differ from estimates 
regulation our utility operations are subject to regulation with respect to rates  service  maintenance of accounting records and various other matters by the respective regulatory authorities in the states in which we operate 
our regulated utility operations are accounted for in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation 
this statement requires cost based  rate regulated entities that meet certain criteria to reflect the financial effects of the ratemaking and accounting practices and policies of the various regulatory commissions in their financial statements 
we record regulatory assets for costs that have been deferred for which future recovery through customer rates is considered probable 
regulatory liabilities are recorded when it is probable that revenues will be reduced for amounts that will be credited to customers through the ratemaking process 
as a result  certain costs that would normally be expensed under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states are permitted to be capitalized because they can be recovered through rates 
further  regulation may impact the period in which revenues or expenses are recognized 
the amounts to be recovered or recognized are based upon historical experience and our understanding of the regulations 
the impact of regulation on our utility operations may be affected by decisions of the regulatory authorities or the issuance of new regulations 
revenue recognition sales of natural gas to our utility customers are billed on a monthly cycle basis  however  the billing cycle periods for certain classes of customers do not necessarily coincide with accounting periods used for financial reporting purposes 
we follow the revenue accrual method of accounting for utility segment revenues whereby revenues applicable to gas delivered to customers  but not yet billed under the cycle billing method  are estimated and accrued and the related costs are charged to expense 
energy trading contracts resulting in the delivery of a commodity where we are the principal in the transaction are recorded as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time of physical delivery 
realized gains and losses from the settlement of financial instruments that do not result in physical delivery related to our natural gas marketing energy trading contracts and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the market value of open contracts are included as a component of natural gas marketing revenues 
allowance for doubtful accounts for the majority of our receivables  we establish an allowance for doubtful accounts based on an aging of those receivable balances 
we apply percentages to each aging category based on our collections experience 
on certain other receivables where we are aware of a specific customer s inability or reluctance to pay  we record an allowance for doubtful accounts against amounts due to reduce the net receivable balance to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
however  if circumstances change  our estimate of the recoverability of accounts receivable could be different 
circumstances which could affect our estimates include  but are not limited to  customer credit issues  the level of natural gas prices and general economic conditions 
derivatives and hedging activities we use a combination of storage and financial hedges to protect us and our natural gas utility customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases 
further  aem manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixed price purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of gas futures  including forwards  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
our financial hedges are accounted for under the mark to market method pursuant to sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
changes in the valuation of assets and liabilities arising from risk management activities primarily result from changes in the valuation of the portfolio of contracts  maturity and settlement of contracts and newly originated transactions 
market prices and models used to value these transactions reflect our best estimates considering various factors including closing exchange and over the counter quotations  time value and volatility factors underlying the contracts 
values are adjusted to reflect the potential impact of an orderly liquidation of our positions over a reasonable period of time under present market conditions 
changes in market prices and other assumptions used in these models directly affect our estimate of the fair value of these transactions 
however  because the costs of financial instruments used in our utility segment will ultimately be recovered through our rates  current period changes in the assets and liabilities from these risk management activities are recorded as a component of deferred gas costs in accordance with sfas accordingly  there is no earnings impact to our utility segment as a result of the use of financial instruments 
the changes in the assets and liabilities from risk management activities are recognized in purchased gas cost in the income statement when the related costs are recovered through our rates 
in the management of natural gas requirements for municipalities and other local utilities  aem sells physical natural gas to customers for future delivery 
over the counter swap agreements require aem to receive or make payments based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price of natural gas on the settlement date 
options held to manage price risk provide the right  but not the obligation  to buy or sell energy commodities at a fixed price 
aem links these financial derivatives to physical delivery of natural gas and typically balances its derivative positions at the end of each trading day 
however  at any point in time  aem may not have completely offset its risk on these activities 
aem s physical trading activities involve utilizing physical assets storage and transportation to sell and deliver gas to customers or to take a position in the market based on anticipated price movement 
in addition to the price risk of any net open position at the end of each trading day  the financial exposure that results from intra day fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements constitutes a risk of loss since the price of natural gas purchased or sold for future delivery at the beginning of the day may not be hedged until later in the day 
impairment assessments we perform impairment assessments of our goodwill  intangible assets subject to amortization and long lived assets 
we currently have no indefinite lived intangible assets 
we annually evaluate our goodwill balances for impairment during our second fiscal quarter or as impairment indicators arise 
we use a present value technique based on discounted cash flows to estimate the fair value of our reporting units 
our reporting units and our operating segments are the same as each operating unit represents a component of our business 
goodwill is allocated to the reporting units responsible for the acquisition that gave rise to the goodwill 
the discounted cash flow calculations used to assess goodwill impairment are dependent on several subjective factors including the timing of future cash flows  future growth rates  and the discount rate 
an impairment charge is recognized if the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its fair value 
we periodically evaluate whether events or circumstances have occurred that indicate that our intangible assets subject to amortization and other long lived assets may not be recoverable or that the remaining useful life may warrant revision 
when such events or circumstances are present  we assess the recoverability of these assets by determining whether the carrying value will be recovered through expected future cash flows 
these cash flow projections consider various factors such as the timing of the future cash flows and the discount rate and are based upon the best information available at the time the estimate is made 
changes in these factors could materially affect the cash flow projections and result in the recognition of an impairment charge 
an impairment charge is recognized as the difference between the carrying amount and the fair value if the sum of the undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying value of the related asset 
pension and other postretirement plans pension and other postretirement plan expenses and liabilities are determined on an actuarial basis and are affected by the market value of plan assets  estimates of the expected return on plan assets and assumed discount rates and demographic data 
the assumed return on plan assets is based on management s expectation of the long term return on the portfolio of plan assets 
the discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets and differences between the actual return on plan assets and the expected return on plan assets could have a material effect on the amount of pension expense ultimately recognized 
results of operations the primary factors that impact our results of utility operations are seasonal weather patterns  competitive factors in the energy industry and economic conditions in our service areas 
natural gas sales to residential  commercial and public authority customers are affected by winter heating season requirements 
this generally results in higher operating revenues and net income during the period from october through march of each year and lower operating revenues and either lower net income or net losses during the period from april through september of each year 
accordingly  our second fiscal quarter historically has been our most critical earnings quarter with an average of percent of our net income having been earned in the second quarter during the three most recently completed fiscal years 
utility sales to industrial customers are much less weather sensitive 
utility sales to agricultural customers  who typically use natural gas to power irrigation pumps during the period from march through september  are primarily affected by rainfall amounts and the price of natural gas 
changes in the cost of gas impact revenue but do not directly affect our gross profit from utility operations because the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to the customer 
our natural gas marketing segment generates income from its industrial  utility and municipal customers through negotiated prices based on the volume of gas supplied to the customer 
it also generates income by utilizing storage and transportation capacity that it controls to take advantage of the difference between near term gas prices and prices for future delivery as well as the daily movement of gas prices 
the following table presents our financial highlights for the three fiscal years ended september  for the year ended september in thousands  unless otherwise noted operating revenues    gross profit    operating expenses    operating income    other income expense    interest charges    income before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change    cumulative effect of accounting change  net of income tax benefit  income tax expense    net income    utility sales volumes mmcf    utility transportation volumes mmcf    total utility throughput mmcf    natural gas marketing sales volumes mmcf    heating degree days actual weighted average    percent of normal consolidated utility average sales price per mcf consolidated utility average transportation revenue per mcf consolidated utility average cost of gas per mcf sold the following table reconciles the gross profit and throughput information from a segment basis  before intercompany eliminations  to a consolidated basis for the year ended september in thousands  unless otherwise noted utility segment gross profit    intersegment activity    utility segment contribution to consolidated gross profit    natural gas marketing segment gross profit    intersegment activity natural gas marketing segment contribution to consolidated gross profit    other non utility segment gross profit    intersegment activity    other non utility segment contribution to consolidated gross profit    utility segment throughput mmcf    intersegment activity mmcf   consolidated utility segment throughput mmcf    natural gas marketing segment throughput mmcf    intersegment activity mmcf    consolidated natural gas marketing segment throughput mmcf    year ended september  compared with year ended september  gross profit utility segment gross profit for our utility segment primarily consists of gas service margins generated by our six utility operating divisions from the sale of natural gas to approximately million residential  commercial  industrial  agricultural and other customers in the states that comprise our utility service areas 
utility gross profit increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  total throughput for our utility business was billion cubic feet bcf during the current year compared to bcf in the prior year 
the increase in utility gross profit and total throughput was primarily attributable to the impact of the mvg acquisition in december  which increased utility gross profit and total throughput by million and bcf 
the increase in utility gross profit was also attributable to a million increase in our base charges primarily in louisiana as a result of our annual rate stabilization clause filing which became effective in november these increases were partially offset by a million decrease in revenues from the impact of wna as a result of weather in our wna service areas being percent colder than normal for the year ended september  the average cost of gas per mcf sold increased percent to for from for  resulting in a percent increase in average sales price 
however  changes in the cost of gas do not directly affect utility gross profit because the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to the customer 
natural gas marketing segment gross profit for our natural gas marketing segment consists primarily of the difference between revenue arising from the sale of physical natural gas to our natural gas marketing customers less the cost to purchase natural gas and unrealized gains and losses from changes in the market value of open contracts 
our natural gas marketing gross profit was million for the year ended september  compared to gross profit of million for the year ended september  natural gas marketing sales volumes were bcf during the current year compared to bcf for the prior year 
our natural gas marketing gross profit included an unrealized gain on open contracts of million compared with an unrealized loss on open contracts of million last year 
natural gas marketing gross profit for the year ended september  decreased as we purchased gas during a period of rising prices to meet our contractual requirements with our customers due to several factors 
we anticipated a decline in natural gas prices during the period december through march  therefore  we elected to keep gas in storage and to buy flowing gas to meet our customer needs during that period 
we were also unable to withdraw planned volumes from storage to meet our non utility customer needs due to contractual and regulatory limitations relating to our storage facilities 
additionally  we experienced situations of open short positions and were not sufficiently hedged on other transactions  which contributed to the decrease in our natural gas marketing gross profit 
finally  we recognized smaller gains from inventory sales in the current year as compared with the prior year 
since the winter heating season  we have taken steps to minimize any future negative impact of the events that caused the lower than expected earnings from our natural gas marketing segment during the year 
in july  we entered into a contract for one bcf of capacity in a salt dome storage facility that will help us to manage our price risk related to customer demand volatility 
this facility provides increased flexibility to satisfy changing customer demands because it allows us to inject and withdraw gas on a daily and monthly basis 
the contract commenced in november and will remain in effect for the next five heating seasons 
annual lease payments will be approximately million 
additionally  we are amending our contracts with third parties  where possible  to transfer usage risk to our customers and to provide higher margins 
finally  we are reviewing our internal processes to improve the effectiveness of our overall risk management and financial reporting processes 
other non utility segment our other non utility segment gross profit primarily consists of margins generated by our third party storage services and our leasing operations 
our other non utility segment contributed million in gross profit during the current year compared with million for the prior year 
the increase in our non utility gross profit was primarily attributable to increased asset management activities in the current year and an increase in leasing income attributable to the commencement in of a new lease for a distributed electric generation plant 
other consolidated activity operating expenses operating expenses  which include operation and maintenance expense  provision for doubtful accounts  depreciation and amortization expense and taxes other than income taxes  increased percent to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  operation and maintenance expense increased primarily due to the addition of million related to the mvg acquisition in december and a million increase in the provision for doubtful accounts as a result of higher revenues and gas prices 
this increase was partially offset by a million reduction in labor costs attributable to lower incentive payment accruals as compared with the prior year 
taxes other than income taxes increased million primarily due to additional franchise  payroll and property taxes associated with the mvg assets acquired in december note that franchise and state gross receipts taxes are paid by our customers  thus  these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no effect on net income 
other income expense other income for the year ended september  was million  compared with an expense of million for the year ended september  the million change was primarily attributable to a million gain associated with a sales type lease of a distributed electric generation plant which was recognized in the first quarter of and improved earnings from our indirect investment in heritage propane lp  partially offset by a million charge associated with the cancellation of our weather insurance policy during the third quarter of fiscal interest charges interest charges increased eight percent for the year ended september  to million from million for the year ended september  the increase was primarily attributable to a higher average outstanding debt balance resulting from the financing obtained to fund the acquisition of mvg 
cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on january   we recorded a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle to reflect a change in the way we account for our storage and transportation contracts 
previously we accounted for those contracts under eitf  accounting for energy trading and risk management activities  which required us to record estimated future gains on our storage and transportation contracts at the time we entered into the contracts and to mark those contracts to market value each month 
effective january   we no longer mark those contracts to market 
as a result  we expensed million  net of applicable income tax benefit  as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
year ended september  compared with year ended september  gross profit utility segment gross profit for our utility segment increased six percent to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  total throughput for  excluding louisiana gas service company s throughput  was bcf compared with bcf for the increase in utility gross profit was due primarily to the gross profit earned from additional throughput of bcf from the louisiana gas service operations acquired in july this increase was offset by the effect of warmer weather  which resulted in a percent decrease in gas sales volumes excluding louisiana gas service s gas sales volumes 
during  temperatures were percent warmer than the prior year and were six percent warmer than the year normal  adjusted for service areas with weather normalized operations 
the average cost of gas per mcf sold decreased percent to for from for  resulting in a percent decrease in average sales price 
however  changes in the cost of gas do not directly affect gross profit because the fluctuations in gas prices are passed through to the customer 
natural gas marketing segment gross profit for our natural gas marketing segment was million for the year ended september  compared to gross profit of million for the year ended september  natural gas marketing sales volumes were bcf during the current year compared to bcf for the prior year 
the increase for compared to was primarily due to gains on inventory sales and favorable pricing under natural gas sales contracts as well as our full consolidation of woodward marketing llc beginning april when we completed our acquisition of the remaining percent interest in woodward marketing  llc that we did not already own 
since the acquisition  the revenues and expenses of woodward marketing llc have been shown on a consolidated basis 
other non utility segment our other non utility segment contributed million in gross profit during the current year compared with million for the prior year 
other consolidated activity operating expenses operating expenses increased to million for the year ended september  from million for the year ended september  operation and maintenance expense increased primarily due to the addition of million relating to the louisiana gas service acquisition in july and an increase of million in pension costs 
in addition  operation and maintenance expense increased million due to the full consolidation of woodward marketing s operations beginning april  a decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts of million partially offset this increase 
the decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts was attributable to the lower gas commodity prices during as well as our effective recovery of customer receivable balances 
depreciation and amortization increased million due to the addition of the assets from the louisiana gas service acquisition in july taxes other than income decreased as a result of decreased city franchise taxes and state gross receipts taxes  which are revenue based 
however  these taxes are paid by our customers  thus  these amounts are offset in revenues through customer billings and have no effect on net income 
the decrease in taxes other than income was partially offset by increases in property and payroll taxes related to the louisiana gas service acquisition in july miscellaneous expense miscellaneous expense decreased million to million in compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to an increase in net recoveries related to our performance based ratemaking mechanisms  the recognition of million related to a large industrial contract we received during and a reduction in the amortization expense recognized related to weather insurance purchased for the heating season 
in addition  we had an increase of million in interest income in may due primarily to interest income earned on the proceeds from our million debt offering in we invested these proceeds in short term investments until the completion of the louisiana gas service acquisition in july no such interest income was recognized in interest expense interest expense increased million to million for compared to million for this increase was due primarily to the interest expense on the million debt offering in may liquidity and capital resources our working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures and other cash needs are provided from internally generated funds  borrowings under our credit facilities and commercial paper program and funds raised from the public debt and equity capital markets 
we believe that these sources of funds will provide the necessary working capital and liquidity for capital expenditures and other cash needs for fiscal capitalization the following presents our capitalization as of september  and september in thousands  except percentages short term debt   long term debt   shareholders equity   total capitalization  including short term debt   total debt as a percentage of total capitalization  including short term debt  was percent and percent at september  and the improvement in the debt to capitalization ratio was primarily attributable to the issuance of common stock in connection with our offering and the mvg acquisition as well as the elimination of the minimum pension liability as of september  due to increased funding of our pension plan and improved investment returns on the assets used to fund the pension plan 
our long term plan is to maintain the debt to capitalization ratio within a target range of percent through cash flow generated from operations  continued issuance of new common stock under our direct stock purchase plan and retirement savings plan  access to the debt and equity capital markets and limiting annual maintenance and capital expenditures 
cash flows our internally generated funds may change in the future due to a number of factors  some of which we cannot control 
these include regulatory changes  the price for our products and services  the demand for such products and services  margin requirements resulting from significant changes in commodity prices  operational risks and other factors 
cash flows from operating activities for the year ended september   we generated operating cash flow of million compared with million in fiscal and million in fiscal the significant factors impacting our operating cash flow for the last three fiscal years are summarized below 
year ended september  fiscal operating cash flow was adversely impacted by a million increase in accounts receivable due to higher revenues and the timing of customer account collections 
the increase in revenues is attributable to a percent increase in consolidated utility throughput as a result of the impact of our mvg acquisition and a percent increase in average utility sales price per mcf primarily due to an increase in natural gas costs 
operating cash flow was also adversely impacted by a significant increase in natural gas prices 
these increases resulted in a million increase in gas stored underground and a million increase in deferred gas costs 
finally  operating cash flow reflects the impact of the funding of our pension plan in june  which included a million cash payment 
this funding is discussed under the caption pension and postretirement benefits obligations below 
year ended september  in fiscal  operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a million reduction in cash held on deposit in margin accounts 
this account represents deposits recorded to collateralize certain of our financial derivatives purchased in support of our natural gas marketing activities and will fluctuate based upon the timing of our derivative activities 
operating cash flow was also favorably impacted by a million increase in accounts payable and accrued liabilities and a million increase in other current liabilities primarily attributable to the timing of payments as compared with the prior year 
finally  operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a million decrease in deferred gas costs reflecting the favorable timing between the billing of gas costs to our customers and the purchase of natural gas 
these favorable impacts were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable 
this increase was attributable to revenue increases resulting from the inclusion of the lgs and woodward marketing operations for a full year and the timing of customer account collections 
year ended september  in fiscal  operating cash flow was favorably impacted by a million decrease in accounts receivable attributable to improved customer collections during fiscal and a million decrease in deferred gas costs reflecting the favorable timing between the billing of gas costs to our customers and the purchase of natural gas 
these favorable impacts were partially offset by the million deposit of cash into margin accounts to collateralize certain of our financial derivatives and a million decrease in accounts payable and accrued liabilities attributable to the timing of payments as compared with the prior year

in fiscal  we issued million of senior notes due in and received net proceeds of million 
the net proceeds were used to finance the acquisition of the assets of louisiana gas service company

fiscal and payments were million and million 
during fiscal  we paid million in cash dividends compared with dividend payments of million and million for fiscal and the increase in dividends paid over the preceding two years reflects increases in the quarterly dividend rate and the number of shares outstanding

additionally  as noted above  we sold  shares of our common stock in connection with our offering under the registration statement 
after the debt offering and these common stock sales  approximately million remains available under the shelf registration statement 
credit facilities we maintain both committed and uncommitted credit facilities 
our credit capacity and the amount of unused borrowing capacity are affected by the seasonal nature of the natural gas business and our short term borrowing requirements  which are typically highest during colder months 
our working capital needs can vary significantly due to changes in the price of natural gas charged by suppliers and the increased gas supplies required to meet customers needs during periods of cold weather 
committed credit facilities we have two short term committed credit facilities totaling million 
the first short term unsecured credit facility is for million  bears interest at the eurodollar rate plus percent and serves as a backup liquidity facility for our commercial paper program 
this facility was renewed in july with a million increase in the amount of the facility under substantially the same terms as those of the prior facility 
this facility will expire in july at september   million of commercial paper was outstanding  and atmos energy corporation letters of credit reduced the amount available by an additional million 
we have a second unsecured facility in place for million that bears interest at the fed funds rate plus percent 
at september   there were no borrowings under this credit facility 
these credit facilities are negotiated at least annually and are used for working capital purposes 
on october   we entered into a million short term unsecured committed credit facility 
this credit facility was used to provide initial funding for the cash portion of the mvg acquisition and to repay mvg s existing debt 
a total of million was borrowed under this credit facility during the first quarter 
this amount was refinanced in january with a portion of the proceeds of our million debt offering  as discussed above 
the availability of funds under our credit facilities is subject to conditions specified therein  which we currently meet 
these conditions include our compliance with financial covenants and the continued accuracy of representations and warranties contained in these agreements 
we are required by the financial covenants in our million credit facility to maintain a ratio of total debt to total capitalization of no greater than percent 
at september   our total debt to total capitalization ratio  as defined  was percent 
uncommitted credit facilities our woodward marketing subsidiary has a million uncommitted demand working capital credit facility that bears interest at libor plus percent 
atmos energy holdings  inc aeh and atmos energy marketing  llc  our wholly owned subsidiaries  are guarantors of all amounts outstanding under this facility 
effective october  with the reorganization of our natural gas marketing segment  aem became the borrower under the credit facility and aeh became the sole guarantor of the facility 
at september   no amount was outstanding under this credit facility  although woodward marketing  llc letters of credit totaling million reduced the amount available 
the amount available under this credit facility is also limited by various covenants  including covenants based on working capital 
under the most restrictive covenant  the amount available to woodward marketing under this credit facility at september  was million 
this credit facility expires on march  and is expected to be renewed at that time 
we also have an unsecured short term uncommitted credit line for million 
there were no borrowings under this uncommitted credit facility at september  this uncommitted line is renewed or renegotiated at least annually with varying terms and we pay no fee for the availability of the line 
borrowings under this line are made on a when and as available basis at the discretion of the bank 
this facility is also used for working capital purposes 
in october  we increased the amount of this credit line to million 
in addition  woodward marketing has a million intercompany credit facility with aeh for its non utility business which bore interest at libor plus percent through july when the interest rate was increased to libor plus percent 
any outstanding amounts under this facility are subordinated to woodward marketing s million uncommitted demand credit facility described above 
at september   million was outstanding under this facility 
credit rating our credit ratings directly affect our ability to obtain short term and long term financing  in addition to the cost of such financing 
in determining our credit ratings  the rating agencies consider a number of quantitative factors  including debt to total capitalization  operating cash flow relative to outstanding debt  operating cash flow coverage of interest and pension liabilities and funding status 
in addition  the rating agencies consider qualitative factors such as consistency of our earnings over time  the quality of our management and business strategy  the risk associated with our utility and non utility businesses and the regulatory structures that govern our rates in the states where we operate 
our debt is rated by three rating agencies standard poor s corporation s p  moody s investors service moody s and fitch ratings  inc fitch 
our current debt ratings are as follows s p moody s fitch long term debt a a a commercial paper a p f our credit ratings may be revised or withdrawn at any time by the rating agencies  and each rating should be evaluated independently of any other rating 
there can be no assurance that a rating will remain in effect for any given period of time or that a rating will not be lowered  or withdrawn entirely  by a rating agency if  in its judgment  circumstances so warrant 
on january   s p changed the outlook on our long term debt rating from stable to negative 
in its press release explaining this action  s p cited  among other factors  their concern that we have not made significant progress in reducing our debt to total capitalization ratio 
since s p changed its outlook  we have issued equity and substantially reduced our leverage 
moody s and fitch each continue to maintain a stable outlook for our ratings 
we have no trigger events in our debt instruments that are tied to changes in specified credit ratings or stock price  nor have we entered into any transactions that would require us to issue equity based on our credit rating or other trigger events 
debt covenants in addition to the limit on our total debt to capitalization ratio imposed by our committed credit facilities described above  our first mortgage bonds provide for certain cash flow requirements and restrictions on additional indebtedness  sale of assets and payment of dividends 
under the most restrictive of such covenants  cumulative cash dividends paid after december  may not exceed the sum of accumulated net income for periods after december  plus million 
at september   approximately million of retained earnings was unrestricted 
we are in compliance with all of our debt covenants as of september  contractual obligations and commercial commitments the following tables provide information about contractual obligations and commercial commitments at september  payments due by period less than after total year years years years in thousands contractual obligations long term debt      capital lease obligations    operating leases      total contractual obligations      other commercial commitments lines of credit   aem has commitments to purchase physical quantities of natural gas under contracts indexed to the forward nymex strip or fixed price contracts 
at september   aem was committed to purchase bcf within one year and bcf between to years under indexed contracts 
aem was committed to purchase bcf within one year under fixed price contracts with prices ranging from to 
aem s fixed price contracts are marked to market as derivatives 
see further discussion of the fixed price contracts under risk management and trading activities 
our utility segment maintains supply contracts with several vendors that generally cover a period of up to one year 
commitments for estimated base gas volumes are established under these contracts on a monthly basis at contractually negotiated prices 
commitments for incremental daily purchases are made as necessary during the month in accordance with the terms of the individual contract 
pension and postretirement benefits obligations in june  we contributed to the atmos energy corporation master retirement trust for the benefit of the atmos energy corporation pension account plan million in cash and  shares of atmos restricted common stock with a value of million 
of the total cash contributed  million represented a contribution  which was deducted on our tax return 
the cash contribution was financed through a combination of cash on hand and a portion of the net proceeds received from the sale of  shares of our common stock in our offering 
as a result of this contribution and improved investment returns during fiscal  the underfunded status of the plan improved by approximately million  and the million reduction to equity recorded in the prior year was eliminated as of september  we recorded the million reduction in equity at september  as a result of negative investment returns from plan assets during fiscal  lump sum distributions to participants and a decrease in interest rates 
refer to note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our pension plans 
for the fiscal year ended september   our pension cost was million compared with pension income of million and million for the fiscal years ended september  and pension income and expense is recorded as a component of operation and maintenance expense 
we incurred pension cost during fiscal compared with income in fiscal due to an increase in the service cost and interest cost attributable to an increase in the projected benefit obligation 
the increase in the projected benefit obligation resulted primarily from an increase in the number of plan participants due to the mvg acquisition and an increase attributable to a basis point decrease in the discount rate used in the fiscal actuarial calculations reflecting the decline in market interest rates 
the decrease in pension income between fiscal and was attributable to increases in service cost and interest costs due to increases in the projected benefit obligations coupled with a decrease in the expected return on assets due to poor investment performance 
the projected pension liability  future funding requirements and the amount of pension expense or income recognized for the plan are subject to change  depending upon the actuarial value of plan assets and the determination of future benefit obligations as of each subsequent actuarial calculation date 
these amounts are impacted by actual investment returns  changes in interest rates and changes in the demographic composition of the participants in the plan 
the actuarial assumptions used to determine the pension liability for our pension plan are as follows discount rate rate of compensation increase expected return on plan assets the assumed return on plan assets is based on management s expectation of the long term return on the portfolio of plan assets 
the discount rate used to compute the present value of plan liabilities generally is based on rates of high grade corporate bonds with maturities similar to the average period over which benefits will be paid 
these rates have declined since fiscal due to a decline in interest rates and poor market performance of the underlying plan assets 
the rate of compensation increase is established based upon our internal budgets 
at this time  we anticipate that additional voluntary contributions ranging from million during fiscal may be necessary to keep the plan funded on an accumulated benefit obligation basis 
risk management and trading activities we conduct our risk management activities through both our utility and natural gas marketing segments 
the following table shows our risk management assets and liabilities by segment at september  natural gas utility marketing total in thousands assets from risk management activities  current   assets from risk management activities  noncurrent   liabilities from risk management activities  current    liabilities from risk management activities  noncurrent net assets liabilities    utility hedging activities our utility segment s hedging activities are designed to protect us and our customers against unusually large winter period gas price increases and include the use of financial hedges and fixed forward contracts 
for the heating season  we covered approximately percent of our anticipated flowing gas requirements through a combination of storage  financial hedges and fixed forward contracts at a weighted average cost of less than per mcf 
this provided a measure of protection to us and our customers against the natural gas price volatility experienced during the heating season 
for the heating season  we expect to hedge between percent and percent of our anticipated flowing gas requirements through a combination of storage and financial hedges at a weighted average cost of approximately per mcf 
in june  we purchased a three year weather insurance policy with an option to cancel the third year of coverage 
the insurance was designed for our texas and louisiana operations to protect against weather that was at least seven percent warmer than normal for the entire heating season of october through march beginning with the heating season 
the cost of the three year policy was million  which was prepaid and amortized over the appropriate heating seasons based on degree days 
because weather was not at least seven percent warmer than normal  no income was recognized under this insurance policy during the years ended september  and amortization expense of million and million was recognized during the fiscal years ended september  and included in the amortization expense for the fiscal year ended september  was a third quarter charge of million  net of cash received  related to the cancellation of the third year of coverage on our weather insurance policy primarily as a result of rate relief in louisiana  wna in certain areas of texas and prospects for wna in other areas of texas 
non utility hedging activities our natural gas marketing segment hedging activities are conducted through aem and are designed to manage margins on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixed price purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of gas futures  including forwards  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
on october   the emerging issues task force eitf issued eitf  accounting for contracts involved in energy trading and risk management  which rescinded eitf  accounting for energy trading and risk management activities  and required that all energy trading contracts entered into after october  be accounted for pursuant to the provisions of sfas  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
prior to the issuance of eitf  we accounted for all energy trading contracts under the mark to market method in accordance with eitf with the adoption of eitf  our inventory  storage  transportation and index priced physical forward contracts are no longer marked to market 
our index priced physical forward contracts are now considered normal purchases and sales under sfas accordingly  the carrying value of these contracts was frozen as of january  and will be recognized in earnings concurrent with delivery under the contracts 
we recognized a charge for the cumulative effect of accounting change of million  net of income tax benefit  upon the adoption of eitf in the second quarter of fiscal fixed price contracts generally continue to be marked to market 
in conjunction with the adoption of eitf  energy trading contracts resulting in delivery of a commodity where we are the principal in the transaction are included as natural gas marketing sales or purchases at the time of delivery 
the following table shows the components of the change in fair value of our utility and natural gas marketing derivative contract activities for the year ended september  in thousands 
natural gas utility marketing fair value of contracts at september    contracts realized settled   fair value of new contracts   other changes in value  cumulative effect of accounting change  fair value of contracts at september    the fair value of our utility and natural gas marketing derivative contracts at september   is segregated below  by time period and fair value source

in addition to the price risk of any net open position at the end of each trading day  the financial exposure that results from intra day fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements constitutes a risk of loss since the price of natural gas purchased or sold for future delivery at the beginning of the day may not be hedged until later in the day 
these trading activities are subject to a risk management policy which limits the level of trading loss to a maximum of percent of the budgeted annual operating income of atmos energy holdings 
compliance with this risk management policy is monitored on a daily basis 
in addition  the risk management policy limits woodward marketing s gas daily daily and nymex positions with price risk  including inventory  open positions to a total volume of bcf 
we manage our business to maintain no open positions 
however  at times  limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a short term basis 
woodward marketing monitors its open trading positions daily to ensure they are within the limits set by the risk management policy 
at september   woodward s net open positions in its trading operations totaled bcf 
recent accounting developments in may  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas establishes standards for the classification and measurement of certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
under sfas  mandatorily redeemable financial instruments  obligations to repurchase the issuer s shares by transferring assets and certain obligations to issue a variable number of shares to settle that obligation  must be classified as liabilities on the balance sheet and initially recorded at fair value 
sfas is effective for the company for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and on july  for most previously existing financial instruments 
in november  the fasb voted to defer indefinitely the effective date for certain mandatorily redeemable non controlling interests mrni associated with finite lived subsidiaries 
for all other mrnis  the effective date was deferred to november  the adoption of sfas did not impact our financial position  results of operations or net cash flows as we currently do not use any of the financial instruments subject to this statement 
in april  the fasb issued sfas  amendment of statement on derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas amends and clarifies the accounting and reporting for derivative instruments  including hedges 
this statement amends sfas for decisions made by the derivatives implementation group and by the fasb in connection with other projects dealing with financial instruments  and clarifies other implementation issues 
sfas is effective for the company on a prospective basis for contracts entered into or modified after june  the adoption of this statement did not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or net cash flows 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on how to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities vie and how to determine when and which business enterprises should consolidate the vie 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin applies immediately to vies created after january  or to vies obtained after that date 
for variable interests held in vies acquired prior to february   fin was originally effective july  however  in october  the fasb deferred the effective date of fin for vies created prior to february  to the first reporting period after december  the adoption of this interpretation will not have a material impact on our financial position  results of operations or net cash flows because atmos currently is not a primary beneficiary of a vie 
in december  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for stock based compensation 
sfas provides three transition options for companies that account for stock based compensation under the intrinsic method to convert to the fair value method 
sfas also modified the disclosure requirements for stock based compensation to increase the prominence and character of the pro forma disclosures for entities using the intrinsic value method 
although we have elected to continue using the intrinsic value method  we adopted the disclosure requirements prescribed by sfas in november  the fasb issued fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin clarifies the requirements of sfas accounting for obligations  relating to a guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
the adoption of fin did not impact our financial position  results of operations or net cash flows as we currently do not have any guarantees that meet the recognition and disclosure criteria outlined in this pronouncement 
in june  the fasb issued sfas  accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs 
effective october   we adopted sfas  which had no material impact on our financial position or results of operations based on the perpetual nature of our franchise agreements and on our experience in the businesses in which we operate 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the risk inherent in our market risk sensitive instruments is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in natural gas commodity prices and interest rates as discussed below 
the sensitivity analysis does not  however  consider the effects that such adverse changes may have on overall economic activity nor do they consider additional actions we may take to mitigate exposure to such changes 
actual results may differ 
gas prices utility segment we purchase natural gas for our utility operations 
substantially all of the cost of gas purchased for utility operations is recovered from our customers through purchased gas adjustment mechanisms 
the utility segment has limited market risk in gas prices related to gas purchases in the open market at spot prices for sale to non regulated energy services customers at fixed prices 
as a result  our earnings could be affected by changes in the price and availability of such gas 
to protect against volatility in gas prices  we hedge our gas costs by purchasing futures contracts and by purchasing gas in advance of the winter heating season and placing it in storage 
our utility segment does not use such financial instruments for trading purposes and we are not a party to any leveraged derivatives 
market risk is estimated as a hypothetical percent increase in the portion of our gas cost related to fixed price non regulated sales 
based on projected fiscal non regulated gas sales at fixed prices based upon the september  three month market strip  such an increase would result in an increase to cost of gas of approximately million in fiscal natural gas marketing segment the principal business of aem  including the activities of woodward marketing  llc and trans louisiana industrial gas company  inc  is the overall management of natural gas requirements for municipalities  local gas utility companies and industrial customers located primarily in the southeastern and midwestern united states 
aem also supplies our regulated operations with a portion of our natural gas requirements on a competitive bid basis 
in the management of natural gas requirements for municipalities and other local utilities  aem sells physical natural gas to customers for future delivery 
aem manages margins and limits risk exposure on the sale of natural gas inventory or the offsetting fixed price purchase or sale commitments for physical quantities of natural gas through the use of gas futures  including forwards  over the counter and exchange traded options and swap contracts with counterparties 
over the counter swap agreements require aem to receive or make payments based on the difference between a fixed price and the market price of natural gas on the settlement date 
options held to manage price risk provide the right  but not the requirement  to buy or sell energy commodities at a fixed price 
aem links these gas futures to physical delivery of natural gas and typically balances its futures positions at the end of each trading day 
however  at any point in time  aem may not have completely offset its risk on these activities 
physical trading involves utilizing physical assets storage and transportation to sell and deliver gas to customers or to take a position in the market based on anticipated price movement 
in addition to the price risk of any net open position at the end of each trading day  the financial exposure that results from intra day fluctuations of gas prices and the potential for daily price movements constitutes a risk of loss since the price of natural gas purchased or sold for future delivery at the beginning of the day may not be hedged until later in the day 
these trading activities are subject to a risk management policy which limits the level of trading loss to a maximum of percent of the budgeted annual operating income of atmos energy holdings 
compliance with this risk management policy is monitored on a daily basis 
in addition  the risk management policy limits woodward marketing s gas daily daily and nymex positions with price risk  including inventory  open positions to a total volume of bcf 
we manage our business to maintain no open positions 
however  at times  limited net open positions related to our physical storage may occur on a short term basis 
woodward marketing monitors its open trading positions daily to ensure they are within the limits set by the risk management policy 
at september   woodward s net open positions in its trading operations totaled bcf 
counterparty risk is the risk of loss from nonperformance by financial counterparties to a contract 
financial instruments  which subject aem to counterparty risk  consist primarily of financial instruments arising from trading and risk management activities and overnight repurchase agreements that are not insured 
exchange traded future and option contracts are generally guaranteed by the exchanges 
because aem s operations are concentrated in the natural gas industry  its customers and suppliers may be subject to economic risks affecting that industry 
therefore  an economic downturn in the industry could have an adverse affect on the creditworthiness of aem s customers 
aem manages credit risk to attempt to minimize its exposure to uncollectible receivables 
in compliance with aem s existing credit policy  prospective and existing customers are reviewed for creditworthiness and customers not meeting minimum standards  at the discretion of management  provide security deposits and are subject to various requisite secured payment terms 
during  aem s credit risk has increased due to higher natural gas prices as compared with the prior year 
however  this risk is somewhat mitigated because a larger percentage of our business in the current year is with municipal customers  who are typically rated investment grade  as compared with the prior year 
interest rates our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of our issuance of short term commercial paper and our other short term borrowings 
if market interest rates for short term borrowings in fiscal had averaged one percent more  our interest expense would have increased by approximately million 
market risk for fixed rate long term obligations is estimated as the potential increase in fair value resulting from a hypothetical one percent decrease in interest rates and amounts to approximately million based on discounted cash flow analyses 
as of september   we were not engaged in other activities which would cause exposure to the risk of material earnings or cash flow loss due to changes in interest rates or market commodity prices
