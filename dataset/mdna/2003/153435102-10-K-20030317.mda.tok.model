overview the following comments regarding variations in operating results should be read considering the rates of inflation in poland during the periods presented  and as well as the fluctuations of the polish zloty compared to the us dollar during these periods 
using exchanges rates at december   and  the zloty in comparison to the us dollar appreciated in  in and in in order to aid understanding  we have prepared tables which segment our income statement information as presented in the financial statements into those elements which relate to operations acquired during the reporting period and those which relate to operations owned in both reporting periods 
key definitions are total operations the total results as presented in our financial statements and which includes the consolidated results for the period for all subsidiaries owned in the respective year continuing operations the results for elements of the company which were owned for the same periods in both reported years core growth the growth rates achieved between results from continuing operations as reported in the current year versus the continuing operations of the previous year readers will also find frequent references to the term cash on delivery  or cod 
normal trade terms from our polish vodka suppliers are days  however  we are offered by some of these suppliers significant discounts off the invoice price if we pay for goods when delivered 
the discounts offered are considerably in excess of the effective rate we would pay for day term borrowings under our bank facilities 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  operations acquired include the first quarter results for astor  which was acquired on april  these results have been excluded from continuing operations to show the impact of a common nine month period of ownership of astor in continuing operations in both years

net sales from continuing operations increased by  or million  to million from million for the change of excise rates on polish vodka on october  had an adverse effect on our third quarter sales as our customers delayed purchases in anticipation of the reduction in excise rates 
we had anticipated being able to recover these sales as our customers reinstituted their purchases in the fourth quarter and as sales which we believe had previously been lost to unofficial channels began to be made through normal supply lines 
as a result of both the restocking by our customers and the migration of unofficial sales to normal channels  total net sales for the three months ended december  was million  as compared to million for the same period in  an increase of 
of this million in net sales  million relates to acquisitions and million from continuing operations  which represents a core growth rate year over year 
gross profit total gross profit on sales increased by or million 
when expressed as a percentage of sales  gross margins were for both years 
while core gross margins have increased to  the new businesses acquired in achieved a margin of 
because these newly acquired businesses contributed of the total gross profit  the lower margin achieved in these units had a dilutive effect on our total gross profit 
as we move forward into  the company expects to increase the margins in these acquired businesses as it rationalizes products and client portfolios 
the improvement in the margins from continuing operations can be attributed to the improved pricing terms reached with suppliers following the acquisitions of damianex and 
table of contents agis which  in turn  reflected back into the pre acquisition group  and to the company s ongoing program of migrating its client base from second tier distributors towards retailers and on premise accounts 
operating expenses total operations continuing operations operations acquired operations acquired total operations selling  general and administrative expenses as percentage of net sales bad debt expense as a percentage of net sales total selling  general and administrative expenses sg a increased from million in to million in when expressed as a percentage of net sales  total sg a decreased from for to for this improvement is attributable to both improvement in core sg a  which fell to  and to the significantly lower cost basis achieved by the new acquisitions which operate in provincial areas 
the reduction in core sg a has resulted from ongoing reviews of operations both in terms of staffing levels and in the choice of suppliers  and terms achieved on the delivery of goods and services to the whole group 
depreciation of fixed assets and equipment increased by from  in to million in the increase is attributable to the amount of assets acquired with damianex and agis 
on continuing operations  depreciation increased by  mainly due to the introduction of new business software in three of the subsidiaries 
amortization of goodwill and trade marks has decreased by  from  for to  for this reduction is primarily the result of the application of the requirements of fasb  which no longer allows the company to amortize goodwill  but instead requires companies to perform regular impairment reviews 
the company has performed an impairment review and concluded that no adjustment is required 
total bad debt expense increased  or  from  for to million for this increase was mainly attributable to continuing operations as the company has focused on the aging of its receivables in light of the current economic situation in poland

operating income total operating income increased  or million  to million for expressed as a percentage of net sales  total operating income for was compared to for operating income from continuing operations increased from million for to million for the significant increase in operating income is a direct result of the company s ability to leverage its size from both the buy side and the sell side of its gross margins 
in addition  the company has also been able to leverage its position on overhead reduction through centralizing contracts for items such as gasoline  insurance  leasing  trucks  telecommunications  office and warehouse supplies 
during the fourth quarter of  the company refined its inventory valuation method to better estimate direct costs incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location 
this change in estimate resulted in increasing operating income by approximately  interest expense total net interest expense increased  or  from million for to million for as a percentage of net sales  total interest fell from in to in interest cover  being the number of times interest expense is covered by operating income and calculated as operating income divided by interest expense  has increased from times in to times in during  interest 
table of contents rates fell significantly in poland from an average of in to in the company increased its debt level during primarily to fund its acquisitions of damianex  agis and onufry  which added million to long term debt 
as mentioned in the overview  the company makes extensive use of cod rebates when the discount offered is significantly better than the effective rate of bank borrowing 
while taking advantage of cod terms increases the company s short term borrowings and interest expense  we believe that the improvement in overall margins more than offsets the added interest cost 
net realized and unrealized foreign currency losses the net charge relating to foreign exchange losses increased to  for compared to a net charge of  for since  the company has tried to contain the foreign exchange risk on its non polish zloty denominated debt through the use of hedging instruments which as a rule are expensive in poland compared to more established markets 
in november  the company made the decision to migrate virtually all of its long term acquisition debt from us dollars and euro into polish zloty 
the company believes that the reduction in local interest rates justified this move as it also allowed the company to eliminate the main source of potential foreign exchange risks 
income tax the total tax charge for was million  which represented of pre tax profits 
for the charge was million  which represented of pre tax profits 
the monetary increase in income tax has been primarily due to the increase in pre tax profits from million to million 
during the company has undergone an analysis of its bad debt provisions following a change in polish tax law which became effective in  allowing for the accelerated tax deductability on unpaid debts 
following this analysis the company was able to process more of its provisions through its statutory tax books and form a more definitive opinion on the recoverability of the amounts included within the deferred tax asset 
as a result of this review the company has concluded that a valuation allowance is no longer appropriate which reduced current year income tax charge by  and the effective tax rate by

table of contents cash earnings defined as net earnings as adjusted for non cash expense income items such as depreciation movements in working capital  primarily the movements of trade receivables and payables as well as inventory movements in other current assets and liabilities 
the sources and uses of operating cash flows can be summarized as twelve months ended december  cash earnings movements in working capital movements in other current assets liabilities net cash used in generated by operating activities the use is primarily attributable to increased working capital requirements associated with the growth of the business  primarily in the increase in accounts receivable and inventory 
in our quarterly report for the nine months ended september   we discussed the impact of the change in the excise tax on domestic vodka which took place on october  the change in excise tax had the effect of reducing the value of vodka inventory at retail prices overnight 
because of this  wholesalers and retailers did not want any vodka inventory on september  the effect as at september  was to reduce working capital as the supply chain de stocked in anticipation of the change of excise tax 
in the three months ended december   we saw the reversal of that effect 
as a result  the fourth quarter represented of our annual sales 
this has had the effect of distorting trade receivables on a like for like basis 
in addition  the company purchased additional inventory to take advantage of certain incentives from one of its main suppliers  and these incentives have been included in the inventory valuation 
because of the strong seasonality of sales in the fourth quarter of where net sales equaled of annual net sales  compared to of annual net sales for  debtor days are best expressed based on the average sales for the quarter 
from this basis  the company was able to reduce debtor days from days in to days in using the same quarterly basis  the company also reduced creditor days from days in to days in the decrease in creditor days is mainly due to the use of cod terms for purchases of domestic vodka in the last weeks of for comparison purposes  readers should note that the trade receivables and payables include vat sales tax 
investing activities amounted to million in and are primarily related to the acquisitions of damianex  agis and onufry

with this in mind  the company arranged for various short term funds to be available to it which increased total debt by approximately million 
at december   the company had million of unused credit facilities available to it under these short term agreements 
the company believes that its operating cash flow  together with borrowings under available financing will be sufficient for its operating needs  other than future acquisitions  and debt servicing requirements as they become due

the company is exposed to translation risk arising from the restatement of it financial statements from polish zloty to us dollars a more detailed note on this risk is given in item a 
seasonality the company s net sales have been historically seasonable with on average of the net sales occurring in the fourth quarter 
during  net sales in the fourth quarter represented of annual sales compared to for the fourth quarter of this increase is mainly due to the recovery of lost sales from september where demand was deflated due to the reduction in excise tax which occurred on october  the table below demonstrates the movement and significance of seasonality on the income statement

table of contents the company continues to execute its business plan to develop a nationwide beverage distribution system throughout poland 
the company has begun to leverage its distribution infrastructure by adding non alcoholic beverages and cigars to the products it distributes 
from time to time  the company has considered and may in the future consider other potential means of leveraging the company s distribution expertise  which may include distributing additional products or further expanding its geographic coverage by means of acquisitions 
critical accounting policies and estimates general the foregoing discussion and analysis of the company s financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires the company to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of net sales  expenses  assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
revenue recognition revenue derived from beverage distribution is recognized when goods are shipped to customers and where a delivery acceptance note signed by the customer has been returned to the company 
sales are stated net turnover related customer discounts  an estimate of customer returns and sales tax vat 
revenue derived from retail operations less than of the total revenue is recognized at the point of sale 
expenses the company recognizes expenses in the period in which either the cost is incurred or in the period in which the associated revenue has been recognized 
allowance for doubtful accounts the allowances for doubtful accounts are based upon the aging of the accounts receivable 
the company makes an allowance based on a sliding scale which culminates in a provision should the receivable be over one year old 
where circumstances require  the company will make specific provisions for any excess not provided for under the general provision 
when a final determination is delivered to the company regarding the non recovery of a receivable  the company then charges the unrecoverable amount to the accumulated allowance 
inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
cost includes customs duty where applicable  and all costs associated with bringing the inventory for sale 
these costs include importation  handling  storage and transportation costs  and exclude rebates received from suppliers  which are reflected as reductions to closing inventory 
inventories are comprised primarily of beer  wine  spirits and non alcoholic beverages 
during the fourth quarter of  the company refined its inventory valuation methodology to better estimate direct costs incurred in bringing the inventory to its existing condition and location 
this change in estimate resulted in increased carrying value of inventory and an increase in operating income of  for the year ended december  
table of contents goodwill as required by fasb  acquired goodwill is no longer amortized 
instead the company assesses the recoverability of its goodwill at least once a year or whenever adverse events or as changes in circumstances or business climate for individual business units may not be sufficient to support the recorded goodwill 
if undiscounted cash flows are not sufficient to support the goodwill  an impairment charge would be recognized to reduce the carrying value of the goodwill based on the expected discounted cash flows of the business unit 
no such charge has been considered necessary through the date of the accompanying financial statements 
intangible assets intangibles consist primarily of acquired trademarks 
the trademarks are amortized on a straight line basis over the period of the expected economic benefits which is years 
the company assesses the recoverability of its trademarks at least once a year or whenever adverse events or changes in circumstances or business climate indicate that expected future cash flows undiscounted and without interest charges for individual business units may not be sufficient to support the recorded trademarks 
if the undiscounted cash flows were to be insufficient to support the recorded assets  an impairment charge would be recognized to reduce the carrying value of the trademarks 
no such charge has been considered necessary through the date of the accompanying financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk exchange rate fluctuations translation risks the company s operations are conducted primarily in poland and its functional currency is the polish zloty and the reporting currency is the us dollar 
the company s financial instruments consist mainly of cash and cash equivalents  accounts receivable  accounts payable and receivable  inventories  bank loans  overdraft facilities and long term debt 
all of the monetary assets represented by these financial instruments are located in poland  consequently  they are subject to currency translation risk when reporting in us dollars 
if the us dollar increases in value against the polish zloty  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses originally recorded in the polish zloty will decrease 
conversely  if the us dollar decreases in value against the polish zloty  the value in us dollars of assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses originally recorded in polish zloty will increase 
thus  increases and decreases in the value of the us dollar can have an impact on the value in us dollar of our non us dollar assets  liabilities  net sales and expenses  even if the value of these items has not changed in their original currency 
transaction risk commercial exposure 
our commercial foreign exchange exposure mainly arises from the purchase of imported alcoholic beverages in currencies other than our functional currency of the polish zloty 
thus  accounts payable for imported beverages are billed in various currencies and the company is subject to short term changes in the currency markets for product purchases 
the company also operates a bonded warehouse where the inventory acquired from foreign suppliers is recorded in its source currency 
thus  any currency movement in trade payables resulting from either a strengthening or weakening of the polish zloty against a foreign suppliers currency is often compensated for by an opposite movement relating to inventories recorded in the imported currency 
below is a table indicating the respective trade payable and imported inventory in us dollars usd  british pounds sterling gbp and euro eur 
please note that on january   the euro became the functional currency across the euro zone  and therefore items disclosed as eur may actually have been 
table of contents initially recorded in the base currency as of december  these have been restated to euro to reflect the corresponding settlement risk 
trade payables local currency usd equivalent local currency usd equivalent usd gbp eur total inventories local currency usd equivalent local currency usd equivalent usd gbp eur total financial exposure 
our general policy requires our subsidiaries to borrow funds and invest excess cash in the same currency as their functional currency  the polish zloty  where these funds are needed for and generated by operations 
where funds are needed for investment and acquisition purposes in previous years they have been taken in us dollar and euro 
in november  the company decided that the reducing interest rate differential between polish and us base rates no longer justified the exposure to foreign exchange risks on the non polish denominated debt 
therefore  the company decided to transfer the majority  approximately  of its acquisition debt to polish denominated debt 
total exposure to various currencies on its bank funding for and is given in the table below 
year of maturity thousands of usd bank loans payable in usd bank loans payable in euro bank loans payable in polish zloty bank overdrafts payable in polish zloty total bank funding loans with a contractual term of one year have been automatically renewed in the past and the company expects them to be renewed in the future 
bank loans and overdrafts denominated in polish zloty are also renewable after one year and have been presented according to their legal form 
more details of the repayments dates and conditions of both the short term and long term loans can be found in note of the financial statements 
bank borrowings are sensitive to interest and foreign currency market risks as they usually bear interest at variable rates and are denominated in various currencies 
the company increased management of its currency risk through the use of forward contracts for periods between three and six months 
however  in november  the company decided that the reduced interest rates in poland and the uncertainty of currency markets warranted the conversion of all debt into polish zloty 
this reconfiguration of the loan portfolio meant that the company no longer requires the use of forward exchange contracts 
for comparative purposes the amounts of open contracts at december for and were us dollar to polish zloty million euro to polish zloty million euro us dollar equivalent million 
table of contents exchange rates against us dollar at december  december  polish zloty euro interest rate fluctuations the company may have an exposure to interest rate movements through its bank deposits and indebtedness 
the company does not enter into any hedging arrangements in regards to its interest risk exposure ie  interest rate swaps or forward rate agreements 
because all of the company s debts are at floating rates  changes in interest rates may impact its net interest expense  positively by way of a reduction in base rates and adversely should base rates rise 
the company s sensitivity to interest rate movements is expressed in the table below
