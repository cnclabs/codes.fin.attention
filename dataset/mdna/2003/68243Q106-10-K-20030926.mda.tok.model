critical accounting policies and estimates the company s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the consolidated financial statements of flowers 
com  inc  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  management evaluates its estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventory and long lived assets  including goodwill and other intangible assets related to acquisitions 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies  among others  affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition net revenues are generated by online  telephonic and retail fulfillment operations and primarily consist of the selling price of merchandise  service or outbound shipping charges  less discounts  returns and credits 
net revenues are recognized upon product shipment 
accounts receivable the company maintains allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of its customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of the company s customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory the company states inventory at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the realization of inventories  we are required to make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with inventory levels 
it is possible that changes in consumer demand could cause a reduction in the net realizable value of inventory 
goodwill and other intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired and is evaluated annually for impairment 
the cost of intangible assets with determinable lives is amortized to reflect the pattern of economic benefits consumed  on a straight line basis  over the estimated periods benefited  ranging from to years 
the company periodically evaluates acquired businesses for potential impairment indicators 
judgment regarding the existence of impairment indicators is based on market conditions and operational performance of the company 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with our acquired businesses is impaired 
capitalized software the carrying value of capitalized software  both purchased and internally developed  is periodically reviewed for potential impairment indicators 
future events could cause the company to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that capitalized software is impaired 
income taxes the company has established deferred income tax assets and liabilities for temporary differences between the financial reporting bases and the income tax bases of its assets and liabilities at enacted tax rates expected to be in effect when such assets or liabilities are realized or settled 
the company records a valuation allowance on the deferred income tax assets to reduce the total to an amount management believes is more likely than not to be realized 
valuation allowances were principally to offset certain deferred income tax assets for operating loss carryforwards
