inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market with cost being determined on the first in  first out method 
management periodically reviews inventories for excess and obsolete goods based upon a combination of historical and forecasted usage 
additionally  discrete provisions are made when facts and circumstances indicate that particular inventories will not be utilized 
if future market conditions are different than those estimated  a change to the valuation of inventory may be required and would be reflected in the period the conditions change 
asset impairment the company periodically evaluates whether events and circumstances have occurred that indicate the remaining estimated useful life of any long lived or intangible asset may warrant revision or that the remaining balance of the asset may not be recoverable 
if factors indicate that the long lived assets should be evaluated for possible impairment  the company uses an estimate of the related asset s net undiscounted cash flows from operations over the remaining life to determine recoverability

until such time  except for foreign tax provisions  the company expects to have no reported tax provision  net of valuation allowance adjustments 
in the event the company was to determine  based on the existence of sufficient positive evidence  that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would increase income in the period such determination was made

in addition  the september amendment provides that any cash proceeds from the disposition of targeted company assets will be used to reduce the revolving credit facility and the senior notes in a ratio of and  respectively 
any net asset disposition payments to reduce the revolving credit facility will result in a proportionate reduction in the lender s commitments in the revolving credit facility

the company executed another amendment on november  the seventh amendment which contained additional provisions for the improvement period and also reset the net worth covenant

the company also has pledged slightly less than two thirds of the capital stock of two of its foreign subsidiaries

the company was not in compliance with its net worth covenant and its operating income before depreciation and amortization financial covenant of the revolving credit facility as of march  and there can be no assurance that the company will receive a waiver for these violations 
at march   the company had million outstanding under the revolving credit facility 
total availability under the revolving credit facility at march  was approximately million  after giving consideration to the borrowing base limitations under  the revolving credit facility but this availability can be revoked at any time due to the debt covenant violations 
due to the fact that the company s revolving credit facility expires on july   it will be necessary for the company to amend this revolving credit facility to extend the expiration date 
if the company is unable to negotiate an amendment to the revolving credit facility  it will be necessary for the company to refinance or repay this debt 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to accomplish such a transaction on terms acceptable to the company or at all 
failure to do so would have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition and could result in the company s inability to operate as a going concern

in addition  the senior notes provide that any cash proceeds from the disposition of targeted company assets will be used to reduce the revolving credit facility and the senior notes in a ratio of and  respectively 
any such additional payments used to reduce the senior notes will result in an equal reduction in the notes principal repayments 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to make notes principal repayments when due 
failure to do so would result in a default under the senior notes  in which case  the senior notes lender could pursue its remedies for default  including acceleration of principal  which would have a material adverse effect on the company s liquidity and financial condition and could result in the company s inability to operate as a going concern 
if the company is unable to operate as a going concern  it may file  or may have no alternative but to file  bankruptcy or insolvency proceedings or pursue a sale or sales of assets to satisfy creditors 
within the prudential senior notes agreement is a yield maintenance amount provision which ensures that the lender is paid the entire interest amount of the note 
the make whole provision states that the notes shall be subject to prepayment  in whole at any time or from time to time in part  at the option of the company  at of the principal amount so prepaid plus interest thereon to the prepayment date and the yield maintenance amount  if any  with respect to each note 
any partial prepayment of the notes which meets certain criteria shall be applied against the principal amount of the notes scheduled to become due in the inverse order of maturity thereof 
fiscal results include an interest charge of approximately million relating to the yield maintenance amount provisions of our senior notes agreement 
the yield maintenance amount provisions apply to certain optional prepayments of principle under the senior notes 
the company does not agree with and is disputing the note holder s interpretation that certain payments from the proceeds of sales of certain non core and international business assets made during and after fiscal are subject to the yield maintenance amount provisions 
further information about the yield maintenance amount provisions is included in note  long term debt  notes to consolidated financial statements included in item of this form k 
during fiscal  four non strategic business units were sold 
these dispositions included rohrback cosasco systems  bass trigon software and two smaller international offices

the company is required to maintain certain financial ratios under the senior notes 
the company was not in compliance with the financial covenants under the senior notes as of march  and there can be no assurance that the company will receive a waiver for these violations 
the company is negotiating agreements with its lenders to amend the current revolving credit facility and senior note agreements and to address existing violations 
in addition to other terms and conditions  we expect to incur interest rates on borrowings under the revolving credit facility at a higher applicable margin than under its existing provisions 
we also intend to seek during fiscal other financing to retire the senior notes and revolving credit facility 
there can be no assurance however that we will be able to amend the existing agreements or obtain other financing
