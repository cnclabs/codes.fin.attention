critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations is based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies and significant estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we generally recognize revenue upon shipment of our products and when title and risk of loss passes and when terms are fixed and collection is probable 
concurrent with the shipment of the product  we accrue estimated warranty expenses 
estimated warranty expenses are recorded on product revenues and adjusted periodically based on historical and anticipated experience 
we have undertaken projects  which include the development and construction of large complex cargo inspection systems requiring installation and customization at the customer s site 
sales under such long term contracts are recorded under the percentage of completion method 
costs and estimated revenues are recorded as work is performed based on the percentage that incurred costs bear to estimated total costs utilizing the most recent estimates of costs 
if the current contract estimate indicates a loss  provision is made for the total anticipated loss in the current period 
the percentage of completion method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revenues from separate service maintenance contracts are recognized ratably over the term of the agreements 
for other services  service revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
deferred revenue for services arises from advance payments received from customers for services not yet performed 

table of contents accounts receivable 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust credit limits based upon each customer s payment history and current credit worthiness  as determined by credit information available at that time 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  cost is determined on the first in  first out method 
we write down inventory for slow moving and obsolete inventory based on assessments of future demands for the next to months  market conditions and customers who may be experiencing financial difficulties 
if these factors are less favorable than those projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not  based upon currently available evidence and other factors  that we will not realize some portion or all of our deferred tax assets 
we base our determination of the need for a valuation allowance on an on going evaluation of past and current evidence including  among other things  historical earnings  estimates of future earnings  the backlog of customer orders and the expected timing of deferred tax asset reversals 
we charge or credit adjustments to the valuation allowance to income tax expense in the period in which these determinations are made 
if we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase net income in the period this determination was made 
likewise  if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would reduce net income and would establish a valuation allowance for the deferred tax asset in the period this determination was made

 accounting for asset retirement obligations  which addresses the obligations and asset retirement costs associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
it requires that the fair value of the liability for an asset retirement obligation be recorded when incurred instead of over the life of the asset 
the asset retirement costs must be capitalized as part of the carrying value of the long lived asset 
if the liability is settled for an amount other than the recorded balance  either a gain or loss will be recognized at settlement 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or result of operations 
on july   we adopted sfas no

table of contents long lived assets to be disposed of  and addresses the accounting for a component of an entity which has been disposed of and which has been classified as held for sale

 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
requires the recognition of costs associated with exit or disposal activities when incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
replaces previous accounting guidance provided by the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the emerging issues task force eitf reached a consensus on issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities and how arrangement considerations should be measured and allocated to the separate units of accounting in the arrangement 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we are currently assessing the effect of the adoption of eitf issue no 
on our financial position and results of operations 
in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation number  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it issues 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective bases to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ended after december  the adoption of fin did not have a material effect on our financial position or result of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas no 
amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
 amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the voluntary transition provisions of sfas no 
became effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
become effective for us for the year ended june  we are currently assessing the impact of the adoption of this statement on our financial position and results of operations 
in january the fasb issued interpretation number  consolidation of variable interest entities fin  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
fin requires that variable interest entities be consolidated by a company if that company absorbs a majority of the entity s expected losses  receives a majority of its expected residual returns  or both  as a result of holding variable interest  which are the ownership  contractual  or other pecuniary interest in the entity 
at the september  meeting of the fasb  the fasb considered a partial deferral and certain proposed modifications to fin  to address certain implementation issues 
the board reached a tentative conclusion that the effective date of fin would be the end of the first interim or annual period ending after december  when certain conditions are met by a variable interest entity 
the company believes that the variable interest entity in which it has invested has met these conditions 
upon the ultimate effective dates  the consolidation requirements of fin will apply to 
table of contents variable interest in a variable interest entity created after january  certain disclosure requirements of fin became effective for us as of year end 
we anticipate that our adoption of fin will require that we consolidate our investment in an overseas based research and development venture focused on security technologies see note which is currently accounted for under the equity method 
during march  the fasb s emerging issues task force eitf discussed proposed guidance under eitf issue the meaning of other than temporary impairment and its application to certain investments issue for assessing other than temporary impairment as applied to investments accounted for under the cost method or the equity method  including investments classified as either available for sale or held to maturity under sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the proposed guidance states that an impairment shall be deemed other than temporary unless positive evidence indicating that an investment s carrying amount is recoverable within a reasonable period of time outweighs negative evidence to the contrary 
under the proposed guidance  if an investment has been impaired for one year  it would be unlikely that sufficient objective and verifiable positive evidence would be available to support the recoverability of the investment s carrying value to overcome the extent of the negative evidence  except for certain investments with non contingent contractual future cash flows 
although issue is still under discussion by the eitf  the company believes that the proposed guidance will not have a significant affect on the company s results of operations or its financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk we are exposed to certain market risks  which are inherent in our financial instruments and arise from transactions entered into in the normal course of business 
we may enter into derivative financial instrument transactions in order to manage or reduce market risk in connection with specific foreign currency denominated transactions 
we do not enter into derivative financial instrument transactions for speculative purposes 
we are subject to interest rate risk on our short term borrowings under our bank lines of credit 
borrowings under these lines of credit do not give rise to significant interest rate risk because these borrowings have short maturities and are borrowed at variable interest rates 
historically  we have not experienced material gains or losses due to interest rate changes 
foreign currency the accounts of our operations in singapore  malaysia  england  finland  india  norway and canada are maintained in singapore dollars  malaysian ringgits  uk pounds sterling  euro  indian rupees  norwegian kroner and canadian dollars  respectively 
foreign currency financial statements are translated into us dollars at current rates  with the exception of revenues  costs and expenses  which are translated at average rates during the reporting period 
gains and losses resulting from foreign currency transactions are included in income  while those resulting from translation of financial statements are excluded from income and accumulated as a component of shareholder s equity 
transaction losses of approximately  and  were included in income for fiscal and  respectively 
a hypothetical change in the relevant currency rates at june   would not have a material impart on our financial position or results of operations 
our use of derivatives consists primarily of foreign exchange contracts and an interest rate swap 
we purchase forward contracts to hedge foreign exchange exposure related to commitments to acquire inventory for sale 
we do not use the contracts for trading purposes 
as of june   we had one foreign exchange contract with a notional amount of million to hedge foreign exchange exposure on accounts receivables and accounts payable in malaysia in the event of possible change in monetary policy in malaysia relating to the pegging of malaysian ringgit to the us dollar 
since the monetary policy remained unchanged and the 
table of contents malaysian ringgit is still pegged to the us dollar  the forward exchange contract has no fair value as of june  this contract expires in september importance of international markets international markets provide us with significant growth opportunities 
however  the following events  among others  could adversely affect our financial results in subsequent periods periodic economic downturns in different regions of the world  changes in trade policies or tariffs  and political instability 
for the year ended june   overall foreign currency fluctuations relative to the us dollar had an immaterial effect on our consolidated revenues and results of operations 
as a result of monetary policy in malaysia  including the pegging of the malaysian ringgit to the us dollar  we believe that our foreign currency exposure in malaysia will not be significant in the foreseeable future 
we continue to perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers financial condition and  if deemed necessary  we require advance payments for sales 
we monitor economic and currency conditions around the world to evaluate whether there may be any significant effect on our international sales in the future 
due to our overseas investments and the necessity of dealing with local currencies in our foreign business transactions  we are at risk with respect to foreign currency fluctuations 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material impact on our results of operations 
interest rate risk all highly liquid investments with a maturity of three months or less are classified as cash equivalent and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value 
short term investments are comprised of high quality marketable securities 
we have not historically used derivatives to hedge our interest rate risk 
however  during the fiscal year we entered into an interest rate swap to convert a portion of our variable interest rate debt to a fixed rate liability 
the swap expires in june the fair value of the swap was  as of june   compared to  as of june  the decrease in the fair value of the swap is recorded in other comprehensive income  due to the swap meeting the criteria of an effective cash flow hedge 
the amount to be reclassified from other comprehensive income in the next twelve months is not expected to be material 
a hypothetical change in the interest rates at june   related to our debt would not have a material impart on our position or results of operations 
the carrying amount  principal maturity and estimated value of our investment portfolio and long term debt exposure as of june  are as follows in thousands carrying amount maturity fair value investments cash and cash equivalents average interest rate long term debt secured long term loan average interest rate

table of contents risk factors investing in our common stock involves a significant degree of risk 
investors should carefully consider the following risk factors and all the other information contained in this report or incorporated by reference 
if any of the following risks actually occurs  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer  in which case the trading price of our common stock may decline 
risks related to our business fluctuations in our operating results may cause our stock price to decline 
given the nature of the markets in which we participate  we cannot reliably predict future revenues and profitability 
changes in competitive  market and economic conditions may cause us to adjust our operations 
a high proportion of our costs are fixed  due in part to our significant sales  research and development  and manufacturing costs 
thus  small declines in revenue could disproportionately affect our operating results 
factors that may affect our operating results and the market price of our common stock include demand for and market acceptance of our products  competitive pressures resulting in lower selling prices  adverse changes in the level of economic activity in regions in which we do business  adverse changes in industries  such as semiconductors and electronics  on which we are particularly dependent  changes in the portions of our revenue represented by various products and customers  delays or problems in the introduction of new products  the announcement or introduction of new products  services or technological innovations by our competitors  variations in our product mix  the timing and amount of our expenditures in anticipation of future sales  increased costs of raw materials or supplies  and changes in the volume or timing of product orders 
we face aggressive competition in many areas of business 
if we do not compete effectively  our business will be harmed 
we encounter aggressive competition from numerous competitors in many areas of our business 
in the security and inspection market  competition is based primarily on such factors as product performance  functionality and quality  cost  prior customer relationships  technological capabilities of the product  price  certification by government authorities  local market presence  and breadth of sales and service organization 
in the optoelectronic devices and subsystem market and in the medical monitoring and imaging systems market  competition is based primarily on factors such as expertise in the design and development of optoelectronic devices  product quality  timeliness of delivery  price  customer technical support  and on the ability to provide fully integrated services from application development and design through volume subsystem production 
we may not be able to compete effectively with all of our competitors 
to remain competitive  we must develop new products and enhance our existing products in a timely manner 
we anticipate that we may have to adjust prices 
table of contents of many of our products to stay competitive 
in addition  new competitors may emerge  and entire product lines may be threatened by new technologies or market trends that reduce the value of these product lines 
the september terrorist attacks and the creation of the us department of homeland security have increased financial expectations that may not materialize 
the september terrorist attacks and the subsequent creation of the us department of homeland security have created increased interest in our security and detection products  however  we are not certain whether the level of demand will continue to be as high as anticipated 
we do not know what solutions will continue to be adopted by the us department of homeland security as a result of the terrorism and whether our products will be a part of the solution 
additionally  should our products be considered as a part of the future security solution  it is unclear what the level may be and how quickly funding to purchase our products may be made available 
these factors may adversely impact us and create unpredictability in revenues and operating results 
our revenues are dependent on orders in the security and inspection products category  which has lengthy and unpredictable sales cycles 
sales of security and inspection products depend in significant part upon the decision of governmental agencies to upgrade or expand existing airports  border crossing inspection sites and other security installations 
accordingly  a portion of our sales of security inspection and detection products is often subject to delays associated with the lengthy approval processes that typically accompany such capital expenditures 
during these approval periods  we expend significant financial and management resources in anticipation of future orders that may not occur 
if we fail to receive an order after expending such resources  such failure could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if we do not introduce new products in a timely manner  our products could become obsolete and our operating results would suffer 
we sell many of our products in industries characterized by rapid technological changes  frequent new product and service introductions and evolving industry standards 
without the timely introduction of new products and enhancements  our products could become technologically obsolete over time  in which case our revenue and operating results would suffer 
the success of our new product offerings will depend upon several factors  including our ability to accurately anticipate customer needs  innovate and develop new technologies and applications  successfully commercialize new technologies in a timely manner  price our products competitively and manufacture and deliver our products in sufficient volumes and on time  and differentiate our offerings from our competitors offerings 
some of our products are used by our customers to develop  test and manufacture their products 
we therefore must anticipate industry trends and develop products in advance of the commercialization of our customers products 
in developing any new product  we may be required to make a substantial investment before we can determine the commercial viability of the new product 
if we fail to accurately foresee our customers needs and future activities  we may invest heavily in research and development of products that do not lead to significant revenue 

table of contents interruptions in our ability to purchase raw materials and components may adversely affect our profitability 
we purchase certain raw materials and subcomponents from third parties pursuant to purchase orders placed from time to time 
purchase order terms range from three months to one year at fixed costs  but we do not have guaranteed long term supply arrangements with our suppliers 
any material interruption in our ability to purchase necessary raw materials or subcomponents could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully implement our acquisitions strategy  integrate acquired businesses into our existing business or make acquired businesses profitable 
one of our strategies is to supplement our internal growth by acquiring businesses and technologies that complement or augment our existing product lines 
this growth has placed  and may continue to place  significant demands on our management  working capital and financial resources 
we may be unable to identify or complete promising acquisitions for many reasons  including competition among buyers  the need for regulatory approvals  including antitrust approvals  and the high valuations of businesses 
some of the businesses we may seek to acquire may be marginally profitable or unprofitable 
for these acquired businesses to achieve acceptable levels of profitability  we must improve their management  operations  products and market penetration 
we may not be successful in this regard and may encounter other difficulties in integrating acquired businesses into our existing operations 
to finance our acquisitions  we may have to raise additional funds  through either public or private financings 
we may be unable to obtain such funds or may be able to do so only on unfavorable terms 
economic  political and other risks associated with international sales and operations could adversely affect our sales 
in fiscal years   and revenues from shipments made outside of the united states accounted for approximately   and respectively  of our revenues 
of the revenues generated during fiscal from shipments made to customers outside of the united states  represented sales from the united states to foreign customers  and the balance represented sales generated by our foreign subsidiaries 
since we sell our products worldwide  our businesses are subject to risks associated with doing business internationally 
we anticipate that revenue from international operations will continue to represent a substantial portion of our total revenue 
in addition  many of our manufacturing facilities  employees and suppliers are located outside the united states 
accordingly  our future results could be harmed by a variety of factors  including changes in foreign currency exchange rates  changes in a country s or region s political or economic conditions  particularly in developing or emerging markets  longer payment cycles of foreign customers and difficulty of collecting receivables in foreign jurisdictions  trade protection measures and import or export licensing requirements  differing tax laws and changes in those laws  difficulty in staffing and managing widespread operations  differing labor laws and changes in those laws  
table of contents differing protection of intellectual property and changes in that protection  and differing regulatory requirements and changes in those requirements 
our failure to protect our intellectual property could impair our competitive position 
while we own certain patents and trademarks  some aspects of our business cannot be protected by patents or trademarks 
accordingly  in these areas there are few legal barriers that prevent potential competitors from copying certain of our products  processes and technologies or from otherwise entering into operations in direct competition with us 
our products may infringe on the intellectual property rights of others  and resulting claims against us could be costly and prevent us from making or selling certain products 
third parties may seek to claim that our products and operations infringe their patent or other intellectual property rights 
we may incur significant expense in any legal proceedings to protect our proprietary rights or to defend infringement claims by third parties 
in addition  claims of third parties against us could result in awards of substantial damages or court orders that could effectively prevent us from making  using or selling our products in the us or abroad 
a claim for damages could materially and adversely affect our financial condition and results of operations 
our business exposes us to potential product liability risks  particularly with respect to our security and inspection products 
there are many factors beyond our control that could lead to liability claims  including the failure of the products in which our subsystems are installed  the reliability of the customers operators of the inspection equipment  and the maintenance of the inspection units by the customers 
there can be no assurance that the amount of product liability insurance that we carry will be sufficient to protect us from product liability claims 
a product liability claim in excess of the amount of insurance we carry could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our ongoing success is dependent upon the continued availability of certain key employees 
we are dependent in our operations on the continued availability of the services of our employees  many of whom are individually key to our current and future success  and the availability of new employees to implement our growth plans 
in particular  we are dependent upon the services of deepak chopra  our chairman of the board of directors  president and chief executive officer 
we have entered into a year employment agreement with mr 
chopra  which expires april  and we maintain a million policy of key man life insurance on the life of mr 
chopra 
the market for skilled employees is highly competitive  especially for employees in technical fields 
while our compensation programs are intended to attract and retain the employees required for it to be successful  there can be no assurance that we will be able to retain the services of all of our key employees or a sufficient number to execute on our plans  nor can there be any assurances that we will be able to continue to attract new employees as required 
our failure to comply with environmental regulations may create significant environmental liabilities and force us to modify our manufacturing processes 
we are subject to various federal  state and local environmental laws  ordinances and regulations relating to the use  storage  handling and disposal of certain hazardous substances and wastes used or generated in the manufacturing and assembly of our products 
under such laws  we may become liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous substances or wastes that have been or are being disposed of offsite as wastes or that have been or are being released on or in our facilities 
such laws may impose liability without regard to whether we knew of  or caused  the release of such hazardous substances or wastes 
any failure by us to comply with present or future regulations could subject us to the imposition of substantial fines  suspension of 
table of contents production  alteration of manufacturing processes or cessation of operations  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
changes in governmental regulations may reduce demand for our products or increase our expenses 
we compete in markets in which we or our customers must comply with federal  state  local and foreign regulations  such as environmental  health and safety and food and drug regulations 
we develop  configure and market our products to meet customer needs created by these regulations 
any significant change in these regulations could reduce demand for our products 
risks related to our capital structure and common stock our articles of incorporation and other agreements contain provisions that could discourage a takeover 
our articles of incorporation authorize our board of directors to issue up to  shares of preferred stock in one or more series  to fix the rights  preferences  privileges and restrictions granted to or imposed upon any wholly unissued shares of preferred stock  to fix the number of shares constituting any such series  and to fix the designation of any such series  without further vote or action by shareholders 
the terms of any series of preferred stock  which may include priority claims to assets and dividends and special voting rights  could adversely affect the rights of the holders of common stock and thereby reduce the value of our common stock 
we have no present plans to issue shares of preferred stock 
the issuance of preferred stock  coupled with the concentration of ownership in the directors and executive officers  could discourage certain types of transactions involving an actual or potential change in control of the company  including transactions in which the holders of common stock might otherwise receive a premium for their shares over then current prices  otherwise dilute the rights of holders of common stock  and may limit the ability of such shareholders to cause or approve transactions which they may deem to be in their best interests  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the market price of our common stock 
we have in place a stockholder rights plan  adopted in  under which our stockholders are entitled to purchase shares of preferred stock under certain circumstances 
these circumstances include the purchase of or more of the outstanding shares of common stock by a person or group  or the announcement of a tender or exchange offer to acquire or more of the outstanding common stock 
the stockholder rights plan may have the effect of impeding or preventing certain types of transactions involving a change in control of the company that could be beneficial to the stockholders 
the company s articles of incorporation limit the liability of its directors  which may limit the remedies that the company or its shareholders have available 
the company s articles of incorporation provide that  pursuant to the california corporations code  the liability of its directors for monetary damages shall be eliminated to the fullest extent permissible under california law 
this is intended to eliminate the personal liability of a director for monetary damages in an action brought by the company  or in its right  for breach of a director s duties to the company or its shareholders and may limit the remedies available to the company or its shareholders 
this provision does not eliminate the directors fiduciary duty and does not apply to liabilities for i acts or omissions that involve intentional misconduct or a knowing and culpable violation of law  ii acts or omissions that a director believes to be contrary to the best interests of the company or its shareholders or that involve the absence of good faith on the part of the director  iii any transaction from which a director derived an improper personal benefit  iv acts or omissions that show a reckless disregard for the director s duty to the company or its shareholders in circumstances in which the director was aware  or should have been aware  in the ordinary course of performing a director s duties  of a risk of serious injury to the company or its shareholders  v acts or omissions that constitute an unexcused pattern of inattention that amounts to an abdication of the director s duty to the company or its shareholders  vi certain transactions or the approval of transactions in which a director has a material financial interest  and vii expressly imposed by statute for approval of certain improper distributions to shareholders or certain loans or guarantees
