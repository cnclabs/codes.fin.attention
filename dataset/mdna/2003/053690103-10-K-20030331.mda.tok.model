item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties 
avigen s actual results may differ significantly from the results discussed in the forward looking statements 
factors that might cause or contribute to such a differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed herein and in risk factors under item overview since our inception  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to research and development activities 
we are a development stage company and have not received any revenue from the sale of products  and we do not anticipate generating revenue from the sale of products in the foreseeable future 
we expect our source of revenue  if any  for the next several years to consist of government grants and payments under collaborative arrangements 
we have incurred losses since our inception and expect to incur substantial losses over the next several years due to ongoing and planned research and development efforts  including preclinical studies and clinical trials 
there can be no assurance that we will successfully develop  commercialize  manufacture or market our products or ever achieve or sustain product revenues for profitability 
at december  we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in august  we changed our fiscal year end from june to december  beginning with the six months ended december  critical accounting policies the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
we consider the following to be critical accounting policies important to our financial condition and results of operations that require management to make judgments  assumptions and estimates that are inherently uncertain 
valuation of investments in financial instruments investments in financial instruments are carried at fair value with unrealized gains and losses included in accumulated other comprehensive income or loss in stockholders equity 
our investment portfolio does not include equity securities or derivative financial instruments that could subject us to material market risk  however  we do invest in corporate obligations that subject us to varying levels of credit risk 
if the fair value of a financial instrument has declined below its carrying value for a period in excess of six consecutive months or if the decline is due to a significant adverse event  such that the carrying amount of these investments may not be fully recoverable  the impairment is considered other than temporary 
an other than temporary decline in fair value of a financial instrument would be subject to write down with a charge included in net loss 
the determination of whether a decline in fair value is other than temporary requires significant judgment  and could have a material impact on our balance sheet and results of operations 
our management reviews the securities within our portfolio for other than temporary declines in value with our investment advisor on a regular basis 
in  we did not write down the value of any of our financial instruments because we did not determine that any of the declines in fair value of our financial instruments were other than temporary 
impairment of property and equipment we have invested significant amounts on construction for improvements to our research and development facilities  with the largest portion of our spending made to modify manufacturing facilities that are intended to comply with requirements of government mandated manufacturing rules for pharmaceutical production 
these assets could be subject to write down for impairment in the event that our facilities are deemed to fail to comply with these government mandated policies and procedures 
these assets could also be subject to write down to the extent that facilities could be idled due to the adoption of operating efficiencies for an other than temporary period  resulting in excess capacity 
the determination of whether an impairment in use is other than temporary requires significant judgment  and could have a material effect on our balance sheet and our results of operations 
in  we did not write down the value of any of our property and equipment for impairments in fair value 
valuation allowance for net deferred tax assets to date we have incurred significant tax losses that have resulted in deferred tax assets 
due to our history of losses and the uncertainty of generating taxable profits in the future  management has determined that a valuation allowance should be provided against the full amount of the net deferred tax assets 
if the uncertainty regarding our ability to generate taxable income in the future changes  a reduction in the level of the valuation allowance may be required 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses include salaries and benefits costs  fees for contractors and consultants  fees to collaborators for preclinical research studies  patient treatment costs related to clinical trials and related clinical manufacturing costs  license fees for use of third party intellectual property rights  and an allocation of facilities and overhead costs 
research and development expenses consist of costs incurred for drug and product development  manufacturing  clinical activities  discovery research  screening and identification of drug candidates  and preclinical studies 
all such costs are charged to research and development expenses as incurred  with the costs of materials and other supplies charged to research and development expense upon receipt 
the progress and timing of activities associated with our research and development efforts in the future may cause variability in the future level of our research and development spending 
results of operations as a result of the change from a june fiscal year to a calendar year effective december   which resulted in a six month transition period  it is difficult to compare our results of operations  or any of the components of our results of operations  between the full years ended december  and june  to the six month transition period ended december  in order to best understand the trends in our results of operations  primarily expenses  over the most recent reporting periods  we have included analyses of variances between the fiscal year ended december  and the unaudited twelve month period ended december   the fiscal year ended december  and the fiscal year ended june   and the fiscal year ended june  and the fiscal year ended june  comparison of the fiscal year ended december  and the unaudited twelve month period ended december  revenue total revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  consisting of  in royalties and  in new research license agreement fees 
total revenue for the twelve month period ended december  was  consisting of  of grant revenue and  in new research license agreement fees 
research license agreements allow the licensee to make or use products using our patented aav technologies for research purposes only  and do not allow for the use of our technologies in products for commercial sale 
these licenses usually include initiation fees and annual maintenance fees 
royalty revenue is from a single royalty license  which allows for the development  manufacture  use and sale of products using our patented aav technologies 
we entered into this license agreement in july we did not receive any grant revenue during grant revenue consists of reimbursements under a grant from the national institutes of health nih  which expired on march  we do not expect to earn significant revenues from either new or existing research license agreements or royalty licenses  or to be party to any new nih grants  for the foreseeable future 
operating expenses our research and development expenses totaled million for the fiscal year ended december  and million for the twelve month period ended december  the increase of million was primarily due to the rising costs associated with the growth in staff and research programs 
our research and development staff count grew from approximately at the beginning of to approximately at december   and continued to rise to a peak of approximately in september before the impact of a workforce reduction in the fourth quarter of that year 
at december   we had reduced our research and development staff level to approximately rising personnel costs account for approximately million of the total increase in research and development expenses  while expanded preclinical activities with third party collaborators in added approximately  and an increase in the number of patients treated in our coagulin b clinical trial in added approximately  to the total increase 
depreciation expense in was approximately  higher for assets associated with research and development activities  primarily due to the impact of newly constructed facilities that were placed in service during the year for general and animal research  and validation services related to our pilot plant were  higher 
offsetting the impact of these rising costs between the two periods was a reduction in recruiting expenses of approximately  and a reduction in license fees paid of approximately  as well as broad based reduction in costs of approximately  associated with the use of materials to produce our aav vector as we began to benefit from recent advances in our facilities and processes that achieved significant operating efficiencies 
as a result of the strategic steps we took over the last six months to focus the work of our research and development organizations on our lead product development programs  and our expectations for further efficiencies in our vector production processes  we expect total research and development spending to decline as much as million in from the level without adversely affecting the progress of those product development programs 
we also expect that total research and development spending in subsequent years will resume an increasing trend from this lower baseline as we continue to conduct our clinical trials  enhance our manufacturing capabilities  and expand our research programs for additional gene therapy applications 
our general and administrative expenses totaled million for the fiscal year ended december  and million for the twelve month period ended december   resulting in an increase of approximately  the increase between the two periods is primarily due to approximately  in higher personnel related costs   in higher legal fees related to litigation   in higher corporate expenses  including insurance and information services  and  in higher depreciation and facilities related expenses 
these higher costs were partially offset by a  decline in other expenses  primarily for professional services  due to the fact that in the twelve month period ended december  we had two audits and prepared and filed two annual reports as a result of the change of our fiscal year end from june to december in that year 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will decline slightly in as a result of the reduction or our workforce in october and to remain steady or return to an increasing trend over subsequent years 
interest income interest income totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the twelve month period ended december  since almost all of our interest income comes from our investments in high grade marketable securities of government and corporate debt with an average maturity of approximately one year  the fluctuations in our interest income between periods is influenced to a large extent by the average size of our portfolio of interest earning cash and investments outstanding during those periods and changes in the short term interest rate environment 
the million decrease in interest income for the year ended december  versus the twelve month period ended december  was primarily due to the decline in market interest rates between the two periods  as well as the decrease in outstanding cash and securities balances since resources have been used to fund our on going operations and finance construction for additional research and development facilities 
comparison of the fiscal years ended december  and june  revenue total revenue for the fiscal year ended december  was  consisting of  in royalties and  in new research license agreement fees 
total revenue for the fiscal year ended june  was  which consisted of  in grant revenue and  in connection with the royalty license agreement entered into in july revenue decreased by  primarily due to the lack of grant revenue related to an nih grant that expired on march  this reduction was partially offset by the increase in royalty and new research agreement fee revenue earned in operating expenses our research and development expenses totaled million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the increase of million reflects the expansion of our research and development activities  including increased staff  additional facilities  and expanded activities with third party collaborators in preclinical studies and clinical trials 
personnel costs rose million between the two periods as our staff count attributable to research and development activities rose from at the beginning of the june  fiscal year to at the end of that period  and continued to rise to a peak of approximately in september before the impact of a workforce reduction in the fourth quarter of that year 
also contributing to the rise in total research and development expenses between these periods were  in higher costs associated with the increased facilities related costs and validation services associated with the expansion of our research and pilot plant manufacturing facilities  million in additional depreciation and amortization of the same facilities  million in higher costs for materials consumed to meet the rising demand for production of research and clinical grade quantities of our aav vectors  and million in higher payments to third parties for expansion of our collaborative preclinical studies  primarily with respect to parkinson s disease  and costs associated with the treatment of increased numbers of patients in our clinical trial for coagulin b 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in recruiting expenses  license fees paid  and other support costs of approximately  our general and administrative expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the million increase was due to  in higher personnel related costs   in higher legal fees related to litigation   in higher corporate expenses  including insurance and information services  and  in higher depreciation and facilities related expenses associated with our increased office space 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of approximately  in professional services 
interest income interest income totaled million for the fiscal year ended december  compared to million for the fiscal year ended june  the million decrease in interest income was primarily due to the decline in market interest rates between the two periods  as well as the decrease in outstanding cash and securities balances since resources have been used to fund our on going operations and finance construction for additional research and development facilities 
comparison of the fiscal years ended june  and revenue total revenue for the fiscal years ended june  and was  and  respectively 
all revenue for the fiscal year was grant revenue 
the increase in total revenue between the two fiscal years was due to the  increase in grant revenue received  caused by the irregular timing of milestones in connection with the grant  and the receipt of  in connection with the royalty license agreement entered into during the fiscal year ended june  operating expenses our research and development expenses for the fiscal years ended june  and were million and million  respectively 
the increase of million in total research and development expenses was primarily related to a significant increase in personnel and new research and production facilities placed in operation  as well as higher consumption of materials used to support the progress of our initial clinical trail for coagulin b and develop scalable manufacturing processes to meet the capacity of our pilot plant 
our staff almost doubled between june and june and we significantly increased our premises under lease 
we entered into a sublease for approximately  additional square feet in march  when we began construction of our pilot plant and other research facilities  and added additional space to support our research and development activities when we entered into a lease of a second building adjacent to our original facility in december our general and administrative expenses were million and million  respectively  for the fiscal years ended june  and  an increase of million 
this increase was primarily due to the impact of higher personnel and recruitment costs  higher legal costs associated with intellectual property activities  and increases in other corporate expenses such as insurances and property taxes 
in the fiscal year ended june   we incurred in license fees of million in connection with new agreements to in license certain patents that we use in our research and development efforts 
the expense included cash payments to licensors of approximately million and a non cash charge for a warrant issued to a licensor that was valued at approximately million 
these expenses were primarily initiation fees  and are not predictive of initial in license fees to be incurred in future periods 
no such in license fees have been incurred since 
interest income interest income totaled million and million for the fiscal years ended june  and  respectively 
between november and june  we raised approximately million through equity transactions  which included sales of stock pursuant to a public offering in november and a collaborative agreement with bayer corporation in february  and on going exercises of previously issued warrants and options 
these funds were included in our investment portfolio and were the dominant reason for the million in higher interest income 
research and development expenses our research and development expenses can be divided into two primary functions  representing costs to support research and preclinical development and costs to support clinical development for human clinical trials 
research and preclinical development costs include activities associated with general research and exploration  animal studies  production of vector for use by external collaborators in general research and exploration  and development of processes to translate research achievements into commercial scale capabilities 
during the years ended december  and  our programs in the research and preclinical phase were directed primarily at potential treatments of hemophilia  parkinson s disease and congestive heart failure 
clinical development costs include activities associates with maintaining regulated and controlled processes  manufacturing vector for use in human clinical trials  and supporting patient accrual and patient administration within clinical trials 
during the years ended december  and  our programs in the clinical development phase were directed at the potential treatment of hemophilia b and preparing for filing an ind for a potential treatment for parkinson s disease 
we estimate that the split in costs associated with these two categories approximate the following in thousands year ended december  unaudited twelve months ended december  six months ended december  fiscal year ended june  fiscal year ended june  research and preclinical development clinical development total research and development expenses because a significant percentage of our research and development resources are dedicated to activities that focus on fundamental aav vector characteristics and production and administration techniques  which are considered platform technologies that may be used in many different product applications  the majority of our costs are not directly attributed to individual projects 
decisions regarding our project management and resource allocation are primarily based on interpretations of scientific data  rather than cost allocations 
our estimates of costs between research and preclinical development and clinical development are primarily based on staffing roles within our research and development departments 
as such  costs allocated to specific projects may not necessarily reflect the actual costs of those efforts and  therefore  we do not generally evaluate actual costs incurred information on a project by project basis 
in addition  we are unable to estimate the future costs to completion for any specific projects 
the million increase in research and preclinical development expenses for the year ended december  over the unaudited twelve month period ended december  was due to increases in personnel costs of  depreciation and amortization for new facilities placed in service during the year of  and payments to third party collaborators of  primarily to support the progress in our preclinical animal studies for the treatment of parkinson s disease partially offset by a reduction of  in other costs 
the million increase in research and preclinical development expenses between the year ended december  and the fiscal year ended june  reflected the same progress and expansion of our programs that occurred in as compared to the earlier period 
this increase included million in higher personnel costs due to higher staff levels   in higher depreciation for new facilities placed in service in  million in higher payments to outside collaborators  primarily in connection with the expansion of our parkinson s disease program  and  for increased consumption of materials in the course of our work 
the million increase between the fiscal years ended june  and  primarily reflect the early stages of the diversification of our research programs and efforts to enhance our production techniques which led to the significant increase in staff levels  facilities used  and outside collaborations described previously 
clinical development expenses increased  for the year ended december  over the unaudited twelve month period ended december   and included approximately  in higher personnel costs   in higher clinical payments associated with treating a larger number of patients in   in higher depreciation for new facilities  and  in higher validation services related to our pilot plant 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease of  for materials used to make our aav vector due to the adoption of improvements that made our production processes more efficient   in lower license milestone payments  and  for recruiting and other costs 
because our clinical development programs expanded significantly during  the total expenses for the year ended december   which included a full twelve months of mature operations  were million higher than the total expenses for the fiscal year ended june   while much of the growth was still in progress 
the higher costs in include million in higher personnel expenses   in higher clinical payments   in higher validation services costs   in higher depreciation costs and  in higher materials costs 
in the same manner  the million increase in costs for the fiscal year ended june  over the fiscal year ended june  reflected the rise in costs during the very early stages of our first coagulin b clinical trial as we began to add staff and facilities to establish greater manufacturing capacity 
adoption of recently issued accounting standards in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  and interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin clarifies the requirements of fas  accounting for contingencies  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements of periods that end after december  however  the provision for the initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december  this interpretation does not currently have any impact on our financial position  results of operations or disclosure 
in december  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
fas amends fas accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  fas amends the disclosure requirements of fas to require more prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the additional disclosure requirements of fas are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method of accounting as prescribed by apb to account for employee and director stock options 
the impact of fas will be limited to the interim reporting of the effects on net income and net loss per share if we accounted for stock based compensation under fas in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin clarifies the application of accounting research bulletin no 
 consolidated financial statements  to certain entities in which equity investors do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january   and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
it applied in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june   to variable interest entities in which an enterprise holds a variable interest that it acquired before february  fin applies to public enterprises as of the beginning of the applicable interim or annual period 
we do not believe there will be a material effect upon our financial condition or results of operations from the adoption of fin deferred income tax assets in accordance with fas  accounting for income taxes  which is described in the notes to our financial statements  we have calculated a deferred tax asset based on the potential future tax benefit we may be able to realize in future periods as a result of the significant tax losses experienced since our inception 
however  the value of such deferred tax asset must be calculated using the tax rates expected to apply to the taxable income in the years in which such income occurs 
since we have no history of earnings  and cannot reliably predict when we might create taxable income  if at all  we have recorded a valuation allowance for the full amount of our calculated deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources since our inception in  cash expenditures have significantly exceeded our revenue 
we have funded our operations primarily through public offerings and private placements of our equity securities 
since our initial public offering in may  we have completed private placements of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock  raising net proceeds of approximately million  and two public offerings raising net proceeds of approximately million 
in addition  we also completed a sale of common stock to bayer ag in february pursuant to a collaboration agreement that raised net proceeds of million 
also  during the period since may  as a result of exercises of warrants and options to purchase our common stock  we raised an additional million 
the timing of and amounts realized from the exercise of these warrants and options are determined by the decisions of the respective warrant and option holders  and are not controlled by us 
therefore  funds raised from exercises of stock options and warrants in past periods should not be considered an indication of additional funds to be raised in the future periods 
in addition to funding our operations through sales of our common stock  we have attempted to contain costs and reduce cash flow requirements by renting scientific equipment and facilities  contracting with third parties to conduct research and development and using consultants  where appropriate 
we expect to incur additional future expenses  resulting in significant additional losses  as we continue to expand our research and development activities and undertake additional preclinical studies and clinical trials of our gene therapy product candidates 
we also expect to incur substantial additional expenses relating to the filing  prosecution  maintenance  defense and enforcement of patent and other intellectual property claims 
at december   we had cash  cash equivalents  available for sale securities  and restricted investments  including accrued interest  of approximately million  compared to million at december  of the amount at december   million was pledged to secure our line of credit and equipment operating leases 
in october  we announced the implementation of a revised strategic plan to reduce our projected cash burn rate and extend the anticipated life of our existing financial resources 
as a result  we reduced our workforce by approximately  or positions  primarily in operations and administration 
the total costs of implementing the staff reduction was approximately  in compensation  extended health benefits and outplacement training 
all of these costs were incurred prior to december   and will not impact future periods 
the following are contractual commitments at december  associated with debt obligations  lease obligations  and contractual commitments to fund third party research in thousands payments due by period contractual commitment total less than year years years after years revolving line of credit operating leases research funding for third parties total contractual commitments in june  we amended the terms of our million revolving line of credit which had been put in place with wells fargo bank in june to provide support for construction related activities 
under the terms of the amendment  the expiration date of the borrowing was extended from june  to june   thereby deferring the timetable to repay the principal borrowed for two years 
the debt instrument bears interest at a floating rate based on the london inter bank offered rate  which is reset in three month increments after the date of each drawdown  until such expiration 
as of december   the average annual rate of interest charged on the borrowing was approximately 
also under the terms of this agreement  we pledged a portion of our portfolio of available for sale securities as collateral and have identified the amount of the pledged securities as restricted investments on our balance sheets 
the amount of the pledged securities is equal to the amount of utilized borrowing capacity on the line of credit 
at december   we had borrowed million from the line of credit and had reserved the remaining million in borrowing capacity to secure a letter of credit in connection with the property lease entered into in november as a result  at december   we have no more borrowing capacity under this facility 
as collateral for the revolving line of credit  our restricted investments would not be considered a current source of additional liquidity 
the total amount of restricted investments at december   including the portion of our investment portfolio that is pledged as collateral for this line of credit and other securities that have been pledged to secure equipment operating leases  was million 
our current office and facility includes approximately  square feet of space 
of this  approximately  square feet of space is leased through may and approximately  square feet of space is leased through november payments scheduled under these lease commitments are included in the table above under operating leases 
we enter into commitments to fund collaborative research and clinical work performed by third parties 
while these contracts are cancelable  we expect the research studies and clinical work to be completed as defined in the terms of the agreements  and all amounts paid when due 
payments scheduled to be made under these contracts are included in the table above under research funding for third parties 
for the fiscal year ended december   net cash used in operating activities was million compared to million for the comparable twelve month period ended december  this change in cash used in operating activities between the two periods included approximately million in higher cash expenditures in the period  primarily due to increased staff costs and payments to third party collaborators to support preclinical and clinical activities as discussed above  and approximately million in lower interest income in the period to offset operating expenses 
during the six month transition period ended december   net cash of approximately million was used in operating activities versus million for the unaudited comparable six month period ended december  the increase of  reflected million in higher expenses related to higher staff levels  additional facilities under lease  and an increase in general consumption of materials for the production of greater quantities of our aav vectors to support our research and clinical activities 
this increase in expenses was partially offset by an increase of million in interest income in the period that reduced the net cash used by operating activities 
net cash used in operating activities during the fiscal year ended june  was million  approximately million less than the fiscal year ended december  this difference was primarily due to higher expenses in the period related to the growth in our staff and facilities  increased consumption of materials to meet the growing demand for production of our aav vectors  and higher payments to third party collaborators for preclinical research studies and clinical activities  as discussed above 
this difference also reflects approximately million in lower interest income in the period to offset operating expenses 
net cash used in operating activities was million for the year ended june   approximately million less than the fiscal year ended june  this difference included million in higher expenses related to growth in personnel  facilities and operating activities  partially offset by an increase of million in interest income in the fiscal year 
during the fiscal year ended december   approximately million and  respectively  were provided by investing and financing activities  primarily to fund ongoing operations 
the cash provided by investing activities consisted of maturities  net of purchases  of available for sale securities  offset in part by purchases of property  equipment and construction in progress of million and increases in restricted investments of million 
the cash provided by financing activities consisted of proceeds from the exercise of options and warrants during the year 
during the six month transition period ended december   approximately million and million  respectively  were provided by investing and financing activities  primarily to fund ongoing operations 
the cash provided by investing activities consisted of maturities  net of purchases  of available for sale securities  offset in part by purchases of property  equipment and construction in progress of million and increases in restricted investments of million 
the cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of additional borrowings from our revolving line of credit to provide funding for construction related activities 
during the fiscal year ended june   approximately million was used in investing activities and consisted mostly of purchases  net of maturities  of available for sale securities  as well as purchases of property  equipment and construction in progress of million and increases in restricted investments of million 
these investing activities were primarily funded by the approximately million that was provided by financing activities that were not immediately used to fund ongoing operations 
the cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of million of our common stock  net of issuance costs  in connection with a public offering in november and proceeds from the sale of million of our common stock to bayer ag under the terms of our collaboration agreement in february during the fiscal year ended june   approximately million was used in investing activities and consisted mostly of purchases  net of maturities  of available for sale securities  as well as purchases of property  equipment and construction in progress of million and increases in restricted investments of million 
these investing activities were primarily funded by the approximately million that was provided by financing activities that were not immediately used to fund ongoing operations 
the cash provided by financing activities primarily consisted of proceeds from the issuance of million of our common stock and warrants to purchase our common stock  net of issuance costs  in connection with a private placement in october and november and a public offering in april the remaining cash provided by financing activities consisted of million from the exercise of options and warrants during the year and million in additional borrowings from our revolving line of credit 
we believe we will continue to require substantial additional funding in order to complete the research and development activities currently contemplated and to commercialize our proposed products 
we believe that with the implementation of our revised strategic plan  our cash burn rate will be approximately million in  and we anticipate that our capital resources at december  will be adequate to fund our future needs over the next four to five years 
however  this forward looking statement is based upon our current plans and assumptions  which may change 
our future operating and capital requirements will depend on many factors  including continued scientific progress in research and development programs  the scope and results of preclinical studies and clinical trials  the time and costs involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the costs involved in filing  prosecuting and enforcing patents claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological developments  the cost of manufacturing scale up  the costs of commercialization activities  and other factors which may not be within our control 
we intend to continue to seek additional funding through public or private equity or debt financing  when market conditions allow  or through additional collaborative arrangements with corporate partners 
if we raise additional funds by issuing equity securities  there may be further dilution to existing stockholders 
we cannot assure our investors that we will be able to enter into such financing arrangements on acceptable terms or at all 
without such additional funding  we may be required to delay  reduce the scope of  or eliminate one or more of our research or development programs 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our investment portfolio and our long term debt 
we do not hold derivative financial investments  derivative commodity investments or other financial investments or engage in foreign currency hedging or other transactions that exposes us to other market risks 
our investment objectives are focused on preservation of principal and liquidity 
by policy  we manage our exposure to market risks by limiting investments to high quality issuers and highly liquid instruments with effective maturities of less than three years  and an average aggregate portfolio duration of approximately one year 
our entire portfolio is classified as available for sale and  as of december   consisted of approximately fixed rate securities and variable rate securities 
we have evaluated the risk associated with our portfolios of investments in marketable securities and have deemed this market risk to be immaterial 
if market interest rates were to increase by basis points  or  from their december  levels  we estimate that the fair value of our securities portfolio would decline by approximately million 
our estimated exposure at december  is lower than our estimated million exposure at december  due to the reduction in size of the overall portfolios and the reduction in average aggregate duration of the instruments 
the modeling technique used measures duration risk sensitivity to estimate the potential change in fair value arising from an immediate hypothetical shift in market rates and quantifies the ending fair market value including principal and accrued interest 
our long term debt includes a million revolving line of credit due june  interest charged on the borrowing is based on libor and is reset in three month increments based on the date of each original drawdown 
as of december   the average annual rate of interest charged on the borrowing was approximately
