item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview our businesses consist of aviall services  the largest independent global aftermarket provider of new aerospace parts and related supply chain services to the aviation industry  and ils  a leading independent information provider and operator of global electronic marketplaces for buying and selling parts  equipment and services for the aviation and marine industries and the us and international government procurement markets 
net sales 
aviall services net sales are generated primarily from the sale of new and oem remanufactured aerospace parts  components and supplies 
we sell these products at prices based upon either a discount from the manufacturers published list prices or with a margin above our cost to buy the product 
ils s net sales consist mainly of monthly or yearly subscription fees to access ils s online databases  fees charged to firms listing inventory in the databases  communications fees  income from the sale of custom reports and decision support products and fees for developing and hosting customers catalogs 
ils is an information service provider and does not own or sell the parts  equipment or services listed in its databases 
cost of sales and gross profit 
aviall services cost of sales consists primarily of costs incurred to purchase parts and supplies from oems  inventory carrying costs such as shrinkage and excess and obsolescence  and the amortization of the licensing fees for our significant long term agreements with honeywell and rolls royce 
we purchase parts  components and supplies based on discounts from the manufacturers published list prices as specified in agreements with our suppliers 
because the product sold by ils is information  we include the expenses required to maintain and operate the central ils computer system and communications network in our cost of sales 
these expenses include the salaries and benefits of the computer operations staff  depreciation and lease costs for computer and communications equipment  telecommunications expenses and software costs 
gross profit is the difference between the sales generated and the costs related to those sales 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses include all costs related to marketing  sales  planning and purchasing  accounting  finance  and other administrative departments of the two business units and the corporate staff 
in addition  aviall services selling and administrative expenses include costs related to operating its central warehouse and our worldwide customer service centers 
critical accounting policies the process of preparing financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the us requires us to use estimates and assumptions to determine certain of our assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
we base these estimates and assumptions upon the best information available to us at the time the estimates or assumptions are made 
our estimates and assumptions could change materially as conditions both within and beyond our control change 
accordingly  our actual results could differ materially from our estimates 
the most significant estimates made by our management include our allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  reserves for excess and obsolete inventories  deferred tax asset valuation allowances  environmental reserves  pension and postretirement benefit obligations and valuation of goodwill and distribution rights 
the following is a discussion of our critical accounting policies and the related management estimates and assumptions necessary in determining the value of related assets or liabilities 
a full description of all of our significant accounting policies is included in note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements included in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition 
revenue from the sale of parts  components and supplies and the repair of parts is recognized based on shipping terms with our customers 
revenue from information services and point of purchase subscription fees is recognized as services are rendered 
revenue from pay in advance subscription fees is deferred and recognized as services are rendered 
shipping and handling costs billed to customers are recognized as revenue 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable is established based on our estimates of the amount of uncollectible accounts receivable on a customer by customer basis 
we determine the required allowance using information such as customer credit history  industry and market segment information  economic trends and conditions  credit reports and customer financial condition 
the estimates can be affected by changes in the aviation industry  customer credit issues or customer bankruptcies 
inventories 
we value our inventory of aerospace parts at the lower of average cost or market 
we make provisions for excess and obsolete inventories based on our assessment of slow moving and obsolete inventories on a part number by part number basis within each product line 
historical parts sales and estimated future demand adjusted for known or expected aviation industry trends or conditions provide the basis for our estimates 
these estimates are subject to volatility and can be affected by reduced flight hours  the retirement of aircraft  changes in distribution agreements and other changes in the aviation industry 
we make provisions for inventory shrinkage based on periodic physical inventory counts 
during the second quarter of  we changed our classification of inventory obsolescence and inventory shrinkage from selling and administrative expenses to cost of sales 
prior periods have been reclassified to reflect this change 
distribution rights 
from time to time  we enter into long term supplier distribution agreements that implicitly include a payment for distribution rights 
when we enter into these agreements  we must value the distribution rights and amortize them over the life of the agreement 
we calculate the value of the distribution rights using a discounted cash flow model of the expected net contract cash flows related to the specific distribution agreement 
the most significant variables used in the model include expected sales  inventory value  incremental costs and working capital requirements 
we base our valuation of inventory acquired on the contractual purchase discount off of list price adjusted for historical and expected parts sales 
the determination of the amounts for the other factors used are based on information acquired during the agreement negotiation process 
we amortize the value of the distribution rights over the term of the agreement using the straight line method  which approximates the operating cash flows expected over the life of the agreement 
in the event one or more of our material suppliers discontinue the products we sell  terminate our contract or are unable to perform under our agreement  the value of the distribution rights could be impaired  and we might be required to write down or write off the unamortized value of the distribution rights 
deferred taxes 
we establish our deferred tax assets and liabilities based on our profits or losses in each jurisdiction in which we operate 
associated valuation allowances reflect the likelihood of the recoverability of these assets 
we base our judgement of the recoverability of these assets  which includes federal and  to a lesser degree  state net operating loss carryforwards  primarily on historical earnings  our estimate of current and expected future earnings  prudent and feasible tax planning strategies  and current and future ownership changes 
the likelihood of an annual limitation on our ability to utilize our us federal net operating loss carryforward to offset future us federal taxable income is increased by certain historical changes in our equity ownership when combined with potential future ownership changes occurring in the rolling three year testing period 
the amount of an annual limitation can vary significantly based on certain factors existing at the date of the ownership change 
if such limitations were imposed  they could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations and cash flows 
pension and postretirement benefits obligations 
the value of our pension and postretirement benefits assets and liabilities is determined on an actuarial basis 
these values are affected by the market value of plan assets  our estimates of the expected return on plan assets and the discount rates we use to value our projected benefit obligation 
we determine the discount rates using changes in the rates of return on high quality  fixed income investments 
actual changes in the fair market value of plan assets  differences between the actual return and the expected return on plan assets and changes in the discount rate we use affect the amount of pension expense we recognize 
valuation of long lived assets 
we periodically review the net realizable value of our long lived assets  including distribution rights  whenever events and circumstances indicate an impairment may have occurred 
in the event we determine that the carrying value of long lived assets is in excess of estimated gross future cash flows for those assets  we then will write down the value of the assets to a level commensurate with a discounted cash flow analysis of the estimated future cash flows 
goodwill 
goodwill represents the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired 
in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we ceased amortizing goodwill effective january  on an annual basis  we compare the fair value of our reporting units with their carrying values 
if the carrying value of a reporting unit exceeds its fair value  we would recognize an impairment equal to the excess of the fair value of the operating unit s goodwill over the carrying value of its goodwill 
the fair value of our reporting units is estimated using the discounted present value of estimated future cash flows 
environmental 
the costs relating to our environmental liabilities have been estimated  including exit costs related to our previously owned businesses  when it is probable that a loss has been incurred and such loss is estimable 
we base our probable environmental cost estimates on information obtained from independent environmental engineers and or from our experts regarding the nature and extent of environmental contamination  available remedial alternatives and the cleanup criteria required by relevant governmental agencies 
the estimated costs include anticipated site testing  consulting  remediation  disposal  postremediation monitoring and related legal fees 
they are based on available information and represent the undiscounted costs to resolve the environmental matters in accordance with prevailing federal  state  local or foreign requirements 
our estimates may vary in the future as more information becomes available to us with respect to the level of contamination  the effectiveness and approval of selected remediation methods  the stage of our investigation at the individual sites  the recoverability of such costs from third parties and changes in federal  state  local or foreign statutes and regulations or their interpretation 
due to the small quantities of chemicals used and the current programs in place  we do not anticipate any material environmental liabilities or significant capital expenditures will be incurred in the future related to ongoing operations to comply or remain in compliance with existing environmental regulations 
based on information presently available and our programs to detect and minimize contamination  we believe that the ultimate disposition of pending environmental matters related to our previously owned businesses will not have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  environmental matters related to our previously owned businesses could be material to our cash flows during any one year 
results of operations the following table sets forth our results of operations as a percentage of our net sales during the periods shown year ended december  statement of income data net sales cost of sales gross profit selling and administrative expenses unusual items operating income interest expense earnings from continuing operations before income taxes provision for income taxes earnings from continuing operations results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
net sales for aviall services were million  an increase of million or  from the million recorded in sales for aviall services were mixed by geographic region the americas region increased million or  europe fell million or  and the asia pacific region increased million or 
sales in the government military segment increased million related to the rr t program  while sales in the general aviation corporate segment improved by million  primarily as a result of what management believes to be increased market share 
sales in the weaker commercial airline segment declined million due to reduced demand for commercial airline travel 
sales of products under the rr t distribution agreement were million in the net sales amounts did not include million of rr t sales  valued at our contractual prices  made directly by rolls royce to the us military during the rr t transition period which ended in june but do include our full margin on these sales 
sales of products supplied by rolls royce and honeywell were million and million in and  respectively 
net sales for ils of million were up million year over year 
gross profit 
gross profit of million for was up million or from the level of million 
as expected  gross profit as a percentage of net sales fell to  reflecting the incorporation of lower margin rr t sales 
the gross profit was negatively affected by the million inventory and intangible write down resulting from the downturn in the aerospace industry 
this write down was reclassified to cost of sales from selling and administrative expenses to conform to our presentation 
selling and administrative expenses 
selling and administrative expenses increased million to million in from million in the increase in selling and administrative expenses is largely attributable to the rr t and honeywell product lines and higher depreciation costs associated with increased spending on technology infrastructure 
this increase in selling and administrative expenses was partially offset by the implementation of sfas  which reduced goodwill amortization by million in as compared to selling and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales fell percentage points to in from in unusual gain 
the unusual gain of million in resulted from the reversal of environmental reserves related to our previously owned businesses  which did not qualify as discontinued operations  due to changes in estimates for these liabilities 
interest expense 
interest expense increased million to million in from million in in  our interest expense included million of noncash expense 
the increase in our interest expense was primarily due to our new capital structure  which resulted in higher borrowings  higher amortization of debt issuance costs and debt discount and the issuance of the senior notes 
income tax expense 
income tax expense from continuing operations for was million  and our effective tax rate was 
our income tax expense from continuing operations was million  and our effective tax rate was 
the reduction in the effective tax rate year over year resulted primarily from the higher earnings in compared to  the elimination of goodwill amortization expense beginning in as a permanent difference  extraterritorial income exclusion tax benefits and the release of a valuation allowance related to our state net operating loss carryforwards 
earnings from continuing operations 
earnings from continuing operations in were million  an increase of compared to the million reported in earnings from discontinued operations 
earnings from discontinued operations in of million  net of tax expense of million  resulted from revised environmental liability estimates 
deemed dividend 
the deemed dividend of million in march of resulted from the conversion of all of our outstanding series b redeemable preferred stock into  shares of series d redeemable preferred stock on march  the deemed dividend reflects the difference between the closing market price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on march  and the conversion price of the series d redeemable preferred stock negotiated in december  multiplied by the total number of shares of common stock into which the series d redeemable preferred stock could have been converted on march  preferred stock dividend 
the noncash preferred stock dividends of million paid in resulted from the issuance of  shares of series d redeemable preferred stock in payment of the quarterly payable in kind dividends on the series d redeemable preferred stock  which as of december  were convertible into  shares of common stock 
results of operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net sales 
despite the aviation industry downturn  aviall services net sales increased million or in compared to the increase was primarily due to sales under the new honeywell agreements in and increased rolls royce model product line sales 
sales of products supplied by rolls royce and honeywell were million and million in and  respectively 
sales for aviall services were higher for each major segment of the aviation industry but were mixed by geographic region the americas region increased million or  europe fell million or  and the asia pacific region jumped million or 
ils s net sales decreased million or in compared to primarily due to continued customer acceptance of the annual prepayment discount initiative and the loss of communications revenue as customers migrated to accessing ilsmart 
com through the internet rather than through billable dial up connections 
gross profit 
gross profit of million decreased million or in compared with million in the decrease was due to a million write down of inventory and intangibles offset by sales under the new honeywell agreements in and increased rolls royce model product line sales 
gross profit as a percentage of net sales decreased to in from in a slight increase in gross profit as a percentage of net sales at aviall services  resulting from changes in product mix  was mostly offset by lower margins at ils due to technology infrastructure investment costs 
selling and administrative expenses 
in  our selling and administrative expenses increased million or from primarily due to development expenses for our e commerce initiatives  integration of the new honeywell product lines and expenses to relocate our corporate headquarters and aviall services headquarters and central warehouse operations 
this relocation was completed on time and at a cost of million  which was million less than the estimate previously disclosed 
tax incentives at this new site will allow us to maintain our ad valorem taxes at the rate  even though the tax basis of our assets increased substantially 
unusual loss 
our results included a million unusual loss primarily related to the aviation industry changes resulting from the downturn in the economy in  consisting of million for the write down of unfavorable leases  million for doubtful accounts increases and million in costs related to our new capital structure 
interest expense 
our interest expense increased million in compared to reflecting increased borrowings primarily due to higher working capital requirements associated with the new honeywell product line additions  partially offset by decreased interest rates 
income tax expense 
for  our income tax expense from continuing operations was million  and our effective tax rate was 
this rate exceeded the statutory rate primarily due to the amortization of nondeductible goodwill and foreign taxes in excess of the statutory rate 
for  our income tax expense from continuing operations was million  and our effective tax rate was 
this rate exceeded the statutory rate primarily due to the amortization of nondeductible goodwill 
earnings from continuing operations 
for  earnings from continuing operations were million compared to million in as previously discussed  our results included a million inventory and intangible write down and a million unusual loss related to the economic downturn and costs related to our new capital structure 
earnings from discontinued operations 
earnings from discontinued operations in of million  net of tax expense of million  were due to revised environmental liability estimates 
extraordinary item 
the extraordinary item in  net of income tax benefit of million  resulted from the write off of million of unamortized debt issuance costs related to refinancing our senior credit facility in december foreign operations aviall services operates customer service centers in australia  canada  hong kong  the netherlands  new zealand and singapore  as well as repair facilities in australia and the united kingdom 
these foreign operations use the us dollar as their functional currency because the majority of sales and inventory purchases are denominated in us dollars 
foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses are included in our net earnings 
there are no current legal restrictions regarding the repatriation of cash from the foreign operations to the us however  our general policy is not to repatriate cash 
the following table shows our foreign operations net sales and earnings from continuing operations before income taxes during the periods shown year ended december  in millions net sales earnings from continuing operations before income taxes income taxes cash tax payments made for federal  state and foreign income taxes were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
our cash income tax expense is primarily related to foreign taxes on our foreign operations 
our cash income tax expense continues to be substantially lower than the us federal statutory rate through the use of our us federal net operating loss carryforwards 
as of december   our estimated us federal net operating loss carryforward was approximately million and substantially expires between and we periodically assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets and adjust the related valuation allowance based on the amount of deferred tax assets that we believe is more likely than not to be realized 
in  the valuation allowance decreased million to million primarily due to our determination that million of state tax net operating loss carryforwards could be utilized 
while we believe we will generate sufficient future us federal taxable income to utilize our us net operating loss carryforwards before expiration  we also believe that we may not generate sufficient future taxable income in primarily state and foreign tax jurisdictions to utilize all of our net operating loss carryforwards before their expiration 
to fully utilize our million net deferred tax assets as of december   we must generate million of us federal taxable income  based on current us federal tax rates 
we generated us federal taxable income of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
we will continue to monitor and assess the likelihood of realizing our deferred tax assets 
future changes in the valuation allowance may occur 
liquidity and capital resources overview 
in december  we i sold  shares of series b redeemable preferred stock for cash proceeds of million  ii sold million of the senior notes due and iii entered into a million senior secured credit facility 
the proceeds from these transactions were used to i pay rolls royce million for aftermarket fulfillment rights and the initial payment for rr t inventory  ii repay our former million senior secured revolving credit facility and term loan and iii fund working capital requirements 
convertible participating redeemable preferred stock 
on march  following stockholder approval  our series b redeemable preferred stock was automatically converted into  shares of series d redeemable preferred stock  which as of march  was convertible into  shares of common stock 
upon conversion of the series b redeemable preferred stock  we recorded a million deemed dividend reflecting the difference between the closing market price of our common stock on the new york stock exchange on march  and the conversion price of the series d redeemable preferred stock negotiated in december  multiplied by the total number of shares of common stock into which the series d redeemable preferred stock could have been converted on march  the series d redeemable preferred stock carries a cumulative dividend at an annual rate of 
dividends paid on or prior to december  will be paid in shares of the series d redeemable preferred stock 
thereafter  dividends are payable in cash  to the extent funds are legally available for payment of cash dividends 
if we fail to pay cash dividends after december   we will be required to pay dividends in shares of the series d redeemable preferred stock 
from march  to december   we issued an additional  shares of series d redeemable preferred stock in payment of the quarterly dividends due march   june   september  and december  as of december   there were  shares of series d redeemable preferred stock outstanding  which were convertible into  shares of common stock 
without the prior consent of the holders of our series d redeemable preferred stock  we are prohibited from  among other things  incurring certain types of additional debt  making specified payments and capital expenditures  consolidating  merging with or acquiring another business  or selling certain of our assets 
unless previously converted into common stock  we must redeem all outstanding shares of series d redeemable preferred stock on june  for  per share plus accrued and unpaid dividends  if any 
senior unsecured debt 
the senior notes bear interest at per annum and mature on december   unless previously redeemed at our option 
of the interest rate on the senior notes  is payable in cash and is payable in additional senior notes 
during  we made cash interest payments of million  and the outstanding principal amount on the senior notes increased by million to million 
on march  following stockholder approval  we issued to the lenders warrants exercisable for an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  subject to adjustment for antidilution events  at an exercise price of per share 
we valued the warrants using an option pricing model and recorded an million discount on the senior notes  which is being amortized over the term of the senior notes 
as of december   the unamortized discount was million 
after the issuance of the warrants  the effective interest rate on the senior notes is 
as of december   we have issued  shares of common stock to the lenders pursuant to the exercise of their warrants 
in addition  without the prior consent of the lenders  we are prohibited from  among other things  incurring certain types of additional debt  making specified payments and capital expenditures  consolidating  merging with or acquiring another business  or selling certain of our assets 
we have the option to redeem the senior notes prior to their maturity at a premium 
however  we do not currently intend to refinance the senior notes in unless a significant event  such as the award of another major distribution rights contract  exceeds the borrowing capacity determined by our current borrowing base 
we continue to explore opportunities to acquire additional product lines with a number of major oems 
additionally  we continually review opportunities for acquiring other compatible businesses or operations 
if a strategic acquisition candidate meets our quantitative and qualitative thresholds  it is possible that such a strategic acquisition candidate might require us to refinance both our senior secured debt and the senior notes 
senior secured debt 
our senior secured credit facility  or the credit facility  consists of a million revolving credit and letter of credit facility due as a balloon payment in  with availability determined by reference to a borrowing base calculated using our eligible accounts receivable and inventory and after deducting reserves required by the lenders 
as of december   we had million outstanding on the credit facility and issued letters of credit for million 
we had million available for additional borrowings under the credit facility  and our borrowing base was million as of december  borrowings under the credit facility bear interest  at our option  based upon either a eurodollar rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to depending upon our financial ratios  or a base rate plus an applicable margin ranging from to depending upon the same financial ratios 
we utilize both of these interest rate options 
as of december   the average interest rate on the credit facility was 
a commitment fee of is payable quarterly on the unused portion of the credit facility 
obligations under the credit facility are collateralized by substantially all of our domestic assets and of the stock of each of our foreign subsidiaries 
the credit facility also contains default clauses that permit the acceleration of all amounts due following the maturity of an event of default at the discretion of the lenders  and lock box provisions that apply our cash collections to outstanding borrowings 
based on the terms of the credit facility and pursuant to eitf issue no 
 balance sheet classification of revolving credit agreement obligations involving lock box arrangements  we have classified amounts outstanding under the credit facility as current 
we also maintain a revolving credit facility in canada 
the canadian million credit facility renews yearly in late april and had an outstanding balance at december  equivalent to us million 
debt covenants 
the credit facility contains various restrictive operating and financial covenants  including several that are based on earnings before interest  taxes  depreciation  amortization  extraordinary gains or losses  and one time items  or adjusted ebitda 
our adjusted ebitda for was million  composed of million  million  million and million during the first  second  third and fourth quarters of  respectively 
the following table presents a reconciliation of our adjusted ebitda to earnings from continuing operations for first second third fourth in thousands quarter quarter quarter quarter total earnings from continuing operations      plus income tax expense      interest expense      depreciation and amortization expense      one time items minus noncash gains losses adjusted ebitda      the adjusted ebitda calculation above is prepared in accordance with the terms of the credit facility 
the one time items and noncash gains and losses  which are included in the adjusted ebitda calculation in accordance with the terms of the credit facility  may occur again in the future 
depreciation and amortization expense above excludes debt discount amortization 
adjusted ebitda is presented solely to provide information on our debt covenants and should not be considered an alternative to operating results or cash flows calculated in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
on december   after completing one year under the credit facility  our minimum adjusted ebitda covenant was replaced with a maximum leverage ratio covenant that measures the ratio of our outstanding debt to our adjusted ebitda for the trailing four quarters 
this maximum leverage ratio covenant was initially set at to on december   and it will periodically decline until it reaches to for december  and all periods thereafter 
in addition  beginning december   we must also comply with a minimum interest coverage ratio covenant that measures the ratio of our adjusted ebitda for the trailing four quarters to our interest expense during the trailing four quarters 
the minimum interest coverage ratio covenant was initially set at to on december  and will periodically increase until it reaches to for december  and all periods thereafter 
furthermore  we must maintain a tangible net worth at or above certain levels 
at december   we were required to have a minimum tangible net worth of million 
our tangible net worth covenant will periodically increase until it reaches million on december   at which time it will expire 
finally  we must limit our capital expenditures to no more than million for  million for  which includes allowed carryover spending from  and million for each of  and the senior notes also contain various restrictive financial covenants  several of which are less restrictive than those relating to the credit facility

finally  we must limit our capital expenditures to no more than million for  million for  which includes allowed carryover spending from  and million for each of  and we are currently  and expect to remain  in compliance for at least the next twelve months in all material respects with the covenants in the credit facility and the senior notes 
cash flow 
net cash flow used for operations was million in  million in and million in the increase in compared to resulted primarily from the increase in net earnings derived from the rr t contract and an increase in accounts payable subsequent to the december initial payment for rr t inventory  offset by increased receivables requirements related to the implementation of the rr t contract and higher year end inventory levels because we took advantage of lower inventory prices prior to the price increases implemented by rolls royce 
the decrease in compared to resulted primarily from the december initial payment for the rr t inventory 
aviall services inventory turns improved from turns in december to turns in december due to the addition of the higher turn inventory related to the rr t contract and improved turns in our other inventory product lines since september the days sales outstanding for aviall s receivables improved from days in december to days in december primarily due to the favorable receivable terms in the rr t contract and improved collections 
both the improved inventory turns and receivable collections during contributed to the lower cash use by operations 
capital expenditures were million in  million in  including million for noncash capital expenditures  and million in capital spending in was primarily for system enhancements at both aviall services and ils and requirements related to the implementation of the rr t contract 
the increased capital spending in compared to was related to planned technology projects ongoing from at both aviall services and ils that were substantially completed in  along with costs related to the relocation of our corporate headquarters and aviall services headquarters and central warehouse operations 
as a result of our better than expected operating performance  we requested and were granted amendments to the credit facility and the senior notes that enabled us to increase our total permitted capital spending from million to million for we expect capital expenditures  including noncash capital expenditures  will be million for during  we paid approximately million for the right to sell additional products under our honeywell esa and ecs distribution agreement and will amortize the million for these additional distribution rights over the remaining eight years of this agreement 
in december  we paid approximately million to purchase the right to sell parts for rr t series engines  which will be amortized over the ten year term of the agreement 
in march  we entered into an agreement to sell honeywell esa and ecs parts 
in june  we entered into an agreement with honeywell to sell honeywell fuel control parts used in rr t series engines 
we will amortize approximately million of the cost for the distribution rights under these honeywell agreements over the ten year term of these agreements 
in december  we entered into an agreement to sell honeywell fuel control products for the rolls royce model and honeywell lt series engines and will amortize million of the cost for the distribution rights under this agreement over the ten year term of the agreement 
net cash flow provided by financing activities was million in  million in and million in the large increase in related to additional borrowings to finance the initial payment for the rr t agreement and the two new honeywell parts distribution agreements 
in summary  our cash used for operating activities improved by million to million during compared to this was after investing million in working capital  defined as receivables  inventories and accounts payable  in compared to million in in  we invested million in distribution rights and net capital expenditures compared to million in the combined deficit in of million for both operating and investing activities was funded by drawing million on our debt facility  net of debt issue costs paid  increasing our cash overdraft position by million and issuing million of common stock  which also increased our cash on hand by million 
the combined deficit in of million for both operating and investing activities was funded by drawing million on our debt facility  net of debt issue costs paid  issuing million of redeemable preferred stock and using million of our available cash  partially offset by a million decrease in our cash overdraft position 
our cash flow during was stronger than  resulting  we believe  from the investments in the new distribution contracts and infrastructure 
while there is no certainty that this improvement will continue  we project cash flow in from operating activities and after investing activities will exceed million 
as expected  our interest expense has more than doubled in due to higher borrowings  amortization of higher debt issuance costs and debt discount and the issuance of the senior notes 
we believe our cash flow from operations and available credit under the credit facility are sufficient to meet our anticipated normal working capital and operating needs  including increased interest expense  for at least the next months 
contractual obligations 
the following table sets forth our contractual obligations at the end of for the periods shown dollars in thousands within contractual obligation total year years years thereafter debt     capital lease obligations    operating leases      purchase commitments   total contractual cash obligations      the million purchase commitment arises from contractual obligations to purchase inventory from rolls royce in pursuant to the terms of two distribution contracts  the rr t agreement and the rolls royce model agreement 
based on our sales projections  we believe these inventory purchases will be consumed in the normal course of business maintaining acceptable inventory turns 
environmental matters aviall services business includes parts repair operations that require the use  storage and disposal of certain chemicals in small quantities 
these chemicals are regulated under various federal  state  local or foreign environmental protection laws  which require us to eliminate or mitigate the impact of these substances on the environment 
in response to these requirements  we have upgraded facilities and implemented programs to detect and minimize contamination 
due to the small quantities of chemicals used and the current programs in place  we do not anticipate any material environmental liabilities or significant capital expenditures will be incurred in the future related to our ongoing operations to comply or remain in compliance with existing environmental regulations 
additionally  some of the products  such as chemicals  oxygen generators  oxygen bottles and life rafts  sold by aviall services contain hazardous materials that are subject to faa regulations and various federal  state  local or foreign environmental protections laws 
if aviall services ships such products by air  it shares responsibility with the air carrier for compliance with these faa regulations and is primarily responsible for the proper packaging and labeling of these items 
if aviall services mislabels or otherwise improperly ships hazardous materials  it may be liable for damage to the aircraft and other property  as well as substantial monetary penalties 
any of these events could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
the faa actively monitors the shipment of hazardous materials 
certain of our previously owned businesses used certain chemicals classified by various federal  state  local or foreign agencies as hazardous substances 
we retain environmental liabilities related to these businesses for the period prior to their sale 
we are involved in various stages of investigation  cleanup  maintenance and closure to comply with federal  state  local or foreign regulations at these locations 
the primary locations are dallas forest park  texas  dallas love field  texas  irving carter field  texas  mcallen  texas  and prestwick  scotland 
we completed required remediation on soil and ground water issues and received state agency closure letters requiring no further action for the carter field  mcallen and prestwick  scotland locations 
the former forest park facility received a closure letter with a five year continuing care plan that only includes ground water sampling 
in addition  we submitted a conceptual exposure assessment model as well as a response action work plan for the love field location to the state agency  both of which were approved  and we expect to receive a closure letter with continuing care from the state agency in the second quarter of based on the current information available  we believe existing environmental financial reserves for these previously owned properties are sufficient 
in addition  we are in litigation with a previous owner of three of these locations as to their potential shared liability associated with the cleanup of these sites 
due to the uncertainty of recoverability of this claim  we have not recorded a receivable 
all other insurance claims for these properties have been settled 
we have been named a potentially responsible party under the comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and the superfund amendments and reauthorization act at five third party disposal sites to which wastes were allegedly sent by the previous owner of assets used in our discontinued engine services operations 
we did not use these identified disposal sites 
accordingly  the previous owner has retained  and has been discharging  all liability associated with the cleanup of these sites pursuant to the sales agreement 
although we could be potentially liable in the event of nonperformance by the previous owner  we do not currently anticipate nonperformance 
based on this information  we have not accrued for any costs associated with these third party sites 
we have been named a potentially responsible party for certain hazardous waste cleanup at miami international airport 
we have preliminarily investigated our responsibilities utilizing a local engineering firm in the miami area 
based on the investigation to date  we believe our exposure for remediation costs  if any  will not be material 
local authorities are currently researching and negotiating with potentially responsible parties 
all probable costs are estimated and accrued in environmental reserves 
at december  and  accrued environmental liabilities related to previously owned businesses were million and  respectively 
no environmental expense related to our ongoing business was recorded in  or however  a gain was recorded in december related to revised estimates for businesses previously owned 
this included a million pretax unusual gain recorded to continuing operations and a million net of tax gain recorded to discontinued operations 
in  we expect to spend  and charge against our existing accrued environmental reserves  million for monitoring and remediating environmental liabilities at previously owned businesses 
the ultimate cost of our environmental liabilities has been estimated  including exit costs related to previously owned businesses 
changes in estimates of these retained environmental liabilities are classified as unusual items in continuing operations or as discontinued operations depending on the accounting treatment that applied at the time the decision was made to exit the business 
based on information presently available and programs to detect and minimize contamination  we believe the ultimate disposition of pending environmental matters related to our previously owned businesses will not have a material adverse effect on our results of operations  cash flows or financial condition 
however  certain environmental matters could be material to our cash flows during any one year 
our reserves for environmental liabilities are estimates 
we do not expect the estimated environmental remediation expense with respect to the ongoing business to be material in the foreseeable future based on the nature of the activities presently conducted 
new accounting pronouncements during january of  the financial accounting standards board  or fasb  issued interpretation no 
 or fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin provides guidance for companies having ownership of variable interest entities  typically referred to as special purpose entities  in determining whether to consolidate such variable interest entities 
fin has immediate applicability for variable interest entities created after january  or interests in variable interest entities obtained after that date 
for interests in variable interest entities obtained prior to february   fin becomes effective on july  because we do not hold an interest in an entity governed by the pronouncement  we do not believe the adoption will have a significant effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations

the most significant impact of sfas is to eliminate the requirement that gains and losses from the extinguishment of debt be classified as an extraordinary item unless these items are infrequent and unusual in nature 
we adopted sfas as of january  upon adoption of sfas  we reclassified our previously reported extraordinary items  which relate to early extinguishment of debt  as a component of earnings before income taxes 
outlook we participate in the global aviation aftermarket through aviall services and ils 
our operations and results of operations are affected by the general economic climate  particularly as it influences flight activity in the government military  commercial airline and general aviation corporate segments 
we benefit from our participation in all aviation segments and most particularly in the global aviation aftermarket where we generate revenue from the aviation sectors of many countries other than those in north america 
the demand for commercial air transport has been reduced due to the prevailing global economic slowdown 
this lower flight activity  which has promoted accelerated retirement of older aircraft and caused the deferral of nonessential aircraft maintenance and overhaul services  has reduced demand for some of the new replacement parts we sell 
in addition  some air operations have been reduced because commercial airlines  air freight carriers and other commercial airline related firms around the world are experiencing large financial losses 
these losses have resulted in several bankruptcies  which detrimentally affect the future business prospects of the affected companies  as well as the prospects for many that perform related business services for these companies 
while we believe our reserves for doubtful accounts are adequate  we could be negatively affected if our receivables from several of our major customers become uncollectible 
we regularly review our exposure to these customers to determine appropriate credit limits and loss reserve amounts  if any  that should be recorded to cover our risk of loss  as well as determining other strategies that could minimize exposure in the case of bankruptcy 
during the third quarter of  us airways group and vanguard airlines each filed for bankruptcy protection 
during the fourth quarter of  united airlines filed for bankruptcy and us airways group filed a plan of reorganization 
aviall services net sales to these customers combined during were less than million 
we believe our reserves for our accounts receivable as of december  are adequate to cover our exposure to these customers 
the length of time required for a recovery of the global commercial aviation sector is not known  and the recovery could be threatened by a number of factors  including slower economic growth  foreign political instability  or acts of war or terrorism 
generally  corporate and general aviation flight activity remained relatively stable during  with the exception of piston engine aircraft  which experienced a slowdown 
at the same time  the us military and certain foreign militaries  which utilize airframes powered by the rr t engine  have significantly increased their flight activities in connection with increased military and other government sponsored operations around the world 
our rr t military business has materially benefited us by broadening our product offering and offsetting the continuing slowdown in commercial aviation 
in  we have a purchase commitment to rolls royce that requires us to purchase million of rr t parts 
we also have a similar requirement to purchase not less than million of rolls royce model series gas turbine parts 
based on our current plans and our sales and marketing activities  we expect to fulfill these obligations in the ordinary course of business 
we have no future contractual inventory purchase commitments beyond except those required under normal purchasing lead times 
both of the rolls royce contracts continue to meet our revenue expectations 
in addition  we expect the current sales levels under these contracts to continue into the foreseeable future 
in  aviall services net sales were derived approximately from government military sales  from general aviation corporate sales and from commercial airline sales 
if aviall services net sales in included the million of rr t sales made directly by rolls royce to the us military  aviall services net sales would have been derived approximately from government military sales  from general aviation corporate sales and from commercial airline sales 
this change in our sales mix was reflected in the increase in sales by aviall services  which in turn was mostly attributable to the acquisition of the distribution agreement for the rr t series engine 
while we are pursuing a number of opportunities  we do not have any immediate prospects that could represent an opportunity of similar magnitude in or beyond 
accordingly  our sales are unlikely to grow by a similar amount over the next months 
while our revenue in increased by  our selling and administrative expenses experienced only an or million increase 
this demonstrates our belief that both ils and aviall services are scalable businesses with significant portions of their expenses being relatively fixed in the short term 
this scalability produces positive results in a growing marketplace as evidenced by the impact of the rr t agreement 
in  ils experienced a slight decrease in commercial airline related subscribers  however  this decrease was partially offset by an increase in the number of government related and general aviation corporate subscribers 
as a result  ils has not experienced a material adverse impact on its business as a result of the economic downturn experienced in ils is continuing to develop  evolve and improve its electronic marketplace offerings to mitigate the prolonged effects of the economic downturn and to improve its competitiveness 
however  to do this  it has to  among other things  adapt various software packages to meet the needs of its customers 
the software packages are extremely complex and do not always provide the flexibility required by ils s customer base 
therefore  the deployment of the software requires significant alterations  which may cause ils to incur unplanned  potentially significant costs 
information and communications technology is evolving rapidly and developments with respect to the internet could affect companies such as ils and traditional distribution companies 
we believe our active deployment of innovative technologies on our websites  aviall 
com and ilsmart 
com  will enable us to maintain our technological leadership position and minimize the risk of obsolescence 
there have been many attempts to compete with ils  but most of these enterprises have since ceased operations 
however  there continues to be new entrants in the e commerce marketplace arena  including oems  distributors and independent companies  that are competing  or are expected to compete  with ils 
these competitors maintain pressure on prices  sometimes confuse customers and potential customers and as a result can harm ils s prospects and raise ils s costs 
while we do not expect these competitive pressures to abate  ils is responding by raising the quality and the number of services it offers  which may have the effect of raising the levels of investment  complexity and sophistication that competitors would have to meet to match ils s offering 
ils is in the implementation stage of its ongoing program to evolve ilsmart 
com by upgrading its infrastructure and customer applications 
ils s plans for include expanding its products  the ils inventory e valuator and ils quick catalogue  as well as introducing ils bid alerts  a system that notifies suppliers when the us government issues bid requests for items that meet the suppliers preset criteria 
we plan to upgrade our enterprise resources planning software during to our current supplier s latest version 
we plan to use internal resources  as well as the supplier and other outside software consultants  to implement the upgrade by the end of the fourth quarter of to mitigate the risks associated with the implementation  we have installed a full hardware and software test environment  separate from our operating environment  to thoroughly test and validate the upgrade 
while we have experience with the software and a detailed implementation plan  all software implementations of this complexity have inherent risks 
we believe our plan mitigates any potential major disruption to our business from implementing the upgrade 
we expect net earnings from continuing operations in to be in the range of million to million and  correspondingly  earnings per share from continuing operations to be to per share basic and diluted 
additionally  we anticipate our cash flow from operating activities and after investing activities in to be in excess of million  which will be used to pay down debt 
our estimated required pension contribution could be as high as million 
however  we continue to pursue opportunities for additional product lines or acquisitions 
if one or more of these opportunities are completed during  these funds will be required to finance them 
during  we have the option to redeem the senior notes at of the principal amount outstanding 
a decision to refinance the senior notes could depend on several factors  including the availability of replacement financing sources  the cost of replacement debt and the occurrence of a significant event such as the award of another major distribution rights contract  which might exceed our borrowing base capacity 
if we decide to refinance the senior notes  the costs of such a refinancing would include the prepayment premium on the senior notes 
in addition  all unamortized deferred costs related to the senior notes  which includes the debt discount and original debt issuance costs  would be required to be written off 
with the adoption of sfas  these unamortized costs  along with the prepayment premium  would be included in earnings from continuing operations instead of being treated as an extraordinary item net of tax 
the earnings per share estimates provided above do not include any charges which may arise from refinancing the senior notes

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
from time to time  we have used financial instruments to offset these risks 
these financial instruments are not used for trading or speculative purposes 
we did not experience any significant changes in market risk during our earnings are affected by changes in short term interest rates as a result of borrowings under our bank credit facility  which bear interest based on floating rates 
prior to  we entered into interest rate caps  swaps and other similar instruments to reduce the impact of fluctuation in interest rates on our floating rate debt 
as of december  and  we did not have any interest rate hedges in place 
at december   we had million of variable rate debt obligations outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
a hypothetical change in the effective interest rate for these borrowings or approximately basis points  assuming debt levels at december   would change interest expense by approximately million 
our foreign operations utilize the us dollar as their functional currency 
foreign currency translation and transaction gains and losses are included in net earnings 
foreign currency transaction exposure relates primarily to foreign currency denominated accounts receivables and the transfer of foreign currency from subsidiaries to aviall services 
we have sales transactions denominated in foreign currencies in australia  canada and new zealand 
currency transaction exposures are not hedged 
unrealized currency translation gains and losses are recognized each month upon translation of the foreign subsidiaries balance sheets into us dollars 
from time to time  we have used foreign currency borrowings as a hedge against foreign denominated net assets 
as of december  and  we had a canadian dollar denominated loan equivalent to us million and us million  respectively
