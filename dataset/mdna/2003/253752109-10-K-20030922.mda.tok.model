item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of our financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and the related notes to such consolidated financial statements also included in this form k 
some of the information that follows are not statements of historical fact but merely reflect our intent  belief or expectations regarding the anticipated effect of events  circumstances and trends 
such statements should be considered as forward looking statements within the meaning of the private securities litigation reform act of we believe that our expectations are based on reasonable assumptions within the bounds of our knowledge of our business and operations 
factors that might cause or contribute to differences between our expectations and actual results include uncertainty of market acceptance of our products by the worldwide medical community  dependence on third party reimbursement from government entities  managed care organizations  and private insurance plans  our ability to scale up our manufacturing to the extent product sales increase  our limited sales and marketing experience  the extent of future expenditures for sales and marketing programs  uncertainty of clinical trial results for our products in development  risk that other companies may develop and market hpv tests competitive with our own  uncertainty regarding patents and propriety rights in connection with our products and products in development  delay in or failure to obtain regulatory approvals for our products in development  uncertainty of future profitability and cash generation from operations  our ability  if necessary  to obtain requisite additional financing to fund our operations beyond calendar year  risks inherent in international transactions  including those relating to our expansion in europe and elsewhere  and other factors as set forth under the caption additional considerations beginning on page overview since our incorporation in  we have devoted substantially all of our resources to developing  manufacturing and marketing our proprietary gene based testing systems using our patented hybrid capture technology for the screening  monitoring and diagnosis of human diseases 
since our inception  we have incurred substantial operating losses  resulting principally from expenses associated with our research and development programs  including preclinical studies  clinical trials and regulatory submissions for our products  the expansion of our manufacturing facilities and our global sales and marketing activities 
our revenues have been derived primarily from the sales of our hpv tests  which  for fiscal  accounted for of total revenues 
we expect that the growing acceptance of our hpv tests in both the united states and abroad will continue to drive the growth in revenues from our hpv tests in the future 
in fiscal  our gross margins improved substantially over the prior fiscal year 
in fiscal  we believe that we will be able to sustain gross margins consistent with  or better than  fiscal as we continue to scale up our manufacturing operations and realize expanded margins as a result of our direct distribution efforts in europe 
we believe that continuing to substantially increase our investment in sales and marketing and in research and development is essential to allow us to capitalize more fully on the potential of our hpv tests and our core technology 
we will continue to invest heavily in our direct sales organization and marketing activities in the united states while also expanding our direct european distribution operation 
we also expect to moderately increase our expenditures in the development of our next generation hybrid capture and platforms and clinical trial activities for human papillomavirus screening in the coming fiscal year as compared to fiscal our sales and marketing expenditures have been and will continue to be focused on accelerating the adoption of human papillomavirus testing worldwide 
we intend to capitalize on the growing acceptance of our hpv tests in the united states and internationally by physicians  laboratories and health insurance providers by materially increasing expenditures on sales and marketing over the next several quarters 
the increase in expenditures will be primarily directed at expanded direct sales and marketing efforts in the united states and europe 
we expect our general and administrative expenses will increase to provide adequate infrastructure for our sales and marketing activities  to pay the anticipated expenses associated with our ongoing litigation matters  to support greater research and development activities and to support the overall growth of our business 
despite these anticipated increases in expenditures  we expect the turn to profitability we achieved in the fourth quarter of fiscal to continue through fiscal driven by continued strong gross margins 
there can be no assurance that we will meet this goal 
results of operations comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  product sales increased over to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to a growth in sales of our hpv tests over such sales in the corresponding period in fiscal  partially offset by decreases in sales of equipment and certain non core products 
the majority of the growth in hpv product sales was in the united states over such sales in the corresponding period in fiscal and in europe over such sales in the corresponding period in fiscal 
during fiscal  we did not recognize any revenue related to minimum purchase guarantees under the roche distribution contract  whereas in fiscal we recognized approximately  please see liquidity and capital resources below for a description of the roche distribution contract 
other revenues included research and development contract revenues  equipment rental revenues and licensing revenues 
other revenues decreased almost to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the decrease was due primarily to a reduction in research and development services revenue and licensing revenue 
the decrease was partially offset by the recognition of certain equipment sales to roche in europe which were initially deferred in the fourth quarter of fiscal please see liquidity and capital resources below for a description of the roche distribution contract 
cost of product sales increased by to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal gross margins on product sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage primarily related to increased sales of our higher margin reagent test kits  particularly hpv tests  principally in the united states  as well as decreased sales of lower margin equipment products 
cost of product sales was negatively impacted in fiscal because of a voluntary product recall  resulting in a charge to cost of product sales of approximately  during february we initiated a voluntary recall involving our hc hpv dna and chlamydia  or ct  tests 
this recall was limited to certain product lots which were manufactured using a specific lot of raw material that had the potential to cause false positive patient specimen results 
we informed the us food and drug administration fda of the recall 
we conducted an investigation into the root cause of this product performance issue for the hc product line  and developed a raw material release testing corrective action plan 
on june   the fda approved the modification of our lot release testing procedures related to the component that relied on the raw material found to have been contaminated 
because this voluntary recall was limited to a certain identified lot of raw material  we were able to supply our customers with product manufactured from acceptable raw material lots 
in addition  we have expanded our ongoing quality improvement program to ensure continued reliability as manufacturing volume increases to meet anticipated growth in demand for our hpv tests 
research and development expenses increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase in expenses was due primarily to a increase in professional services and clinical trial expenses  to approximately  partially offset by a decrease in personnel costs  which decreased to approximately  and laboratory supplies  which decreased to approximately  the increase in professional services is due largely to costs incurred in preparation for compliance with the european union in vitro diagnostic directive ivdd regulations 
we expect that compliance with the european union ivdd regulations will continue to require investment during fiscal our research and development activities focus on our platform technology  including different or modified uses of such technology  and improvements to our diagnostic test and equipment products 
because our research and development expenditures tend to benefit multiple product offerings  we do not track and maintain research and development expenses on a per product or per disease target basis 
during fiscal  we focused our research and development activities on completing regulatory activities to add new claims and indications to existing products in the us and abroad  support and improvement of existing product lines  the development of several new products and core research efforts for next generation technologies 
work is continuing on the development of a hybrid capture hpv test application for our automated rapid capture system  including accommodating the use of multiple dna probes in a single run in conjunction with our current product lines  the development of methods to improve specimen processing procedures and throughput  including procedures for the improved processing of cytyc corporation s thinprep specimens for hpv  ct and gc testing  improved equipment for faster specimen processing  and the development of our universal collection medium  or ucm  that is expected to allow simultaneous testing for hpv  ct gc and of other genetic and cellular material from a single patient sample 
verification was completed and clinical trials are in process for a method for converting specimens collected in tripath imaging s surepath liquid cytology medium 
clinical trials are also underway to validate ct gc testing from cytyc s thinprep specimens  an hpv application for the rapid capture system  and a procedural modification to our hc assay designed to improve test robustness 
work was completed on an hpv thinprep application using cervical specimens collected with a brush spatula device and the data has been submitted to the fda 
development is continuing on our next generation of hybrid capture technology  initially for the improved detection of hpv and the evaluation of certain molecular markers to complement our hpv tests in cervical screening applications 
we are continuing several basic research programs with the goal of developing improved molecular diagnostic assay systems for the detection of hpv and other targets of interest in the area of women s cancers and infectious diseases 
as part of our research and development activities  we submitted a pma supplement amendment to the fda in september to obtain market approval for the use of our hc hpv test in conjunction with the pap test for adjunctive screening for women age and older 
we worked closely with the fda and received an approval on march  this product indication is being marketed in the united states under the trade name dnawithpap test 
selling and marketing expenses increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase in fiscal was due primarily to personnel costs  which increased to approximately  and royalty expenses  which increased to approximately  in addition  depreciation expense increased to approximately  in fiscal due primarily to the may repurchase of equipment from abbott laboratories abbott upon expiration of the non exclusive wind down period of our distribution agreement with abbott the abbott agreement 
additionally  professional services increased to approximately  due largely to the use of consultants to assist with the rapid growth of our distribution infrastructure in europe 
geographically  the majority of the increase in our selling and marketing expenses for fiscal  excluding royalties  was incurred in europe  which increased to approximately  over the corresponding period in fiscal as we established subsidiaries  hired employees and continued to develop a distribution infrastructure 
we expect our selling and marketing expenses to increase during fiscal as we expand our direct sales and marketing activities in the united states to increase hpv product sales  including the new indication  dnawithpap used in conjunction with the pap test  commercialize our ct gc products and continue the build up of our direct sales and marketing operations in europe 
as part of our commercialization program for the dnawithpap test  we have contracted to establish a person detailing sales organization with pdi  inc dedicated to promoting the dnawithpap test to physicians 
we expect to continue to increase our investment in physician education to promote the commercialization of the dnawithpap test 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to professional fees  which increased to approximately  primarily related to costs associated with litigation matters  personnel costs  which increased to approximately  and insurance  which increased to approximately  principally related to increased costs for directors and officers insurance coverage 
these increases were partially offset by a decrease in bad debt expense of  during fiscal due to strong collection efforts of outstanding receivables 
geographically  the majority of the increase in general and administrative expenses for fiscal was incurred in europe  which increased to approximately  over the corresponding period in fiscal due to our change to direct distribution  and in the united states  which increased over the corresponding period in fiscal to approximately  due primarily to the aforementioned litigation expenditures 
interest income decreased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in average cash balances and lower interest rates in fiscal compared to the corresponding period in fiscal interest expense increased to approximately  in fiscal compared to approximately  in fiscal primarily due to interest on long term debt due to abbott as part of the repurchase of equipment at the end of fiscal  and interest on the note due to roche as a result of the repurchase of inventory from roche in january other income increased to approximately  in fiscal from a loss of approximately  in fiscal primarily due to foreign exchange gains and losses 
comparison of fiscal year ended june  to fiscal year ended june  product sales increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to an growth in sales of our hpv tests and testing services over such sales in the corresponding period in fiscal  partially offset by decreases in sales of equipment and non core products 
the majority of the growth in hpv products sales was in the united states over such sales in the corresponding period in fiscal and in europe over such sales in the corresponding period in fiscal 
during fiscal  we recognized revenue of approximately  related to minimum purchase guarantees under the roche distribution contract as compared to approximately  in fiscal please see liquidity and capital resources below for a description of the roche distribution contract 
other revenues included research and development contract revenues  equipment rental revenues and licensing revenues 
other revenues increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to the recognition of equipment sales in europe which were initially deferred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  and additional research and development revenue under an existing contract  partially offset by a reduction in licensing revenue under an exclusive contract  which was converted to non exclusive during fiscal cost of product sales marginally increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal gross margins on product sales increased to in fiscal from in fiscal the increase in gross margin percentage primarily related to increased sales of our hpv test products  principally in the united states where we sold such products directly in fiscal  and decreased sales of lower margin equipment products  as well as the elimination  by the first quarter of fiscal  of certain expenses associated with the relocation to our new manufacturing facility in april which negatively impacted our gross margins during fiscal  improved inventory management and the recognition of minimum purchase guarantees by roche  partially offset by european value added taxes on inventory purchases 
research and development expenses increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase in expenses was due primarily to personnel costs  which increased  professional services and clinical trial expenses  which increased and laboratory supplies  which increased 
during fiscal  we focused our research and development activities principally on the development of our rapid capture system for automated processing of our hybrid capture tests  initially related to hpv and ct gc  activities related to the preparation of a pma supplement that we submitted to the us food and drug administration fda in october to obtain market approval for the dnawithpap test which involves the use of our hc hpv test as a primary cervical cancer screening test to be performed in conjunction with the pap test for women age and older  which was subsequently approved on march   the development of our universal collection medium ucm that is expected to allow the simultaneous testing for hpv  chlamydia and gonorrhea and of other genetic and cellular material from a single patient sample  clinical trials related to ct gc testing from cytyc s preservcyt specimens and hpv testing from the tripath imaging s surepath specimens  and the creation of our next generation of hybrid capture technology 
selling and marketing expenses increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to various marketing programs and associated professional expenses  which increased  royalty costs  which increased  and personnel costs  which increased 
in fiscal  we retained the services of an advertising agency 
all of the costs associated with this agency were treated as advertising costs 
general and administrative expenses increased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the increase was due primarily to professional fees  which increased  and personnel costs  which increased 
the increase in professional fees was primarily attributable to legal and accounting fees associated with our proposed merger with cytyc corporation  as well as our litigation proceedings with ventana medical systems  inc and with enzo biochem  inc 
and its subsidiary  enzo diagnostics  inc in addition  in june  we determined the balance outstanding on the promissory note with kd medical  inc was uncollectible and took a charge against operations for the unpaid principal and accrued interest of approximately  in connection with an amendment to the abbott agreement  on january   digene issued  shares of common stock to abbott in a private placement transaction representing an agreed upon termination fee paid to abbott as consideration for the termination of abbott s exclusive rights to sell our chlamydia and gonorrhea products worldwide 
digene recognized a one time expense of  in the third quarter of fiscal representing the fair market value of the shares issued to abbott in this transaction 
interest income decreased to approximately  in fiscal from approximately  in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower interest rates in fiscal compared to the corresponding period in fiscal the cash received from roche associated with advance minimum payments was held in an account that did not provide interest income to digene 
liquidity and capital resources since inception  our expenses have significantly exceeded our revenues  resulting in an accumulated deficit of approximately  at june  we have funded our operations primarily through the sale of equity securities and revenues from product sales and research and development contracts 
at june   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments aggregating approximately  we had negative cash flows from operations of approximately  for the year ending june  compared to negative cash flows from operations of approximately  for the year ending june  the negative cash flow for the year ending june  was primarily the result of non recurring payments to professionals related to our terminated merger transaction with cytyc corporation  all of which were accrued during fiscal  in addition to net loss for the period 
positive cash flows from financing activities for the year ending june  are primarily the result of a private offering of  shares of common stock on january   the net proceeds of which  after expenses  were approximately  capital expenditures increased to approximately  for the year ended june  from approximately  for the corresponding period in fiscal a substantial portion of the capital expenditures in fiscal related to our repurchase of equipment from roche  as described below 
the capital expenditures for the year ended june  do not reflect the application of the remaining deferred revenues and deferred costs  which had been on the balance sheet related to the fiscal year sale of equipment to roche  more fully described below 
on april   we entered into a letter agreement with roche molecular systems the roche distribution contract  which established roche molecular systems roche as the co exclusive distributor of our human papillomavirus hpv products in europe  africa and the middle east from may  through june  in june  we adopted as our sole strategy for the distribution of our hpv products in europe  africa and the middle east  a combination of direct distribution through its european infrastructure and the use of local distributors and agents 
on june   the term of the roche distribution contract expired  subject to a non exclusive wind down period 
under the roche distribution contract  we had the option  exercisable within days after december   to buy back from roche equipment purchased from us by roche and in use for hpv testing in customer s laboratories on june  in june  as part of our strategic decision  we decided that we would exercise the option to repurchase the equipment 
in recognition of the decision to repurchase the equipment  commencing in the fourth quarter of  we deferred recognition of equipment sold to roche 
equipment sold during this time period had a sales price of million and a cost of million  which amounts were recorded as deferred revenue and deferred costs  respectively 
the deferred revenue and deferred costs were being amortized over a four year period to other revenue as equipment rental and selling and marketing expenses  respectively 
for fiscal  we recorded other revenue and selling and marketing expenses of  and  respectively related to the amortization of these balances 
for fiscal  we recorded other revenue and selling and marketing expenses of  and  respectively  related to the amortization of these balances prior to the commencement of the repurchase 
at december   when amortization ceased  the remaining deferred revenue and deferred cost balances were  and  respectively  for a remaining net credit as of december  of  on december   we amended the roche distribution contract to terminate the wind down period on december  and to establish the procedures for our repurchase from roche of hpv related testing equipment purchased from us by roche under the roche distribution contract 
the repurchase price for the equipment in use for hpv testing in customers laboratories is the equipments december  depreciated value  which is the net selling price less any amounts roche recorded as depreciation based on a straight line basis over a four year period 
the repurchase price for the equipment in inventory is a discount from the transfer price paid by roche under the roche distribution contract 
the parties consummated the hpv equipment repurchase on january   subject to reconciliation 
in january digene and its affiliates paid roche an aggregate of approximately million for the hpv equipment in inventory and in use at customers laboratories in europe 
a portion of the purchase price was paid by the issuance of a note payable due to roche  which will be paid in one installment in january  and the remainder of the purchase price was paid in cash 
a final settlement for the repurchased assets was completed with roche in june the total consideration paid to roche for the fixed assets and inventory after reaching a final settlement was  or  after consideration of the remaining net credit of  mentioned above 
we anticipate that working capital requirements will increase moderately for the foreseeable future due to the investment necessary to support our european direct distribution operations  including the january buy back from roche of equipment in europe  as well as increasing accounts receivable as a result of expected revenue growth 
we have incurred negative cash flows from operations since our inception  and have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds to complete our planned product development efforts  expand our sales and marketing activities and expand our manufacturing capabilities 
we expect that our existing capital resources will be adequate to fund our operations through fiscal our future capital requirements and the adequacy of available funds may change  however  based on numerous factors  including our degree of success in commercializing our products  progress in our product development efforts and the magnitude and scope of such efforts  progress with preclinical studies and clinical trials  progress in our regulatory affairs activities  the cost and timing of expansion of our manufacturing capabilities  the development and maintenance of effective sales and marketing activities  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  and the development and maturation of strategic alliances for the marketing of our products 
to the extent that our existing capital resources and funds generated from operations are insufficient to meet current or planned operating requirements  we will be required to obtain additional funds through equity or debt financing  strategic alliances with corporate partners and others  or through other sources 
we do not have any committed sources of additional financing  and there can be no assurance that additional funding  if necessary  will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to delay  scale back or eliminate certain aspects of our operations or attempt to obtain funds through arrangements with collaborative partners or others that may require us to relinquish rights to certain of our technologies  product candidates  products or potential markets 
under such conditions  our business  financial condition and results of operations will be materially adversely affected 
we have summarized below our material contractual obligations as of june  in thousands less than one one to three four to five contractual year years years after five years obligations total fiscal fiscal fiscal after fiscal long term debt operating leases total contractual cash obligations critical accounting policies and the use of estimates we prepare our financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
such accounting principles require that our management make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and accompanying notes 
our actual results could differ materially from those estimates 
the items in our consolidated financial statements that have required us to make significant estimates and judgments are as follows inventory management 
our inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market 
cost is determined using a weighted average approach  which approximates the first in first out method of inventory management 
we also record provisions for inventories which may not be salable due to anticipated trends in sales volume and or pricing and our estimates of net realizable value 
these provisions are determined based on significant estimates 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales when there is persuasive evidence that an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed and determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
we establish allowances for estimated uncollectible amounts  product returns and discounts based on historical default rates and specifically identified problem accounts 
accounting for employee stock options 
we account for our employee stock based compensation in accordance with the provisions of apb no 
 and related interpretations  which allow us to recognize compensation costs for the excess of the estimated fair value of the stock option at the grant date over the exercise price  if any 
an alternative method of accounting would apply the principles of sfas no 
which require the fair value of the stock option to be recognized at the date of grant and amortized to compensation expense over the stock options vesting period 
had we applied the principles of sfas no 
for our employee options  our net loss would have been approximately   and  during our fiscal years ended june   and instead of our reported net loss which approximated   and  respectively 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk associated with changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates 
our exchange rate risk comes from our operations in europe and south america 
the net impact of foreign exchange activities on earnings was not material for the years ended june   and interest rate exposure is primarily limited to the million of cash  cash equivalents and short and long term investments owned by us 
such securities are debt instruments that generate interest income for us on cash balances 
we do not actively manage the risk of interest rate fluctuations  however  such risk is mitigated by the relatively short term nature  less than twelve months  of certain investments 
we do not consider the present rate of inflation to have a significant impact on our business
