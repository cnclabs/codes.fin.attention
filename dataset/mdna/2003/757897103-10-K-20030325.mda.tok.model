during  the merchant card services segment net income decreased due to an increase in salary and benefits expenses 
the increase in the unit s salary and benefits expense is due to a build up in sales development personnel 
the increase in expenses was partially offset by an increase in processing revenue brought about by the company s efforts to build its overall merchant card services business through direct marketing efforts  new iso relationships and an increase in the realization in deferred processing revenue associated with certain merchants 
during  the merchant card services segment s net income declined due to a decline in processing revenue  which is directly attributable to the expiration of a large merchant credit card processing contract in the fourth quarter of in and  the segment had experienced two successive years of revenue and earnings growth due to an increase in the number of merchants it services and an increase of isos to market its services 
in december  the company renegotiated the terms of a processing contract with an iso who represented  or of the company s merchant draft net processing revenue   or   or and  or of such revenue in  and as a result of the renegotiation the iso brought down its processing rate in consideration for a payment of  to the company

due to a contractual obligation between nbr and visa and mastercard  nbr stands in the place of the merchant in the event that a merchant is unable to pay charge backs from cardholders 
as a result of this obligation  nbr may incur losses associated with its merchant credit card processing business 
accordingly  nbr has established a reserve to provide for losses associated with charge back losses 
such reserve  which totaled  and  as of december  and  was estimated based upon industry loss data as a percentage of transaction volume throughout each year  historical losses incurred by nbr  and management s assumptions regarding merchant and iso risk 
the provision for charge back losses  which is included in the financial statements as a reduction in merchant draft processing income  was   and  in  and the relatively higher level of the provision during reflects the growth in proprietary merchant account volume  increased exposure to internet merchants  and a new iso relationship in which the company assumed fraud risk directly rather than looking first to the iso

the interest rates charged for the loans made by the company vary with the degree of risk  the size and maturity of the loans  the borrowers depository relationships with the company and prevailing money market rates indicative of the company s cost of funds 
concentration of the company s lending activities in the real estate sector could have the effect of intensifying the impact on the company of adverse changes in the real estate market in the company s lending areas 
the ability of the company to continue to originate mortgage  construction and other loans may be impaired by adverse changes in local or regional economic conditions  adverse changes in the real estate market  increasing interest rates  or acts of nature including earthquakes or floods  which may cause uninsured damage and other loss of value to real estate that secures the company s loans 
in addition  the long term impact of the california energy crisis may cause adverse changes in the company s local economy 
due to the concentration of the company s real estate collateral in california  such events could have a significant adverse impact on the value of such collateral or the company s earnings

another  or  were held as adjustable rate mortgages 
the balance of these loans   or  consisted of multifamily loans and loans on improved single family lots 
the majority of the company s residential mortgage loans have been underwritten for the company s portfolio and do not necessarily meet standard underwriting criteria for sale in the secondary market 
approximately of the total amount outstanding had principal balances that were less than  the company s residential real estate mortgage loans predominately have loan to value ratios of or less  using current loan balances and appraised values as of the time of origination 
the company s general policy is not to exceed an loan to value ratio on residential mortgage loans without mortgage insurance

the company s primary market focus emphasizes individual borrowers and small residential and commercial projects 
the economic viability of the project and the borrower s past development record and creditworthiness are primary considerations in the loan underwriting decision 
the company had  in construction loans outstanding at december   comprising of its total loans 
these loans were principally located in northern california 
this represents a decrease of  or from during  construction loans decreased  or from in construction loans increased  or 
as of december   approximately million of these loans consisted of single family individual borrower construction loans  and the remaining loans included subdivision projects  land development projects and commercial projects

as the builder completes various line items foundation  framing  electrical  etc 
of the project  or portions of those line items  the work is reviewed by one of several independent inspectors hired by the company 
upon approval from the inspector  the company funds the draw request according to the percentage completion of the line items that have been approved 
actual funding checks must be signed by an officer of the company  and that officer must also initial the line item worksheet used to support the draw request 
in addition  company personnel or agents routinely inspect the various construction projects  all of which are located in the company s lending area 
commercial real estate mortgage and construction lending contains potential risks which are not inherent in other types of portfolio loans 
these potential risks include declines in market values of underlying real property collateral and  with respect to construction lending  delays or cost overruns  which could expose the company to loss 
in addition  risks in commercial real estate lending include declines in commercial real estate values  general economic conditions surrounding the commercial real estate properties and vacancy rates 
a decline in general economic conditions or real estate values within the company s market area could have a negative impact on the performance of the loan portfolio or value of the collateral 
because the company lends primarily within its market area  the real property collateral for its loans is similarly concentrated  rather than diversified over a broader geographic area 
the company could therefore be adversely affected by a decline in real estate values in its primary market area even if real estate values elsewhere in california remain stable or increase

commercial loan borrowers generally have deposit relationships with the company 
the commercial loans can be unsecured or secured by various assets  including equipment  receivables  deposits and other assets 
commercial loans may be secured by commercial or residential property  however  they are not classified as mortgage loans since these loans are not typically taken out for the purpose of acquiring real estate and the loans are short term 
in these cases  the mortgage collateral is often taken as additional collateral 
as of december   the size of individual commercial loans varied widely  with having principal balances less than  at december   the company had commercial borrowers whose aggregate individual liability exceeded  loan commitments 
in the normal course of business  there are various commitments outstanding to extend credit that are not reflected in the financial statements

there were  in undisbursed loan commitments and  in standby letters of credit

with respect to the company s policy of placing loans days or more past due on nonaccrual status unless the loan is well secured and in the process of collection  a loan is considered to be in the process of collection if  based on a probable specific event  it is expected that the loan will be repaid or brought current 
generally  this collection period would not exceed days 
when a loan is placed on nonaccrual status  the company s general policy is to reverse and charge against current income previously accrued but unpaid interest 
interest income on such loans is subsequently recognized only to the extent that cash is received and future collection of principal is deemed by management to be probable 
where the collectability of principal or interest on a loan is considered to be doubtful by management  it is placed on nonaccrual status prior to becoming days delinquent 
interest income is recognized on impaired loans in a manner similar to that of all loans 
it is the company s policy to place loans that are delinquent days or more as to principal or interest on nonaccrual status unless well secured and in the process of collection  and to reverse from current income accrued but uncollected interest 
cash payments subsequently received on nonaccrual loans are recognized as income only when the future collection of principal is considered by management to be probable

at december   the company did not carry any assets classified as other real estate owned 
in addition to the above mentioned assets  as of december  management of the company has identified eight lending relationships which in aggregate amount to approximately  in potential nonperforming loans  as to which it has serious doubts as to the ability of the borrowers to comply with the present repayment terms and which may become nonperforming assets  based on known information about possible credit problems of the borrower 
two of these loans are secured by real estate and the others are secured by business assets

loan losses are charged to  and recoveries are credited to  the allowance for loan losses 
the provision for loan losses is determined after considering various factors such as loan loss experience  current economic conditions  maturity of the portfolio  size of the portfolio  industry concentrations  borrower credit history  the existing allowance for loan losses  independent loan reviews  current charges and recoveries to the allowance for loan losses  and the overall quality of the portfolio  as determined by management  regulatory agencies  and independent credit review consultants retained by the company 
the adequacy of the company s allowance for loan losses is based on specific and formula allocations to the company s loan portfolio 
specific allocations of the allowance for loan losses are made to identified problem loans where management has identified significant conditions or circumstances related to a given loan  which management believes indicates the probability that a loss may occur 
the specific allocations are increased or decreased through management s reevaluation on a quarterly basis of the status of the particular problem loans 
loans which do not receive a specific allocation receive an allowance allocation based on a formula  represented by a percentage factor based on underlying collateral  type of loan  historical charge offs and general economic conditions and other qualitative factors 
it is the policy of management to make additions to the allowance for loan losses so that it remains adequate to cover probable incurred losses  and management believes that the allowance at december  was adequate 
however  the determination of the amount of the allowance is judgmental and subject to economic conditions which cannot be predicted with certainty 
accordingly  the company cannot predict whether charge offs of loans in excess of the allowance may be required in future periods 
the table below sets forth the allocation of the allowance for loan losses by loan type as of the dates specified 
the allocation of individual categories of loans includes amounts applicable to specifically identified as well as estimated losses inherent in that segment of the loan portfolio and will necessarily change whenever management determines that the risk characteristics of the loan portfolio have changed 
management believes that any breakdown or allocation of the allowance for loan losses into loan categories lends an appearance of exactness  which does not exist  in that the allowance is utilized as a single amount available for all loans 
the allocation below should not be interpreted as an indication of the specific amounts or loan categories in which future charge offs will occur

the company may also be required to reimburse a mortgage loan investor for losses incurred as a result of liquidating collateral  which had secured a mortgage loan sold by the company 
such representations and warranties include the existence of a valid appraisal  status of borrower or fraud 
the company expects that it may be required to repurchase loans in the future

the remic issued three classes of mortgage pass through mortgage certificates  a  b and c 
the sale transaction took place as a result of allied selling interest in the cofi indexed arm mortgage pool in exchange for cash of million and a class b certificate which represented the first loss position with respect to any ultimate losses realized upon the liquidation of defaulted mortgage loans in the pool 
as part of the sale transaction  allied retained the servicing of the pool 
the class a and class b certificates have sequential rights to principal payments  such that the class b certificate shall only receive principal payments after all class a certificates are retired 
the composition of the original certificate balances along with their respective december  balances is as follows original december  certificate certificate face value face value class a   class b   class c since inception the pool has realized losses of  which reduced the original face value of the class b certificate

it is the company s policy to maintain liquidity levels at the parent company which management believes to be consistent with the safety and soundness of the company as a whole 
as of december   redwood held  in deposits at nbr 
in addition  redwood has a  unsecured line of credit with a major financial institution  which bears an interest rate equal to the federal funds rate plus 
as of december   there was an outstanding balance of  under this line of credit 
payment of dividends by redwood is ultimately dependent on dividends from nbr to redwood 
federal regulatory agencies have the authority to prohibit the payment of dividends by nbr to redwood if a finding is made that such payment would constitute an unsafe or unsound practice or if nbr would be undercapitalized as a result 
if nbr is restricted from paying dividends  redwood might be unable to pay the above obligations 
no assurance can be given as to the ability of nbr to pay dividends to redwood 
at december   nbr could not pay additional dividends to redwood without prior regulatory approval 
the approval of the occ is required for the payment of dividends if the total of all dividends declared by a national bank in any calendar year would exceed the total of its net profits of that year combined with its retained net profits of the two preceding years  less any required transfers to surplus or a fund for the retirement of any preferred stock

although each entity within the consolidated group manages its own liquidity  the company s consolidated cash flows can be divided into three distinct areas  operating  investing and financing 
for the year ended december   the company received  and  in cash flows from operations and financing activities while using  in investing activities 
the principal source of asset liquidity is federal funds sold 
secondary sources of liquidity are loan repayments  investment securities available for sale  maturing investment securities held to maturity  and loans and investments that can be used as collateral for other borrowings 
at december   the company had  in federal funds sold 
total investment securities were  of which  were pledged 
liability based liquidity includes interest bearing and noninterest bearing retail deposits  which are a relatively stable source of funds  time deposits from financial institutions throughout the united states  federal funds purchased  and other short term and long term borrowings  some of which are collateralized 
as required by the federal home loan bank  nbr collateralizes its advances from the fhlb with residential mortgage loans 
management uses fhlb advances as part of its funding strategy because the rates paid for those advances are generally in line with the rates paid on time deposits 
at december   approximately  of residential mortgage loans were pledged to secure any funds the company may borrow from the fhlb in the future 
nbr s fhlb borrowing limitation at december  was  at december   nbr had outstanding fhlb advances of  at december  and nbr had paid off all fhlb advances 
management believes that at december  the company s liquidity position was adequate for the operations of redwood and its subsidiaries for the foreseeable future 
capital a strong capital base is essential to the company s continued ability to service the needs of its customers 
capital protects depositors and the deposit insurance fund from potential losses and is a source of funds for the substantial investments necessary for the company to remain competitive 
in addition  adequate capital and earnings enable the company to gain access to the capital markets to supplement its internal growth of capital 
capital is generated internally primarily through earnings retention 
the company and nbr are each required to maintain minimum capital ratios defined by various federal government regulatory agencies 
the frb and the occ have each established capital guidelines  which include minimum capital requirements 
the regulations impose two sets of standards risk based and leverage 
under the risk based capital standard  assets reported on an institution s balance sheet and certain off balance sheet items are assigned to risk categories  each of which is assigned a risk weight 
this standard characterizes an institution s capital as being tier capital defined as principally comprising shareholders equity  trust preferred securities  for up to of total tier capital  and noncumulative preferred stock and tier capital defined as principally comprising the allowance for loan losses and subordinated debt 
at december   and  the company and its subsidiaries were required to maintain a total risk based capital ratio of and a tier capital ratio of at least 
under the leverage capital standard  an institution must maintain a specified minimum ratio of tier capital to total assets  with the minimum ratio ranging from to for other than the highest rated institutions 
the minimum leverage ratio for the company and nbr is based on average assets for the quarter 
nbr maintains insurance on its customer deposits with the federal deposit insurance corporation fdic 
the fdic manages the bank insurance fund bif  which insures deposits of commercial banks such as nbr  and the savings association insurance fund saif  which insures deposits of savings associations 
fdicia mandated that the two funds maintain reserves at of their respective federally insured deposits 
the table below shows the capital ratios for the company and nbr at december  company nbr total capital to risk weighted assets tier capital to risk weighted assets leverage ratio under the most stringent capital requirement  the company has approximately  in capital above the level at which it would become under capitalized 
similarly  nbr has  in capital in excess of that level

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk as a financial institution  the company s primary component of market risk is interest rate volatility 
fluctuation in interest rates will ultimately impact both the level of income and expense recorded on a large portion of the bank s assets and liabilities and the market value of all interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  other than those which possess a short term to maturity 
since virtually all of the company s interest bearing liabilities and all of the company s interest earning assets are located at the bank  virtually all of the company s interest rate risk exposure lies at the bank level 
as a result  all significant interest rate risk management procedures are performed at the bank level 
based upon the nature of its operations  the bank is not subject to foreign currency exchange or commodity price risk 
the bank s real estate loan portfolio  concentrated primarily within northern california  is subject to risks associated with the local economy 
the company does not own any trading assets 
see asset quality in item the fundamental objective of the company s management of its assets and liabilities is to maximize the economic value of the company while maintaining adequate liquidity and an exposure to interest rate risk deemed by management to be acceptable 
management believes an acceptable degree of exposure to interest rate risk results from the management of assets and liabilities through maturities  pricing and mix to attempt to neutralize the potential impact of changes in market interest rates 
nbr s profitability is dependent to a large extent upon its net interest income  which is the difference between its interest income on interest earning assets  such as loans and securities  and its interest expense on interest bearing liabilities  such as deposits and borrowings 
nbr  like other financial institutions  is subject to interest rate risk to the degree that its interest earning assets reprice differently than its interest bearing liabilities 
nbr manages its mix of assets and liabilities with the goals of limiting its exposure to interest rate risk  ensuring adequate liquidity  and coordinating its sources and uses of funds 
nbr seeks to control its interest rate risk exposure in a manner that will allow for adequate levels of earnings and capital over a range of possible interest rate environments 
nbr has adopted formal policies and practices to monitor and manage interest rate risk exposure 
as part of this effort  nbr measures risk in three ways repricing of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  changes in net interest income for interest rate shocks up and down basis points  and changes in the market value of equity for interest rate shocks up and down basis points 
the following table sets forth  as of december   the distribution of repricing opportunities for the company s earning assets and interest bearing liabilities  the interest rate sensitivity gap  the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap  the interest rate sensitivity gap ratio ie  earning assets divided by interest bearing liabilities and the cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio 
after three after six after one within months but months but year but three within six within within after five months months one year five years years total dollars in thousands earning assets federal funds sold   investment securities       loans       total earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing transaction accounts   time deposits      other borrowings   trust preferred securities   total interest bearing liabilities       interest rate sensitivity gap       cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap      interest rate sensitivity gap ratio cumulative interest rate sensitivity gap ratio the company s gap position is substantially dependent upon the volume of loans held in the portfolio 
these loans generally have maturities greater than five years  however  these loans have a repricing frequency of at least quarterly and therefore are classified in the above table as repricing within three months 
additionally  interest bearing transaction accounts  which consist of money market and savings deposit accounts  are classified as repricing within three months 
some of these deposits may be repriced at management s option  and therefore a decision not to reprice such deposits could significantly alter the company s net interest margin 
even though the company s gap position is liability sensitive within the one year time horizon  management expects that  in a declining rate environment  the company s net interest margin would be expected to decline  and  in an increasing rate environment  the company s net interest margin would tend to increase 
the company has experienced greater mortgage lending activity through mortgage refinancing as rates declined  and may increase its net interest margins in an increasing rate environment if more traditional commercial bank lending becomes a higher percentage of the overall earning assets mix 
there can be no assurance  however  that under such circumstances the company will experience the described relationships to declining or increasing interest rates 
on a quarterly basis  nbr management prepares an analysis of interest rate risk exposure 
such analysis calculates the change in net interest income and the theoretical market value of the bank s equity given a change in general interest rates of basis points up and basis points down 
all changes are measured in dollars and are compared to projected net interest income and the current theoretical market value of the bank s equity 
this theoretical market value of the bank s equity is calculated by discounting cash flows associated with the company s assets and liabilities 
the following is a december  and summary of interest rate risk exposure as measured on a net interest income basis and a market value of equity basis  given a change in general interest rates of basis points up and basis points down 
change in annual change in change in interest rate net interest income market value of equity the company s interest rate risk exposure to a rising rate environment remained relatively stable in compared to  while exposure to a falling interest rate environment increased in compared to this increase was principally due to the current low rate environment which limits the company from lowering its funding costs at a rate consistent with potential or basis point declines in yields on earning assets 
the model utilized by management to create the report presented above makes various estimates at each level of interest rate change regarding cash flows from principal repayments on loans and mortgage backed securities and or call activity on investment securities 
in addition  repricing of these earning assets and matured liabilities can occur in one of three ways the rate of interest to be paid on an asset or liability may adjust periodically based on an index  an asset  such as a mortgage loan  may amortize  permitting reinvestment of cash flows at the then prevailing interest rates  or an asset or liability may mature  at which time the proceeds can be reinvested at the current market rate 
actual results could differ significantly from those estimates which would result in significant differences in the calculated projected change
