item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company s mission is to commercialize the use of carbon fibers as reinforcement in advanced composite materials 
the company believes it is the lowest cost producer of carbon fibers 
its sales strategy is designed to attract significant new applications for carbon fiber reinforced composites in automotive  infrastructure  construction  marine and other industries 
the company believes introduction of carbon fibers to potential end users has been generally well received and the company is participating in selected ongoing development projects in these application categories 
as part of its strategy to establish availability of carbon fibers on a scale sufficient to provide growth of large scale applications  the company completed a major carbon fiber production capacity expansion plan in fiscal the company completed construction of seven continuous carbon fiber lines  each with an annual rated capacity of one million pounds  at its abilene  texas facility five lines and zoltek rt 
facilities two lines 
in addition  the company completed construction of a secondary processing building at its abilene  texas facility to perform intermediate and secondary carbon fiber processing operations  such as chopping  milling and specialty packaging  and completed construction and partial finish out of an additional building designed to ultimately house up to more continuous carbonization lines at its abilene  texas facility 
during fiscal  the company also completed construction of an oxidization line at zoltek rt  with an annual rated capacity of two million pounds 
the company is supplying european markets with oxidized fiber used in friction and thermal applications from this line 
as the company pursues its application and market development efforts  the company has found the existing composite materials value chain relatively slow to change and is undertaking steps to accelerate the introduction and development of carbon fiber composites across a broad range of mass market applications 
the company is continuing to target emerging applications for low cost  high performance carbons in automobile manufacturing  alternate energy technologies  deep sea oil drilling applications  filament winding applications  buoyancy and fire resistant applications 
the company acquired a series of downstream businesses during fiscal  with the objective of accelerating the introduction and development of carbon fibers and carbon fiber composites in low cost  high volume applications 
the company s strategy includes providing direct input into the composites value chain by supplying composite engineering and design technology  composite processing technology and the ability to create integrated product solutions utilizing composite materials 
in october  zoltek acquired zoltek materials group  inc zoltek materials group  located in san diego  california  is a manufacturer of carbon fiber prepreg pre impregnated with resin composite materials 
in november  the company acquired substantially all of the assets of engineering technology corporation entec composite machines 
entec  located in salt lake city  utah  designs and manufactures filament winding equipment used in the production of composite parts 
also in november  the company acquired composite machines corporation cmc and ramal international  inc parent company of cmc 
cmc  located in salt lake city  utah  designed and manufactured filament winding and pultrusion equipment used in the production of composite parts 
cmc and ramal have been integrated into the entec operation 
additionally  in november  the company acquired structural polymer holdings ltd 
sp systems  which designs and manufactures composite materials used in large scale structures such as wind turbine blades and marine structures 
while this acquisition was consistent with the company s business strategy  the financial performance of this business was unsatisfactory 
therefore  in fiscal  the company formally adopted a plan to sell this subsidiary 
in november  the company sold sp systems 
in april  the company acquired a preferred membership interest in hardcore composites operations llc hardcore 
hardcore designs and manufactures composite structures for the civil infrastructure market 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company formally adopted a plan to dispose of its interests in hardcore  which was completed in march the company s consolidated financial statements for fiscal  and account for hardcore and sp systems as discontinued operations 
unless otherwise indicated  the following discussion relates to the company s continuing operations 
the company s carbon fiber manufacturing capacity continues to be underutilized 
carbon fiber sales have been depressed by excess capacity across the industry  distressed pricing across most existing markets and weakening economic conditions globally 
carbon fiber sales for fiscal were million compared to million for fiscal the company s strategy for near term sales increases was to rely primarily on what had been two fast growing commercial markets conductive plastics used in electronic products and sporting goods 
in fiscal  the growth in these two markets slowed dramatically 
in addition  sales of carbon fibers into commercial markets have been slower to develop than expected due to long lead times in product development for large scale applications 
for these reasons  the company has temporarily idled the plant in abilene  texas 
the excess capacity costs related to the carbon fiber business totaled million in in fiscal  these excess capacity costs are forecasted to be approximately million to million 
comparison of results for fiscal years ended september  and the company s sales decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal carbon fiber sales decreased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal  carbon fiber sales decreased due to excess carbon fiber capacity that resulted in distressed pricing across most existing markets and by weakened economic conditions globally 
in particular  sales declined in the compounding  automotive and buoyancy markets due to price competition  and in the sporting goods category which was impacted by lower volume in the prepreg markets  modestly offset by increased growth in the friction market 
sales of acrylic and other products produced at zoltek rt 
decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal sales in this segment declined due to the decreased demand for textile materials in response to weakened global economic conditions 
gross profit increased million to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the results for fiscal included an inventory value reduction of million  to reflect a lower of cost or market adjustment 
the inventory valuation reduction was established due to the intensified overcapacity occurring in the second quarter of fiscal  which caused distressed pricing across most existing markets for carbon fibers 
without the inventory reduction  gross profit would have been million  or of sales  in fiscal compared to million  or of sales  in fiscal gross margin from carbon fibers increased million in fiscal to million from a million loss in fiscal the margin percentage on carbon fiber increased to of sales in fiscal from of sales in fiscal  primarily due to the inventory valuation reduction 
without the inventory valuation reduction in fiscal  gross profit on carbon fibers would have been million  or of sales 
gross profit from acrylic and other products sold by zoltek rt 
was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross margin on acrylic fibers and other products decreased to of sales for fiscal compared to of sales for fiscal due primarily to price decreases and product mix 
during fiscal years  and  the company was not operating its continuous carbonization lines at the abilene  texas facility at full capacity  resulting in available unused capacity charges of approximately million  million and million  respectively 
these costs included depreciation and other overhead charges 
the company believes it is necessary to maintain available capacity to encourage development of significant new large scale applications and anticipates costs associated with the available capacity will continue into fiscal the company does  however  anticipate increases in carbon fiber sales from both the us and hungarian locations in fiscal application and development costs were million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal  representing a million increase 
this increase was due to increased costs related to the carbon fiber operations due to product and market development efforts for product trials  and for additional sales and product development personnel and travel 
targeted emerging applications include automobile manufacturing  alternate energy technologies  deep sea oil drilling  filament winding and buoyancy 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in expense was from both business segments and the corporate headquarters  due to cost cutting measures  including lower payroll and administrative costs 
interest expense was approximately million for fiscal year compared to million in fiscal the decrease in interest expense resulted from lower borrowings related to the reduced level of capital expenditures and improved working capital management 
interest income decreased to a nominal amount for fiscal from million for fiscal due to lower balances invested 
during fiscal  capital expenditures totaled million compared to million during fiscal in fiscal  the company recorded a valuation allowance against substantially all of its deferred tax assets due to the uncertainty of generating positive income in the near foreseeable future 
during fiscal  the tax laws changed allowing the company additional carryback of net operating losses to prior years 
as such  the company reported an income tax benefit of million in fiscal compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal the company received the income tax refund of million in the third quarter of fiscal the company recognizes income taxes in the united states and hungary based on the income before income taxes 
included in the provision for income taxes are gross receipts taxes charged by the hungarian local taxing authorities  as well as the statutory income taxes hungarian rate  which were million in fiscal compared to million for fiscal loss from continuing operations in fiscal included a  reversal of certain inventory reserves and a reversal of a  accrual for credits to former customers  in both instances management believes that the facts and circumstances that gave rise to the reversal of the above reserves occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal the inventory reserve release was necessary as the company sold certain products that previously were doubtful as to salability at their carrying value 
the foregoing resulted in a net loss from continuing operations of million for fiscal compared to a net loss of million for fiscal similarly  the company reported a net loss from continuing operations per share of and on a basic and diluted basis for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the weighted average common shares outstanding decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal year the net gain from discontinued operations for fiscal included a million loss from the results of operations and a million gain from the disposition of hardcore composites 
the net gain from discontinued operations included  relating to the settlement of a promissory note that was carried in the restructuring reserve  management believes that the facts and circumstances that gave rise to the above item were not present until the fourth quarter of fiscal the net loss from discontinued operations in fiscal included a million loss from the results of operations of hardcore composites and a million loss from the disposition of sp systems 
the foregoing resulted in a net gain from discontinued operations of million in fiscal  or per share on a basic and diluted basis  and a net loss of million in fiscal  or per share on a basic and diluted basis 
the net loss for fiscal was million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis compared to a net loss of million  or per share in fiscal comparison of results for fiscal years ended september  and the company s sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal carbon fiber sales decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal during fiscal  the decrease in carbon fiber sales volumes was primarily the result of distressed pricing due to significant overcapacity in the industry 
sales of acrylic and other products produced at zoltek rt 
were comparable year over year  million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross profit decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal gross profit from carbon fibers decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal an inventory valuation reduction of million recorded in fiscal  to reflect a lower of cost or market adjustment  was the primary component of the gross profit reduction 
the inventory valuation reduction was established due to the intensified overcapacity occurring in the year  which caused distressed pricing across most existing markets for carbon fibers 
the margin percentage on carbon fiber decreased to of sales in fiscal from in fiscal  primarily due to the inventory valuation reduction 
without the inventory reduction  gross profit would have been million  a million reduction year over year 
gross profit from acrylic and other products sold by zoltek rt  was million in fiscal compared to million in fiscal gross margin on acrylic fibers and other products decreased to of sales for fiscal from of sales for fiscal due to increases in raw material costs that could not be passed along to customers 
during fiscal years and  the company was not operating its new continuous carbonization lines at full capacity  resulting in available unused capacity charges of approximately and million  respectively 
application and development costs in fiscal were million versus million in fiscal this increase was due to product and market development efforts for product trials  additional sales product development personnel and travel  primarily in carbon fibers 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  primarily due to salaries and other personnel related costs 
interest expense was approximately million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal the increase in interest expense resulted from borrowings related to the use of funds for working capital and capital expenditures 
interest income was million for fiscal compared to million in fiscal interest income increased due to higher balances invested  including notes from sale of businesses 
during fiscal  capital expenditures totaled million 
during fiscal  the company reported an income tax benefit of million compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal the company recorded a valuation allowance against the deferred income tax asset in fiscal that caused the company to recognize a lower income tax benefit in fiscal even though the company had significantly greater net losses than in the prior year 
the company recognizes income taxes in both the united states and hungary based on the income before income taxes 
included in the provision for income taxes are gross receipts taxes charged by the hungarian local taxing authorities  which were years and  as well as the statutory income taxes 
the statutory income tax rate for the zoltek rt 
operation in hungary is 
the foregoing resulted in a net loss from continuing operations of million for fiscal compared to a net loss of million for fiscal similarly  the company reported net loss from continuing operations per share of and on a basic and diluted basis for fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the weighted average common shares outstanding decreased to million for fiscal compared to million for fiscal year due to the repurchase of approximately million common shares as partial consideration for the sale of sp systems in november in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company formally adopted a plan to dispose of its interest in hardcore composites  llc  which it acquired in april the net loss from discontinued operations for fiscal included a million loss from the results of operations of hardcore composites  a million impairment charge to write off the fixed assets and intangibles of hardcore  and a million charge for the discontinued operations of sp systems occurring in fiscal the foregoing resulted in a net loss from discontinued operations of million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis in fiscal  and million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis  in fiscal the net loss for fiscal was million  or per share on a basic and diluted basis  compared to a net loss of million  or per share in fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s primary sources of liquidity historically have been cash flow from operating activities and borrowings under credit facilities  supplemented with the net proceeds from three previous equity offerings  and long term debt financing utilizing the equity in the company s real estate properties 
during much of fiscal and  the carbon fiber market experienced excess supply resulting from capacity increases by several other carbon fiber manufacturers 
as a result  the company experienced substantial reductions in selling prices and related gross profit across most existing markets partially offset by a favorable product mix in fiscal 
the company expects market conditions similar to fiscal to continue until the market demand consumes the excess capacity 
however  the company plans to continue to reduce its carbon fiber inventory  rationalize its work force to reflect current and near term demand and reduce operating expenses 
management s objective is to operate the continuing business on a cash flow neutral basis by the end of fiscal on may   the company entered into a two year credit facility with southwest bank of st 
louis in the amount of million 
the credit facility is structured as a term loan in the amount of million  and a revolving credit loan in the amount of million 
the company used the proceeds of the new facility to repay existing borrowing of million  plus accrued interest  and terminated the old credit facility 
borrowings under the new facility are based on a formula of eligible accounts receivable and inventory of the company s us based subsidiaries 
the outstanding loans under the agreement bear interest at the prime interest rate 
the loan agreement contains financial covenants related to borrowings  working capital  debt coverage  current ratio  inventory turn ratio  and capital expenditures 
the company issued warrants to the bank to purchase  shares of common stock of the company at an exercise price of per share  exercisable at any time during a five year period from the date of the loan 
in december  the company amended its credit agreement with southwest bank see note to waive the debt coverage ratio covenant for the first two quarters of fiscal  and modify the current ratio  the inventory turn ratio and the debt coverage ratio covenants for quarters subsequent to the second quarter of fiscal in june   the company amended the credit agreement with southwest bank to waive the debt coverage ratio and the inventory turn ratio covenants for the remainder of fiscal  modify the current ratio covenant for the third and fourth quarters of fiscal  and lower the maximum advance on inventory covenant for quarters subsequent to the third quarter of fiscal in consideration for these concessions by southwest bank  the company paid fees of  and the interest rate was adjusted to the prime rate plus per annum 
as a result of these waivers and modifications  at september   the company was in compliance with all financial covenants requirements included in the credit agreement as amended 
the company was not in compliance with a financial covenant under its credit agreement with southwest bank as of december  additionally  the company currently anticipates that as of march  it will not be in compliance with a certain financial covenant of the current credit agreement 
as a result  under the terms of the credit agreement  southwest bank has the ability to make all outstanding borrowings under the credit agreement due and immediately payable 
the credit agreement with southwest bank expires on may  and  assuming southwest bank does not request repayment of the debt by the company prior to may  as a result of the financial covenant non compliance  any outstanding borrowings will be due and immediately payable on that date 
total borrowings under the credit agreement were million at september the company currently does not have the funds to repay the borrowings under the credit agreement at any date before or on may  management is currently in the process of executing a refinancing plan 
the company has received a commitment letter from southwest bank with respect to a proposed amendment to the existing credit facility that  as amended  would provide for million million revolving debt that would mature in one year from closing and million term debt that would mature two years from closing  with modifications of the interest rate expected to be the prime interest rate plus  financial covenants and additional collateral 
in addition  the company anticipates that it will enter into an agreement with a group of approximately investors  including messrs 
bealke  dill  mcdonnell and rumy  under which the investors would invest an aggregate of million in the company s convertible subordinated debentures 
the debentures would mature five years after issuance  bear interest at per annum and would be convertible into  shares of common stock of the company at a conversion price of per share 
the agreement also would provide for the company to issue five year warrants to purchase  shares of the company s common stock at an exercise price of per share 
proceeds from the issuance of these convertible subordinated debentures will be used to reduce the current credit facility borrowings by million and for working capital 
completion of this amendment to the credit agreement is subject to  among other things  the completion of the sale of the company s convertible subordinated debentures 
completion of this refinancing plan by management is critical not only to meet its obligations under the southwest bank credit agreement but also to provide the company with adequate liquidity to finance its operations and meet other obligations in fiscal  and continue to execute the company s long term business strategy 
management expects to be able to complete the credit facility amendment and issuance of the convertible subordinated debentures during the company s fiscal second quarter ending march  however  if management is unsuccessful in completing a refinancing plan that includes repaying borrowings under the southwest bank credit agreement  or obtaining modifications to the credit agreement that would extend the expiration date  waive the existing financial covenant non compliance and include achievable prospective financial covenant requirements  the company would be forced to seek other sources of financing or creditor relief that would most likely be on terms unfavorable to the company 
on may   the company s hungarian subsidiary entered into an expanded credit facility  to million from million  with raiffeisen bank rt 
the facility consists of a million bank guarantee and factoring facility and a working capital facility  both expiring in november and a million capital investment facility that expires in the factoring facility and the working capital facility are one year agreements renewable each year 
borrowings against the raiffeisen credit facility cannot be used in zoltek s us operations 
the company believes its financial position has been improved as a result of recent operating cost reductions including the rationalization of its work force and the reduction of operating expenses  and the disposal of sp systems and hardcore composites 
management believes that the company s financial resources remain adequate to support the execution of its strategic plans 
however  failure to comply with its obligations under its existing credit facilities  or obtain new financing when its existing us bank credit facility matures  manage costs  and increase carbon fiber sales on a timely basis would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations and financial condition 
management will seek to fund its continuing operations from borrowings including seeking additional sources of liquidity and to continue to closely manage the company s working capital 
the company s objective is to operate the continuing business on a cash neutral basis by the end of fiscal the company does not believe that any impairment exists relative to its capital investments as it is still forecasting an improvement in the long term carbon fibers markets within a reasonable forecasting range of one to two years 
the company reported working capital excluding discontinued operations of million at september  compared to working capital of million at september  the decrease in working capital from september  to september  was primarily due to reclassifying its debt with southwest bank to current from long term  as the debt to southwest bank matures in may the company s continuing operations used million of cash during fiscal versus million in fiscal  million of the million improvement was due to receipt of the federal tax refund 
the company has taken steps to rationalize its work force to reflect current and near term demand  to significantly reduce other operating expenses and to decrease carbon fiber inventories via an aggressive sales program 
at september   the company reported cash and cash equivalents of million and had available million of unused borrowings under its credit facilities million from southwest bank and million from raiffeisen bank rt 
for its hungarian subsidiary 
as of december   the company continues to have million of unused borrowings under its credit facilities million from southwest bank and million from raiffeisen bank rt current maturities of long term debt at september  included million of the us credit facility coming due in may  plus approximately million related to various mortgages 
historically  cash used in investing activities has been expended for equipment additions and to support research and development of carbon fibers applications and the expansion of the company s carbon fibers production capacity 
in fiscal  the company made capital expenditures of million for various projects compared to million during fiscal of these expenditures in fiscal  approximately million was used for oxidation lines and secondary processing equipment for carbon fibers and million was used at zoltek rt 
for modernization and modifications to produce acrylic fiber and other industrial products 
carbon fiber operations reported capital expenditures of approximately million for equipment additions and modifications 
these expenditures were financed principally with cash from the sale of temporary investments and from borrowings 
in fiscal  the company expects purchases of property  plant and equipment to be less than million  unless near term demand increases significantly 
application and development costs are projected to be million in fiscal in fiscal  the company placed million of assets in service that were previously classified as construction in progress 
these assets are primarily located at the abilene  texas facility and consisted of million of buildings and million of machinery and equipment 
the company began recording depreciation on these assets from the date they were placed in service 
in the third quarter of fiscal  the company elected to temporarily idle the continuous carbonization lines at the abilene facility 
these carbonization lines had a carrying value of million at september  management intends to return the lines to partial production in late fiscal and full production as market demand for carbon fiber products increases 
in light of the expected resumption of manufacturing at this time  the company does not believe that any impairment exists with respect to the carrying value of the currently idled assets at the abilene facility based on an analysis of expected future net cash flow generated from this facility over the expected remaining useful life 
as part of the company s strategic plan for commercializing carbon fibers and carbon fiber composites  the company acquired zoltek materials group and entec composite machines in november for an aggregate purchase price of million in cash 
the company also assumed certain liabilities at acquisition and provided working capital and credit facilities for the acquired companies 
in november  the company acquired all of the outstanding stock of sp systems for approximately million in cash and million shares of the company s common stock 
the company also borrowed million to refinance certain existing bank debt of sp systems and fund working capital requirements 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company formally adopted a plan to sell sp systems  which was completed in november the company entered into a six year credit facility with a commercial bank in an original aggregate amount of million to finance the sp systems acquisition and refinance other indebtedness 
the company amended and restated the credit agreement on may  to reduce the amount of borrowings available to million and to modify certain covenants 
the facility  as amended  contained financial covenants related to borrowings  future acquisitions  working capital  net worth  cash flow  and fixed charge coverage 
the company reduced the borrowings under the credit facility by million in november from the proceeds of the sale of sp systems 
in april  the company acquired a membership interest in hardcore for million cash and guaranteed a note payable of million 
the company also provided additional funding for working capital 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company formally adopted a plan to dispose of hardcore  and it completed the sale in march see note of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies outlined below are accounting policies that zoltek believes are key to a full understanding of the company s operations and financial results 
all of the company s accounting policies are in compliance with us generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
revenue recognition the company recognizes sales on the date title to the sold product transfers to the customer  which generally approximates the shipping date 
historically  the company has experienced very low levels of product returns due to damaged goods or products that do not meet customer specifications 
additionally  the company generally does not offer any volume or other incentives to entice customer sales 
inventories the company evaluates its ending inventories for estimated excess quantities and obsolescence 
this evaluation includes analyses of sales levels by product and projections of future demand within specific time horizons 
inventories in excess of future demand  if any  are reserved 
remaining inventory balances are adjusted to approximate the lower of cost on a first in  first out basis or market value 
cost includes material  labor and overhead 
if future demand or market conditions are less favorable than the company s projections  additional inventory write downs may be required and would be reflected in cost of sales on the company s statement of operations in the period in which the revision is made 
in recent years  carbon fiber sales have been depressed by excess capacity across the industry  distressed pricing across most existing markets and weakening economic conditions globally 
these factors combined with the high level of inventories maintained by the company have resulted in the company reducing the cost of certain carbon fiber inventories to their lower estimated market values 
if these industry conditions do not improve in a reasonable period of time  or further deteriorate  it is possible that the market value of certain of the company s carbon fiber inventories may further decrease resulting in additional charges to cost of sales 
application and development expenses the company is actively pursuing the development of a number of applications for the use of its carbon fiber and related products 
the company is currently party to several developmental agreements with various prospective users of these products for the purpose of accelerating the development of various carbon fiber applications 
additionally  the company is executing several internal developmental strategies to further the use of carbon fiber and consumer and industrial products made from carbon fiber 
as a result  the company incurs certain costs for research  development and engineering of products and manufacturing processes 
these costs are expensed as incurred and totaled approximately million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
application and development expenses are presented as an operating item on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
given the company s position and strategy within the carbon fiber industry  it is expected that similar or greater levels of application and development expenses will be incurred in future years 
unused capacity costs the company is currently not operating its continuous carbonization lines located at the abilene  texas facility at full capacity 
as a result  the company has elected to categorize certain costs related to these idle assets as unused capacity costs 
such costs for the years ended september   and totaled million  million and million  respectively  and include depreciation and other overhead expenses associated with unused capacity 
the unused capacity costs are presented as an operating item on the company s consolidated statement of operations 
as discussed above  management intends to return the abilene  texas facility to service in fiscal however  until the facility is operating at certain production levels  these unused capacity costs will continue to be incurred 
valuation of long lived assets long lived assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
if the sum of the expected future undiscounted cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  a loss is recognized for the difference between the fair value and the carrying value of the asset 
in determining expected future undiscounted cash flows attributable to a long lived asset or a group of long lived assets  the company must make certain judgments and estimations including the expected market conditions and demand for products produced by the assets  expected product pricing assumptions  and assumptions related to the expected costs to operate the assets 
these judgments and assumptions are particularly challenging as they relate to the company s long lived assets due to the developmental stage and current market conditions of the carbon fiber industry 
it is possible that actual future cash flows related to the company s long lived assets may materially differ from the company s determination of expected future undiscounted cash flows 
additionally  if the company s expected future undiscounted cash flows were less than the carrying amount of the asset being analyzed  it would be necessary for the company to make significant judgments regarding the fair value of the asset due to the specialized nature of much of the company s carbon fiber production equipment in order to determine the amount of the impairment charge 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to changes in interest rates primarily as a result of borrowing activities under its credit facility 
the nature and amount of the company s debt may vary as a result of future business requirements  market conditions and other factors 
the extent of the company s interest rate risk is not quantifiable or predictable because of the variability of future interest rates and business financing requirements  but the company does not believe such risk is material 
however  a one percent increase in the weighted average interest rate at september  of the company s debt for fiscal compared to fiscal would result in a million increase in interest expense based on debt levels at september  excluding discontinued operations 
see liquidity and capital resources included under item above 
the company views as long term its investment in zoltek rt  which has a functional currency other than the us dollar 
as a result  the company does not hedge this net investment 
in terms of foreign currency translation risk  the company is exposed to zoltek rt 
s functional currency which is the hungarian forint 
the company s net foreign currency investment in zoltek rt 
translated into us dollars using period end exchange rates was million and million at september  and september   respectively 
the potential loss in value of the company s net foreign currency investment in zoltek rt 
resulting from a hypothetical adverse change in quoted foreign currency exchange rate of the hungarian forint at september  and september  amounted to million and million  respectively 
in addition  zoltek rt 
routinely sells its products to customers located primarily throughout europe in sales transactions that are denominated in foreign currencies other than the hungarian forint 
as a result  zoltek rt 
is exposed to foreign currency risks related to these transactions 
the company does not currently employ a foreign currency hedging strategy related to the sales of zoltek rt 
and does not believe these risks will have a material adverse impact on the company s results of operations or financial position
