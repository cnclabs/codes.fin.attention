critical accounting policies the securities and exchange commission has issued disclosure guidance for critical accounting policies 
the sec defines critical accounting policies as those that require application of management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain and may change in subsequent periods 
management is required to make certain estimates and assumptions during the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
these estimates and assumptions impact the reported amount of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the consolidated financial statements 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
the significant accounting policies are described in note of the notes to consolidated financial statements included in the company s annual report on form k 
not all of these significant accounting policies require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments or estimates 
however  management considers the following policies to be critical within the sec definition 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost first in  first out or average or market value and have been reduced by an allowance for excess and obsolete inventories 
the estimate is based on managements review of inventories on hand compared to estimated future usage and sales 
cost includes material  labor and manufacturing overhead 
long lived assets long lived assets  such as property  plant  and equipment  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its estimated future cash flows  an impairment charge is recognized by the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset  which is generally based on discounted cash flows 
goodwill  which is not subject to amortization is tested annually for impairment  and more frequently if events and circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired 
an impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the company exceeds its fair value 
deferred income taxes a portion of the deferred tax assets  which have been recorded by the company  represent net operating loss carry forwards 
a valuation allowance has been recorded for certain capital losses and other deferred tax assets 
in assessing the realizability of deferred tax assets  management considers whether it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets is dependent upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
management considers the scheduled reversal of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  and tax planning strategies in making this assessment 
accounts receivable the company estimates an allowance for doubtful accounts after considering the collectibility of balances due  the credit worthiness of the customer and its current level of business with the customer 
actual results could differ from these estimates 
recently issued accounting standards not yet adopted in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas no 

sfas no 
requires the company to record the fair value of an asset retirement obligation as a liability in the period in which it incurs a legal obligation associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets that result from the acquisition  construction  development and or normal use of the assets 
the company also records a corresponding asset  which is depreciated over the life of the asset 
subsequent to the initial measurement of the asset retirement obligation  the obligation will be adjusted at the end of each period to reflect the passage of time and changes in the estimated future cash flows underlying the obligation 
the company is required to adopt sfas no 
on january  the adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
statement no 
is different from eitf issue no 
in that statement no 
requires that a liability be recognized for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity only when the liability is incurred  that is when it meets the definition of a liability in the fasb s conceptual framework 
statement no 
also establishes fair value as the objective for initial measurement of liabilities related to exit or disposal activities 
in contrast  under eitf issue  a company recognized a liability for an exit cost when it committed to an exit plan 
statement no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the adoption of statement no 
can be expected to impact the timing of liability recognition associated with any future exit activities 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk in the normal course of business  the company is exposed to fluctuations in interest rates as it seeks debt financing to make capital expenditures  potential acquisitions  and invest in cash equivalents and marketable debt securities 
cash equivalents and other marketable investments are carried at fair value on the consolidated balance sheets 
at times  management might employ specific strategies  such as the use of derivative instruments or hedging to manage foreign currency or other exposures 
further  the company does not expect its market risk exposures to change in the near term 
at december   the outstanding borrowings of the company consisted primarily of fixed rate long term debt  which had a carrying value of  and a fair value of approximately  assuming other factors are held constant  interest rate changes generally affect the fair value of fixed rate debt  but do not impact the carrying value  earnings or cash flows 
accordingly  assuming a hypothetical increase of in interest rates and all other variables remaining constant  interest expense would not change  however  the fair market value of the fixed rate long term debt would decrease by approximately
