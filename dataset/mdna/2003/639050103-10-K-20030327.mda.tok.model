you are cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance 
the forward looking statements are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties that could cause our future business  financial condition  or results of operations to differ materially from our historical results or currently anticipated results 
investors should carefully review the information contained under the caption risk factors  beginning on page of this management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  and elsewhere in or incorporated by reference into this report 
the following discussion and analysis also should be read in conjunction with selected consolidated financial data and our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
all forward looking statements included in this document are based on information available to us on the date hereof  and we assume no obligation to update any such forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements are made in reliance upon the safe harbor provision of the private securities litigation reform act of overview we develop  manufacture and market screening products for the detection  monitoring  and treatment of common medical disorders in infants 
currently  we sell our algo screening products for hearing screening  our co stat products for the analysis of hemolysis and our neoblue phototherapy device for the treatment of jaundice 
our revenues are from sales of equipment and disposable supplies 
we currently derive substantially all of our revenues from sales of a limited number of products 
nearly all of our revenues were from sales of our algo screening products in  and although we commercially launched our co stat analyzer product in january and our neoblue phototherapy device in october of  we expect that a substantial majority of our revenues will continue to be generated from sales of our algo screening products for at least the next two years 
historically we have sold our products directly through our sales force in the united states and indirectly through distributors internationally 
domestic sales were of our revenues during and  and of our revenues during we plan to expand our international operations significantly because we believe 
table of contents international markets represent a significant growth opportunity 
we acquired the distribution operations of our united kingdom distributor in january and also began distribution operations in japan in july  when we acquired the business operations of our japanese distributor 
the results of our operations in the united kingdom and japan were immaterial and have been included in our consolidated results from those dates 
we anticipate that international revenues will increase as a percent of revenues in the future 
if international sales increase  we may not experience corresponding growth in operating income due to the higher cost of selling outside of the united states 
historically  our international sales have been indirect and through distributors and have been characterized by lower gross margins due to the discount the distributors receive from our list prices 
our net income or loss can be markedly impacted by the decisions of management regarding the level of resources applied to our business 
management  and our board of directors  makes these decisions on the basis of sales forecasts  expected customer orders  economic conditions and other factors 
these costs are primarily personnel and facilities costs that are relatively fixed in the short term and directly impact net income 
in and the first half of  we increased our level of spending on the marketing and sales of our co stat products 
we spent a considerable amount of time and resources on education of governments  hospitals and clinicians regarding the benefit of our co stat products 
despite these expenditures  we have not achieved the level of sales of our co stat products that we had anticipated 
in the third quarter of  we began to reduce marketing and sales expenses associated with our co stat products  in order to adjust our expenses to more accurately reflect our expectations regarding near term revenues 
in the fourth quarter of  we also recorded a write down of excess parts and materials we had purchased for our co stat products 
we continue to believe that our co stat technology represents a platform technology and are moving forward with clinical research for additional applications  most notably its use for the detection of medical conditions leading to pre term delivery 
while we intend to continue to support the user base now in place  we are currently evaluating the viability of marketing our co stat products in the newborn jaundice market 
we do not expect to realize material revenue from our co stat product in  if ever 
we introduced our neoblue phototherapy device in october at the american academy of pediatrics national conference and exhibition in boston  massachusetts 
our neoblue product enhances the line of products and services that we provide to assist clinicians with the management of newborn jaundice 
our current sales and marketing force incorporates our neoblue device as part of our jaundice management product offering 
because we have not previously marketed the neoblue phototherapy device or devices for the treatment of newborn jaundice  we cannot be certain that it will be well received by our clinician customers 
we do not expect to recognize material revenue from our neoblue phototherapy device in  if ever 
during the third quarter of  we implemented an operating cost reduction plan that resulted in a reduction of employees and the accrual of associated employee termination related benefits 
the employee reductions were from production  marketing and sales  research and development  and administrative 
our net loss available to common stockholders includes accretion charges to increase the carrying amount of our redeemable convertible preferred stock to the amount we would have been required to pay if the preferred stock had been redeemed prior to the date of our initial public offering in july our redeemable convertible preferred stock converted to common stock on a one for one basis upon the closing of our initial public offering in july and accretion ceased as of that time 
we did not pay accrued dividends on the redeemable convertible preferred stock when it converted  and accrued but unpaid dividends became additional paid in capital 
as of december   we had total federal and state net operating loss carry forwards of approximately million and million  respectively  available to reduce future taxable income 
if not utilized to offset taxable income in future periods  these net operating loss carry forwards will expire in various amounts beginning in and continuing through if we continue to have net losses  we may not be able to utilize some or all of our net operating loss carry forwards before they expire 
in addition united states income tax law 
table of contents imposes limitations on the amount of net operating loss carry forwards we can use in any given year and on the ability to use net operating loss carry forwards if we experience a more than change in ownership during any three year period 
application of critical accounting policies we prepare our financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap 
in so doing  we must often make estimates and use assumptions that can be subjective  and consequently our actual results could differ from those estimates 
for any given individual estimate or assumption we make  there may also be other estimates or assumptions that are reasonable 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies require the use of significant estimates  assumptions  and judgments 
the use of different estimates  assumptions  and judgments could have a material affect on the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and related disclosures at the date of the financial statements and during the reporting period 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue  net of discounts  from product sales  including sales to distributors  when a purchase order has been received  when title transfers generally upon shipment  when the selling price is fixed or determinable  and when collection of the resulting receivable is probable 
we generally do not provide rights of return on our products 
revenue from extended warranty contracts is recognized ratably over the warranty period 
advance payments from customers are recorded as deferred revenue until shipment of the related product 
we have established an allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
we must exercise judgment when assessing the sufficiency of our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable 
our estimates are based on our historical collection experience within the markets in which we operate as well as assessment of our average accounts receivable aging days and any other specific information of which we may be aware  such as bankruptcy filings or liquidity problems of our customers 
any future determination that our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable is understated could result in increased operating expense and reduce our results of operations 
at december  our deferred revenues under extended warranty contracts were approximately  advance payments from customers were not material at december  our allowance for estimated uncollectible accounts receivable was  at december  inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market value as a medical device manufacturer  we may be exposed to a number of factors that could result in portions of our inventory becoming either obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage 
these factors include  but are not limited to  technological changes in our markets  competitive pressures in products and prices  and our own introduction of new product lines 
we regularly evaluate our ability to realize the value of our inventory based on a combination of factors  including historical usage rates  forecasted sales  product life cycles  and market acceptance of new products 
when we identify inventory that is obsolete or in excess of anticipated usage we write it down to realizable salvage value 
the estimates we use in projecting future product demand may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our inventory is overvalued could result in increases to our cost of sales and decreases to our operating margins and results of operations 

table of contents carrying value of intangible assets under generally accepted accounting principles we are required to write down intangible assets if such assets are determined to be impaired 
under current accounting standards  an impairment of an intangible is considered to have occurred when the estimated undiscounted future cash flows related to the asset are less than the carrying value of the asset 
estimates of future cash flows involve consideration of many factors including the marketability of new products  product acceptance and lifecycle  competition  and operating margins 
we amortize intangible assets with finite lives over their useful lives  any future changes that would limit their useful lives could result in additional charges to our research and development costs and decrease our operating results 
we carry intangibles with indefinite lives at original cost  any future determination that these assets are carried at greater than their expected future undiscounted cash flows could result in additional charges to our research and development costs and decrease our operating results 
at december  we have intangible assets with a carrying value of approximately million 
liability for product warranties our products are covered by standard one year product warranty plans 
a liability has been established for the expected cost of servicing our products during these warranty periods 
we base the liability in part upon our historical experience  however  estimates of the costs to honor our warranties are often difficult to determine due to uncertainty surrounding the extent to which new products will require servicing and the costs that will be incurred to service those products 
the estimates we use in projecting future product warranty costs may prove to be incorrect 
any future determination that our product warranty reserves are understated could result in increases to our cost of sales and decreases to our operating margins and results of operations 
at december  our reserve for product warranties is approximately valuation allowance for deferred tax assets we record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets  which result primarily from net operating loss and credit carryforwards that expire over time  and timing differences between book and tax results 
in evaluating whether we would more likely than not recover these deferred tax assets  we have not assumed any future taxable income in the tax jurisdictions in which we operate 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance  or increase this allowance in a period  we include an offsetting expense within the tax provision in the consolidated statement of operations 
future income generation in these tax jurisdictions could lead to the reversal of these valuation allowances and additional income recognition 
at december   our net deferred tax assets were zero  net of an million valuation allowance 

table of contents results of operations the following table sets forth for the periods indicated selected consolidated statement of operations data as a percentage of total revenues 
our historical operating results are not necessarily indicative of the results for any future period 
certain amounts in the and financial statements have been reclassified to conform to the current year presentation

table of contents our cost of revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in the cost of revenues was primarily due to the write down of  of excess inventory related to the co stat analyzer  higher costs associated with producing the new algo pak supply  and increases in manufacturing costs 
cost of revenues also includes an adjustment of  to decrease the reserve for expected warranty costs to reflect recent improved warranty cost experience

our research and development expenses increased  or  to million in from million in this increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the development of new products based on technology acquired from pemstar pacific consultants 
our general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the dollar increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to increased legal  accounting and other consulting fees  increases in insurance costs  and increases in reserves for estimated local tax expense 
many of the increased costs were costs associated with being a public company for the entire year 
in september  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately  relating to an operating cost reduction plan which resulted in a reduction of employees and the accrual of associated employee termination related benefits 
the employee reductions were from production  marketing and sales  research and development  and administrative 
accordingly  the related charges were recorded in cost of revenues  marketing and selling  research and development  and general and administrative expenses 
as of december   we had paid approximately  of costs related to the restructuring 
we recorded aggregate amortization of  of deferred stock compensation in  of which  was included in cost of revenues  and million of deferred stock compensation in  of which  was included in cost of revenues 
our other income expense  net increased  or  to million in from  in the increase was primarily due to foreign currency gains as well as interest earned on greater average cash and short term investment balances in as a result of our initial public offering 
comparison of and our revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was primarily attributable to increased quantities of disposable supplies sold 
revenues from disposable supplies increased million  or  to million in from million in as a percent of revenues  revenues from sales of disposables increased to in from in no end customer accounted for more than of our revenues in either or sales to our japanese distributor  nippon eurotec  accounted for of our revenues in 
table of contents revenues from sales outside the united states increased million  or  to million in from million in this increase was due primarily to higher quantities of our products sold in japan  the united kingdom and other countries as well as increases in realized selling prices associated with our subsidiaries now acting as distributors in those countries 
japanese sales were million in and million in our cost of revenues increased million  or  to million in from million in the increase in the cost of revenues in dollars was primarily due to the increased volume of screening equipment and disposable supplies sold during and increases in manufacturing costs

we experienced a reduction in the effective selling price of our algo screening equipment due to an increase in the number of units sold in connection with trade ins 
trade ins reduced margins by up to  per unit  and are typically more frequent at the commencement of a new model cycle 
our marketing and selling expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the dollar increase in marketing and selling expenses was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional marketing and selling personnel  increases in commissions due to increased sales and the expansion of our sales efforts  particularly in connection with an increase in our domestic field staff and the acquisition of our distributors in japan and the united kingdom during we expect that marketing and selling expenses will continue to increase in the future 
our research and development expenses increased  or  to million in from million in this increase in research and development expenses was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional engineers and consultants 
our general and administrative expenses increased million  or  to million in from million in the dollar increase in general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to the hiring of additional personnel  as well as increased legal  accounting and other consulting fees and insurance costs 
payroll  consulting and manufacturing costs in increased over  a rate greater than our increase in revenue 
many of the increased costs were costs associated with being a public company 
we recorded aggregate amortization of  of deferred stock compensation in  of which  was included in cost of revenues and million of deferred stock compensation in  of which  was included in cost of revenues 
our other income expense  net increased  to  in from  in the increase was primarily due to higher interest earned on increased average cash and short term investment balances in as a result of our initial public offering 
liquidity and capital resources as of december   we had cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  stockholders equity of million and working capital of million 
we completed an initial public offering of  shares of our common stock at per share in july and raised million after underwriting discounts and commissions  but before expenses payable by us 
in august  our managing 
table of contents underwriters exercised their right to purchase an additional  shares of our common stock at per share for net proceeds of million after underwriting discounts and commissions but before any expenses payable by us 
net cash used in operating activities of million for compared to net cash used in operating activities of million for  and net cash provided by operating activities of  for cash used in operating activities for resulted primarily from the net loss during the period and an increase in inventories  accounts receivable  and prepaid expenses  and a decrease in accrued expenses 
these factors were partially offset in part by an increase in accounts payable and non cash items such as depreciation and amortization of intangibles and deferred compensation 
the increase in inventories was due primarily to having inventory at our japanese and uk subsidiaries at december   whereas in these inventories were owned by our independent distributors 
a portion of the increase in inventory was also additional domestic inventory associated with the algo screener product line 
net cash used in operating activities for resulted primarily from the net loss during the period and an increase in inventories and a decrease in accrued liabilities  offset in part by non cash items such as deferred stock compensation and depreciation and amortization 
increases in inventories and accounts receivable were primarily associated with the acquisition and expansion of our wholly owned foreign operations in the united kingdom and japan 
net cash provided by operating activities for resulted primarily from non cash items such as deferred stock compensation and depreciation and amortization  plus an increase in accrued liabilities  reduced by an increase in accounts receivable and inventories 
net cash used in investing activities was million for  million for  and  for net cash used in investing activities during was primarily the result of acquisition of property and equipment  including a major upgrade to the company s existing enterprise resource planning system  as well as increases in deposits and other assets  and purchases of short term investments  net of sale proceeds 
net cash used in investing activities during was primarily for investment of cash received as a result of our initial public offering and for the purchase of new computers  equipment and furniture as we expanded operations 
net cash used in investing activities for was primarily for the purchase of new computers  equipment and furniture as we expanded operations 
because of our investment policy  the types of investments we may make are limited 
primarily all of our short term investments are available for sale securities with maturities of less than a year  and fluctuations between cash equivalents and short term investments are often attributable to investment decisions 
we had no material capital expenditure commitments as of december  we have a  interest bearing certificate of deposit that is classified as a held to maturity investment 
this investment matures in april and was assigned to a bank in february to guarantee a loan on a primary residence of an officer totaling  plus accrued interest 
the guarantee is collateralized by  shares of our stock held by the officer 
net cash provided by financing activities of  for was primarily from the proceeds of purchases of stock by employees pursuant to our stock option and purchase plans 
net cash provided by financing activities of million for resulted primarily from the net proceeds received from our initial public offering offset by deferred offering costs 
net cash used in financing activities of million for resulted primarily from deferred offering costs and repayment of borrowings 
our future liquidity and capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the amount and timing of revenues  the extent to which our existing and new products gain market acceptance  the extent to which we make acquisitions  the cost and timing of product development efforts and the success of these development efforts  the cost and timing of marketing and selling activities  and available borrowings under line of credit arrangements and the availability of other means of financing 

table of contents we have entered into noncancelable operating leases for its facilities located in the united states through december noncancelable operating leases for facilities located in the united kingdom expire in  and in japan in minimum lease payments under noncancelable operating leases as of december  are as follows in thousands operating leases year ending december  total minimum lease payments we had various firm purchase commitments for inventory totaling approximately  at december  in march  we entered into an agreement to acquire certain intellectual property and technology patents of a private company for million subject to certain conditions to closing and other obligations of the seller 
we financed the acquisition with short term notes payable that do not bear interest 
payments of  each were made in april and july  and the notes have been paid in full 
we also entered into a product development agreement with respect to the acquired rights  which we expect will involve additional payments in the aggregate amount of  between april  and september  as of december   we have paid  of the costs associated with the product development agreement 
we believe that our current cash and cash equivalent balances and any cash generated from operations and from current or future debt financing will be sufficient to meet our operating and capital requirements for at least the next months 
however  it is possible that we may require additional financing within this period 
we intend to continue to invest in the development of new products  and enhancements to our existing products  and in both existing and new product distribution domestically and overseas 
the factors described above will affect our future capital requirements and the adequacy of our available funds 
in addition  even if our current funds are sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs during the next months  we may need to raise additional funds beyond this time  particularly if we invest significant amounts in the acquisition of businesses and products 
we may be required to raise those funds through public or private financings  strategic relationships or other arrangements 
any additional equity financing may be dilutive to stockholders  and debt financing  if available  may involve restrictive covenants 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we develop products in the united states and sell those products primarily in the united states  japan and europe 
as a result  our financial results could be affected by factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
prior to our acquisition of the distribution activities of our top tier distributor in japan and our acquisition of our distributor in the united kingdom  our sales generally were denominated in united states dollars 
since that time  our expenses and revenues in these countries have increasingly been denominated in the applicable foreign currency 
as our operations in japan and the united kingdom increase  we expect that our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations will increase 
changes in exchange rates also may affect the volume of our sales or our foreign currency sales prices compared to those of our foreign competitors and could make our products less competitive in those countries 
if the united states dollar uniformly increased or decreased in strength by relative to the currencies in which our sales were denominated  our net loss would have correspondingly increased or decreased by an estimated  for 
table of contents the year ended december  for purposes of this calculation  we have assumed that the exchange rates would change in the same direction relative to the united states dollar 
our interest income is sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  particularly since the majority of our investments are in short term instruments 
however  as substantially all of our short term investments carry a fixed rate of interest  a hypothetical decrease of in market interest rates would not result in a material decrease in interest income earned on investments held at december  through the date of maturity on those investments 
the fair value of our available for sale securities is also sensitive to changes in the general level of interest rates in the united states  and the fair value of our portfolio will fall if market interest rates increase 
however  since we generally have the ability to hold these investments to maturity  these declines in fair value may never be realized 
if market interest rates were to increase by from levels at december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our financial position as of december  actual results may differ as our analysis of the effects of changes in interest rates does not account for  among other things  sales of securities prior to maturity and repurchase of replacement securities  the change in mix or quality of the investments in the portfolio and changes in the relationship between short term and long term interest rates 
our investment policy permits us to invest funds in excess of current operating requirements in corporate securities including commercial paper  rated a  p or better  and corporate debt instruments  including medium term notes and floating rate notes issued by foreign and domestic corporations  that pay in united states dollars and carry a rating of a or better  bank certificates of deposit and banker s acceptances that are rated at least a or p  united states treasury bills  notes and bonds and united states aaa rated agency securities that carry the direct or implied guarantee of the united states government  including notes  discount notes  medium term notes and floating rate notes  asset backed securities rated a or better  repurchase agreements with major banks and dealers that are recognized as primary dealers by the federal reserve bank of new york  money market mutual funds that offer daily purchase and redemption  and tax exempt tax advantage investments in money market funds  variable rate demand notes  municipal notes or bonds and auction preferred municipal and corporate securities 
in july and august  we received million in aggregate net proceeds in connection with our initial public offering after deducting underwriting discounts and commissions  but before deducting offering expenses payable by us 
we are currently investing net offering proceeds from the offering pursuant to our investment policy 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations and sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
requires that all business combinations initiated after september  be accounted for under the purchase method and addresses the initial recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets acquired in a business combination

table of contents assets subsequent to their acquisition 
sfas no 
provides that intangible assets with finite useful lives be amortized and that goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will not be amortized  but will rather be tested at least annually for impairment 
under the provisions of sfas no 
 any impairment loss identified upon adoption of this standard is recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  which is charged directly to retained earnings 
any impairment loss incurred subsequent to initial adoption of sfas no 
is recorded as a charge to current period earnings 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and stopped amortizing immaterial amounts of goodwill that resulted from business combinations completed prior to september  the adoption of sfas no 
and did not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets and the associated asset retirement costs  including legal obligations

in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  the criteria required for classifying an asset as held for sale have been significantly changed 
assets held for sale are stated at the lower of their fair values or carrying amounts  and depreciation is no longer recognized 
in addition  the expected future operating losses from discontinued operations will be displayed in discontinued operations in the period in which the losses are incurred rather than as of the measurement date 
more dispositions will qualify for discontinued operations treatment in the statement of operations under the new rules 
we adopted sfas no 
january  the adoption of sfas no 
did not have any impact on our financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 which  among other things  changed the presentation of gains and losses on the extinguishment of debt

liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit on activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under issue  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of the company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas no 
also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amount recognized 
we will adopt the provisions of sfas for restructuring activities initiated after december  in november  the fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantee of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation addresses the disclosures to be made by guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued fin no

in accordance with fin no 
 the company adopted the disclosure requirements on december  and is required to adopt the recognition requirements effective on january  the company is evaluating the impact on the recognition requirements of this interpretation and does not expect it to have a material impact on its financial position results of operations  eps or cash flows 

table of contents in december  the fasb issued sfas no

did not have an impact on the company s financial position  results of operations  eps  or cash flows  as the fair value method has not been adopted 
risk factors we have a history of losses and may experience losses in the future  which may result in the market price of our common stock declining since our inception  we have incurred significant net losses and we may incur net losses in we anticipate that our expenses may increase substantially in the foreseeable future as we continue to invest in research and development to enhance our algo screening  neoblue phototherapy device and develop new products and technologies  develop additional applications for our current technology  such as the use of our co stat analyzer for the detection of pre term labor and pre eclampsia  increase our marketing and selling activities  particularly outside the united states  continue to increase the size and number of locations of our customer support organization  particularly outside the united states  and develop additional infrastructure and hire required management and other employees to keep pace with our growth 
as a result of these possible increased expenses  we may need to generate significantly higher revenues to achieve profitability 
we cannot be certain that we will achieve profitability in the future or  if we achieve profitability  sustain it 
if we do not achieve and maintain profitability  the market price of our common stock is likely to decline  perhaps substantially 
we have relied  and expect to continue to rely  on sales of our algo screening product family for substantially all of our revenues  and a decline in sales of these products could cause our revenues to fall historically  we have derived substantially all of our revenues from sales of our algo screening products 
we expect that the revenues from our algo screening product family will continue to account for a substantial majority of our revenues for at least the next two years 
to date  our minimuffs product  which is a disposable ear cover for newborns  and our co stat analyzer product  which is a jaundice management device for newborns  have accounted for only a small percentage of our revenues 
we have not derived any significant revenues from sales of our co stat analyzer products and have recently decreased sales and marketing resources devoted to these products 
we are also currently evaluating the viability of marketing our co stat products in the newborn jaundice market and may determine to cease these marketing efforts altogether 
we introduced our neoblue phototherapy device in october and do not expect to recognize any material revenues from this product during  if ever 
any factors adversely affecting the pricing of our algo screening equipment and related disposables or demand for our algo screening products  including physician acceptance or the selection of competing products  could cause our revenues to decline and our business to suffer 

table of contents if more physicians do not adopt our algo screening products  co stat analyzer products and neoblue phototherapy device  we will not achieve future sales growth we acquired the algo screening product technology in  introduced our co stat analyzer product in january and introduced our neoblue phototherapy device in october more neonatologists and pediatricians must adopt these products for our sales to increase 
to date  we have not achieved the revenue levels we previously anticipated with respect to our co stat products and have decreased the resources devoted to these products 
we believe that physicians will not use our products unless they determine  based on published peer reviewed journal articles  long term clinical data and experience  that the products provide an accurate and cost effective alternative to other means of testing for hearing impairment or jaundice management 
there are currently alternative hearing screening and jaundice management products  which may be less expensive or may be quicker on a per test basis 
physicians are traditionally slow to adopt new products  testing practices and treatments  partly because of perceived liability risks and the uncertainty of third party reimbursement 
if more neonatologists and pediatricians do not adopt our products  we may never have significant revenues or achieve and maintain profitability 
factors that may affect the medical community s acceptance of our products  some of which are beyond our control  include the changing governmental and physician group guidelines for screening of newborns  particularly with respect to full term babies  the performance  quality  price and total cost of ownership of our screening and jaundice management products relative to other screening and jaundice management products for newborns  our ability to maintain and enhance our existing relationships and to form new relationships with leading physician organizations  hospitals and third party payors  changes in state and third party payor reimbursement policies for newborn screening equipment  and the adoption of state and foreign laws requiring universal newborn screening 
a continuation of the general economic downturn in the united states or abroad may reduce our revenue and harm our business the primary customers for our products are neonatologists  physicians  audiologists  hospitals and government agencies 
any significant downturn in domestic or global economic conditions which results in the reduction of the capital spending budgets of our customers or a delay in capital equipment purchases would likely result in a decline in demand for our products and could be detrimental to our business 
economic growth in the united states and other countries has slowed significantly and many commentators believe that the united states economy is experiencing a recession 
overall  customer spending is getting tighter and spending decisions are being more closely scrutinized 
these conditions have negatively impacted our business and may continue to do so if they persist 
like other companies  we currently have very limited visibility with respect to our near term quarters and are having difficulty predicting our revenues and operating results during these periods 
a sluggish economy as a result of recent and future terrorist attacks and the uncertainty of war could have an adverse effect on our business the september  terrorist attacks in new york and washington dc contributed to the slowdown in the united states economy and the economies of other countries 
at the time of the attacks  capital investment by businesses  particularly capital investment in technology  had been experiencing substantial weakness 
continuing economic and political uncertainties  both domestically and abroad  resulting from these attacks and the uncertainty of war have resulted in declines in new technology investments by our customers  including investment in our products 
we do not know what further effect future terrorist attacks  or resulting military actions by the united states and war  could have on our business  revenues or results of operations 
if our customers or potential customers defer or cancel purchases of our products  our revenues will be adversely affected  which would harm our results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents our quarterly operating results may fluctuate  which could cause our stock price to fluctuate our revenues and operating results have varied significantly from quarter to quarter in the past and may continue to fluctuate in the future 
the following are among the factors that could cause our revenues  operating results and margins to fluctuate significantly from quarter to quarter the budgeting cycle of our customers  the size and timing of specific sales  such as large purchases of screening equipment or disposables by government agencies or hospital systems  product and price competition  trade in allowances or other concessions in connection with the introduction of new products or improvements to existing products  the timing and market acceptance of new product introductions and product enhancements by us and our competitors  such as the expected reduction in demand for and potential inventory obsolescence relating to our existing algo screener prior to or after the announced launch date of our next generation algo screener  the length of our sales cycle  the loss of key sales personnel or international distributors  and changes caused by the rapidly evolving market for newborn screening products 
in addition  if a majority of our customers were to implement enterprise wide evaluation programs or purchase products for the entire organization at once  our sales cycle could lengthen and our revenues could be erratic from quarter to quarter 
we have limited historical experience selling our products other than our hearing screening products and cannot determine how the sales cycle for these products will affect our revenues 
the sales cycle  however  could be protracted and could result in further unpredictability in our revenues from quarter to quarter 
many of these factors are beyond our control  and we believe that you should not rely on our results of operations for interim periods as an indication of our expected results in any future period 
if our revenues vary significantly from quarter to quarter  our business could be difficult to manage and our quarterly results could be below expectations of investors and stock market analysts  which could cause our stock price to fluctuate 
our operating results have been and may continue to be subject to seasonal fluctuations we experience seasonality in the sale of our screening equipment 
for example  our sales typically decline from our fourth fiscal quarter to our first fiscal quarter 
we anticipate that we will continue to experience relatively lower sales in our first fiscal quarter due to patterns in the capital budgeting and purchasing cycles of our current and prospective customers  many of which are government agencies 
we may also experience declining sales in the third fiscal quarter due to summer holiday and vacation schedules 
these seasonal factors may lead to fluctuations in our quarterly operating results 
it is difficult for us to evaluate the degree to which the summer slow down and capital budgeting and customer purchasing cycle variations may make our revenues unpredictable in the future 
our operating results may decline if we do not succeed in developing  acquiring and marketing additional newborn products or improving our existing products we intend to develop additional testing products for the diagnosis and monitoring of common medical conditions in infants and pregnant women 
developing new products and improving our existing products to meet the needs of neonatologists and pediatricians requires significant investments in research and development 

table of contents if we fail to successfully develop and market new products and update our existing products  our operating results may decline as our existing products reach the end of their commercial life cycles 
our future growth and profitability will depend  at least in part  on our ability to achieve volume sales of our co stat analyzer and neoblue phototherapy products we introduced our co stat analyzer product family for clinical research uses in july and began commercially marketing it in january we introduced our neoblue phototherapy device in october to date  co stat analyzer products and neoblue phototherapy devices have accounted for only a limited portion of our revenues 
we have experienced limited success in marketing and selling our co stat analyzer products and have limited experience marketing and selling our neoblue phototherapy device 
we are currently evaluating the viability of marketing our co stat analyzer products in the newborn jaundice market  but continue to support clinical research and development relating to our co stat analyzer products in this area and for other clinical applications 
our future growth and profitability will depend  in part  on our ability to commercially sell co stat analyzer products and the neoblue phototherapy device in volume 
we cannot be certain that our co stat analyzer products or our neoblue phototherapy device will be successful  that a market for these products will develop at all or that physicians  governments or other third party vendors will accept and adopt these products 
physicians may not adopt or continue to use our co stat analyzer or neoblue phototherapy products if we cannot show that these products are cost effective or if clinical data does not support our products  which would harm our operating results one clinical study has concluded that our co stat analyzer product is more cost effective than another test for detecting hemolysis in jaundiced newborns 
our safety  effectiveness  reliability  sensitivity and specificity data for the use of our co stat analyzer products for purposes of newborn jaundice management is based in part on a study of over  newborns conducted in in addition  clinical research is ongoing with respect to additional applications for our co stat analyzer  most notably the detection of medical conditions leading to pre term delivery 
with respect to our neoblue phototherapy device  initial data from clinical research suggests that the device may be more effective in treating hyperbilirubinemea than other currently marketed phototherapy products 
we cannot be certain that clinical studies will produce results that are favorable to our products 
if studies and clinical experience do not support our products or demonstrate their cost effectiveness  our products may not gain commercial acceptance and may not be accepted by physicians and governments  which would harm our operating results 
in addition  we could be subject to significant liability for any failure of our products to perform properly  and could have similar problems with any other product we offer in the future 
if the guidelines for recommended universal newborn screening do not continue to develop in the united states and foreign countries  and governments do not require testing of all newborns as we anticipate  our revenues may not grow because our products will not be needed for universal newborn screening the demand for our screening products depends  in part  upon state and foreign governments adoption of universal screening requirements for the disorders for which our products screen 
the guidelines for universal newborn screening for hearing impairment and jaundice monitoring have been adopted by some physician groups and governments only recently 
we cannot predict the outcome or the impact that statutes and government regulations requiring universal newborn screening will have on our sales 
the widespread adoption of these guidelines will depend on our ability to educate government agencies  neonatologists  pediatricians  third party payors and hospital administrators about the benefits of universal newborn hearing testing and the benefits of universal newborn hemolysis monitoring  as well as the use of our products to perform the screening and monitoring 

table of contents our revenues may not grow if densely populated states and foreign countries do not adopt guidelines requiring universal newborn hearing screening or if those guidelines have a long phase in period if the governments in the most densely populated states and foreign countries do not require universal screening for the disorders for which our products test  our business would be harmed and our revenues may not grow 
as of december   states and the district of columbia had mandated universal newborn hearing screening  but the phase in of these guidelines varies widely from six months to four years 
to date  there has been only limited adoption of newborn hearing screening prior to hospital discharge by foreign governments 
our revenues may not grow if hospitals are slow to comply with these guidelines or the applicable government provides for a lengthy phase in period for compliance 
our revenues may not grow if state and foreign governments do not mandate hemolysis monitoring as the standard of care for newborn jaundice screening  or if we are not able to successfully establish other uses for our co stat analyzer products to date  physician groups and federal  state and local governments have not mandated the screening methodology to be used for newborn jaundice management or established monitoring of hemolysis as the best practice 
if these mandates or practice recommendations are not issued  or we are unable to successfully establish other uses for our co stat analyzer products  a market may not develop for our co stat analyzer products 
any failure in our efforts to educate clinicians  government and other third party payors could significantly reduce our product sales it is critical to the success of our sales efforts that we educate a sufficient number of clinicians  hospital administrators and government agencies about our products and the costs and benefits of their use 
the success of our products depends upon physician  government agency and other third party payor confidence in the benefits of our products as well as their comfort with the reliability  sensitivity and specificity of our products 
the impact of our products will not be demonstrable unless highly sensitive and specific evaluations are performed on a substantial number of newborns  including those who do not have risk factors for hearing impairment or who do not display signs of jaundice 
if we fail to demonstrate the effectiveness of our products and the potential long term benefits to patients and third party payors of universal newborn screening  our products will not be adopted 
if health care providers are not adequately reimbursed for procedures conducted with our equipment or for our products  we may never achieve significant revenues physicians  hospitals and state agencies are unlikely to purchase our products if clinicians are not adequately reimbursed for the procedures conducted with our equipment or the disposable products needed to conduct screenings 
unless a sufficient amount of positive  peer reviewed clinical data about our products has been published  third party payors  including insurance companies and government agencies  may refuse to provide reimbursement for the cost of newborn hearing screening and jaundice management with our products 
furthermore  even if reimbursement is provided  it may not be adequate to fully compensate the clinicians or hospitals 
some third party payors may refuse adequate reimbursement unless the infant has demonstrable risk factors 
if health care providers cannot obtain sufficient reimbursement from third party payors for our products or the screenings conducted with our products  it is unlikely that our products will ever achieve significant market acceptance 
acceptance of our products in international markets will be dependent upon the availability of adequate reimbursement or funding  as the case may be  within prevailing health care payment systems 
reimbursement  funding and health care payment systems vary significantly by country and include both government sponsored health care and private insurance 
although we intend to seek international reimbursement or funding approvals  we may not obtain these approvals in a timely manner or at all 

table of contents even if third party payors provide adequate reimbursement for procedures conducted with our equipment  or for our products  adverse changes in reimbursement policies in general could harm our business we are unable to predict changes in the reimbursement methods used by third party health care payors 
for example  some payors are moving toward a managed care system in which providers contract to provide comprehensive health care for a fixed cost per person 
we cannot assure you that in a managed care system the cost of our products will be incorporated into the overall payment for childbirth and newborn care or that there will be adequate reimbursement for our equipment and disposable products separate from reimbursement for the procedure 
unless the cost of screening is reimbursed as a standard component of the newborn s care  universal screening is unlikely to occur and the number of infants likely to be screened with our products will be substantially reduced 
we have very limited experience selling and marketing products other than our algo screening products  and our failure to develop and manage our sales force or to effectively market and distribute our co stat analyzer  neoblue phototherapy device or other products will hurt our revenues and quarterly results our sales force has achieved limited success selling our co stat analyzer  and has limited experience selling our neoblue phototherapy device and related products  and we cannot predict how successful our sales force will be in selling them in the future 
in order to successfully introduce and penetrate the market for our co stat analyzer and neoblue phototherapy device products  we must sell our products to hospital administrators accustomed to the use of laboratory bench equipment rather than portable point of care screening devices for jaundice management 
we market almost all of our newborn hearing screening products in the united states through a direct sales force 
there are significant risks involved in building and managing our sales force and marketing our products 
we may be unable to hire a sufficient number of qualified sales people with the skills and training to sell our newborn hearing screening and jaundice management products effectively 
furthermore  we do not have any agreements with distributors for domestic sales of our products 
we may not be successful in generating revenues from our co stat or neoblue products because we may encounter difficulties in manufacturing them in commercial quantities we do not have experience manufacturing our co stat or neoblue products in commercial quantities  and we may encounter difficulties in the manufacturing of these products 
we may also increase our manufacturing personnel or increase the volume of products we purchase from contract manufacturers that produce the co stat or neoblue products for us 
if we encounter any of these difficulties  we may not be successful in marketing our co stat or neoblue products  and our revenues and financial condition may be harmed 
if we lose our relationship with any supplier of key product components or our relationship with a supplier deteriorates or key components are not available in sufficient quantities  our manufacturing could be delayed and our business could suffer we contract with third parties for the supply of some of the components used in our products and the production of our disposable products 
some of our suppliers are not obligated to continue to supply us 
for certain of these materials and components  relatively few alternative sources of supply exist 
in addition  the lead time involved in the manufacturing of some of these components can be lengthy and unpredictable 
during  we experienced delays on the part of a supplier to provide us with volume production of our new algo screening flexicoupler supplies 
if these suppliers become unwilling or unable to supply us with our requirements  it might be difficult to establish additional or replacement suppliers in a timely manner or at all 
this would cause our product sales to be disrupted and our revenues and operating results to suffer 

table of contents replacement or alternative sources might not be readily obtainable due to regulatory requirements and other factors applicable to our manufacturing operations 
incorporation of components from a new supplier into our products may require a new or supplemental filing with applicable regulatory authorities and clearance or approval of the filing before we could resume product sales 
this process may take a substantial period of time  and we cannot be assured that we would be able to obtain the necessary regulatory clearance or approval 
this could create supply disruptions that would harm our product sales and operating results 
there is only one natus approved supplier that provides hydrogel  the adhesive used in our disposable products 
in addition  we have relied on a single supplier for the electrochemical sensors used in our co stat analyzer and we have not qualified another vendor for this component 
a disruption in the supply of the adhesive or electrochemical sensors could negatively affect our revenues 
if we or our contract manufacturers were unable to locate another supplier  it could significantly impair our ability to sell our products 
in addition  we may be required to make new or supplemental filings with applicable regulatory authorities prior to our marketing a product containing new materials or produced in a new facility 
if we fail to obtain regulatory approval to use a new material  we may not be able to continue to sell the affected products and revenues and operating results could suffer 
our sales efforts through group purchasing organizations and sales to high volume purchasers may reduce our average selling prices  which would reduce our revenues and gross profits from these sales we have entered  and may in the future enter  into agreements with customers who purchase high volumes of our products 
our agreements with these customers may contain discounts off of our normal selling prices and other special pricing considerations  which could cause our revenues and profit margins to decline 
in addition  we have entered into agreements to sell our products to members of group purchasing organizations  which negotiate volume purchase prices for medical devices and supplies for member hospitals  group practices and other clinics 
while we make sales directly to group purchasing organization members  the members of these group purchasing organizations now receive volume discounts off our normal selling price and may receive other special pricing considerations from us from time to time 
sales to members of one group purchasing organization  novation  llc  accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues in the twelve months ended december   and respectively 
sales to members of group purchasing organizations accounted for approximately  and of our total revenues the twelve months ended december   and respectively 
other of our existing customers may be members of group purchasing organizations with which we do not have agreements 
our sales efforts through group purchasing organizations may conflict with our direct sales efforts to our existing customers 
if we enter into agreements with new group purchasing organizations and some of our existing customers begin purchasing our products through those group purchasing organizations  our revenues and profit margins could decline 
we rely on sales to existing customers for a majority of our revenues  and if our existing customers do not continue to purchase products from us  our revenues may decline we rely on sales of additional screening products to our existing customers for a majority of our revenues 
if we fail to sell additional screening products to our existing customers directly or indirectly  we would experience a material decline in revenues 
because we rely on distributors or sub distributors to sell our products in some markets outside of the united states  our revenues could decline if our existing distributors reduce the volume of purchases from us or if our relationship with any of these distributors is terminated we currently rely on our distributors or sub distributors for a majority of our sales outside the united states 
some distributors also assist us with regulatory approvals and education of physicians and government agencies 
we intend to continue our efforts to increase our sales in europe  japan and other countries with a relatively high level of health care spending on infants 
if we fail to sell our products through our international distributors  we 
table of contents would experience a decline in revenues unless we begin to sell our products directly in those markets 
we cannot be certain that we will be able to attract new international distributors that market our products effectively or provide timely and cost effective customer support and service 
even if we are successful in selling our products through new distributors  the rate of growth of our revenues could be harmed if our existing distributors do not continue to sell a large dollar volume of our products 
none of our existing distributors are obligated to continue selling our products 
if we terminate our relationships with distributors for poor performance  as we have done in the past  we may be subject to foreign laws governing our relationships with our distributors 
these laws may require us to make payments to our distributors even if we terminate our relationship for cause 
some countries require termination payments under common law or legislation that may supercede our contractual relationship with the distributor 
these payments could be equal to a year or more of gross margin on sales of our products that the distributor would have earned 
any required payments would adversely affect our operating results 
our plan to expand in international markets will result in increased costs and may not be successful  which could harm our business we must expand the number of distributors who sell our products or increase our direct international sales presence to significantly penetrate international markets 
we have only recently begun to develop a direct sales force outside the united states 
for example  we acquired our united kingdom distributor in january effective in july  we assumed our japanese distributor s sales and support activities  allowing us direct access to redistributors of our products in japan 
as we continue to increase our direct international sales presence  we will incur higher personnel costs that may not result in additional revenues 
a higher percentage of our sales to international distributors could also impair our revenues due to discounts available to these distributors 
we may not realize corresponding growth in operating results from growth in international sales  due to the higher costs of sales outside of the united states 
even if we are able to successfully expand our direct and indirect international selling efforts  we cannot be certain that we will be able to create or increase demand for our products outside of the united states 
our operating results may suffer because of foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations or strengthening of the united states dollar relative to local currencies prior to january  substantially all of our sales contracts provided for payment in united states dollars 
however  our subsidiary in japan assumed the activities of our top tier distributor in japan in july and our united kingdom subsidiary acquired our distributor in the united kingdom in january since that time  our revenues and expenses in these countries have increasingly begun to be denominated in the applicable foreign currency 
we also have begun to sell our products in other local currencies as we expand our direct international sales 
to date  we have not undertaken any foreign currency hedging transactions  and as a result  our future revenues and expense levels from international operations may be unpredictable due to exchange rate fluctuations 
furthermore  a strengthening of the dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets  and fluctuations in currencies could result in foreign exchange gains and losses associated with the translation of assets denominated in foreign currencies 
we face other risks from foreign operations  which could reduce our operating results and harm our financial condition our international operations are subject to other risks  which include the impact of possible recessions in economies outside the united states  political and economic instability  including instability related to war and terrorist attacks in the united states and abroad  
table of contents contractual provisions governed by foreign law  such as common law rights to sales commissions by terminated distributors  the dependence of demand for our products on health care spending by foreign governments  greater difficulty in accounts receivable collection and longer collection periods  difficulties of staffing and managing foreign operations  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries and potentially conflicting intellectual property rights of third parties under the laws of various foreign jurisdictions  and difficulty in obtaining foreign regulatory approvals 
our failure to obtain necessary fda clearances or approvals or to comply with fda regulations could hurt our ability to commercially distribute and market our products in the united states  and this would harm our business and financial condition unless an exemption applies  each medical device that we wish to market in the united states must first receive one of the following types of fda premarket review authorizations k clearance via section k of the federal food  drug  and cosmetics act of  as amended  or premarket approval via section of the food  drug  and cosmetics act if the fda has determined that the medical device in question poses a greater risk of injury 
the fda s k clearance process usually takes from three to months  but can take longer 
the process of obtaining premarket approval is much more costly  lengthy and uncertain 
premarket approval generally takes from one to three years  but can take even longer 
we cannot assure you that the fda will ever grant either k clearance or premarket approval for any product we propose to market 
furthermore  if the fda concludes that these future products using our technology do not meet the requirements to obtain k clearance  we would have to seek premarket approval 
we cannot assure you that the fda will not impose the more burdensome premarket approval requirement on modifications to our existing products or future products  which in either case could be costly and cause us to divert our attention and resources from the development of new products or the enhancement of existing products 
our business may suffer if we are required to revise our labeling or promotional materials or the fda takes an enforcement action against us for off label uses we may not promote or advertise the algo screener  minimuffs  neoblue phototherapy device or co stat analyzer products  or any future cleared or approved devices  for uses not within the scope of our clearances or approvals or make unsupported promotional claims about the benefits of our products 
if the fda determines that our claims are outside the scope of our clearances or are unsupported it could require us to revise our promotional claims or take enforcement action against us 
if we were subject to such an action by the fda  our sales could be delayed  our revenues could decline and our reputation among clinicians could be harmed 
our business would be harmed if the fda determines that we have failed to comply with applicable regulations or we do not pass an inspection we are subject to inspection and market surveillance by the fda concerning compliance with pertinent regulatory requirements 
if the fda finds that we have failed to comply with these requirements  the agency can institute a wide variety of enforcement actions  ranging from a public warning letter to more severe sanctions such as fines  injunctions and civil penalties  the recall or seizure of our products  
table of contents the issuance of public notices or warnings  the imposition of operating restrictions  partial suspension or total shutdown of production  the refusal of our requests for k clearance or premarket approval of new products  the withdrawal of k clearance or premarket approvals already granted  and criminal prosecution 
if we fail to obtain necessary foreign regulatory approvals in order to market and sell our products outside of the united states  we may not be able to sell our products in other countries our products are regulated outside the united states as medical devices by foreign governmental agencies similar to the fda and are subject to regulatory requirements similar to the fda s 
the time and cost required to obtain market authorization from other countries and the requirements for licensing a product in another country may differ significantly from the fda requirements 
we may not be able to obtain these approvals without incurring significant expenses or at all 
if we or our suppliers fail to comply with applicable regulations  sales of our products could be delayed and our revenues could be harmed every manufacturer of a finished medical device  including us and some of our contract manufacturers and suppliers  is required to demonstrate and maintain compliance with the fda s quality system regulation and comparable regulations of states and other countries 
the fda enforces the quality system regulation through periodic inspections 
although we have passed inspections in the past  we cannot assure you that we or our contract manufacturers will pass any future quality system regulation inspections 
if we or our contract manufacturers fail one of these inspections in the future  our operations could be disrupted and our manufacturing and sales delayed significantly until we can demonstrate adequate compliance 
if we or our contract manufacturers fail to take adequate corrective action in a timely fashion in response to a quality system regulations inspection  the fda could shut down our or our contract manufacturers manufacturing operations and require us  among other things  to recall our products  either of which would harm our business 
we may experience intense competition from other medical device companies  and this competition could adversely affect our revenues and our business our most significant current and potential competitors for our algo screening products include companies that market enhanced auditory brainstem response and otoacoustic hearing screening equipment products 
for jaundice management products  our competition falls into the following categories for blood based antibody and bilirubin tests  we anticipate our competitors to be large medical diagnostics companies that market laboratory bench equipment  for noninvasive analysis of skin tones to estimate the level of jaundice yellowing present in the skin  medium to large in vitro diagnostics companies that market point of care  handheld monitoring devices 
with respect to our neoblue product  our competitors are companies that market phototherapy devices 
we believe that bio logic systems corp  intelligent hearing systems  gn otometrics  including madsen electronics and sonamed corp  each of which is also currently marketing enhanced auditory brainstem response and otoacoustic hearing screening equipment products  could introduce new  lower priced hearing screening equipment that may not require an audiologist or physician to interpret its results or review its recommendations  similar to our products 
bio logic announced that it received fda approval to sell its disposable products for use with versions of our algo screeners other than the algo screener 
the sales of these products has adversely impacted our revenues from sales of our disposable products 
we believe that minolta co  ltd 
and spectrx  inc  each of which is currently marketing skin color analysis products for bilirubin monitoring  or johnson johnson and f 
hoffman la roche ltd  each of which is currently marketing equipment for blood based bilirubin or antibody tests  could also introduce new  lower priced options for the management of newborn 
table of contents jaundice 
we expect that competitors to our neoblue product include these companies 
some of our competitors may have greater financial resources and name recognition or larger  more established distribution channels than we do 
we believe our future success depends on our ability to enhance existing products  develop and introduce new products  satisfy customer requirements and achieve market acceptance 
we cannot be certain that we will successfully identify new product opportunities 
we may not be able to develop and bring new products to market before our competitors or in a more cost effective manner 
increased competition may negatively affect our business and future operating results by leading to price reductions  higher selling expenses or a reduction in our market share 
our business could be harmed if our competitors establish cooperative relationships with large medical testing equipment vendors or rapidly acquire market share through industry consolidation or by bundling other products with their hearing screening or jaundice monitoring products large medical testing equipment vendors  such as johnson johnson or f 
hoffman la roche ltd  may acquire or establish cooperative relationships with our current competitors 
we expect that the medical testing equipment industry will continue to consolidate 
new competitors or alliances among competitors may emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share  which would harm our business and financial prospects 
other medical device companies may decide to bundle their products with other newborn hearing screening  hemolysis monitoring or jaundice management products and sell the bundle at lower prices 
if this happens  our business and future operating results could suffer if we were no longer able to offer commercially viable or competitive products 
we may not be successful in integrating the businesses that we acquire  or the businesses may not perform as projected in march  we acquired intellectual property assets and technology patents from pemstar  and may have additional acquisitions of products  technology assets or acquisitions in the future as part of our efforts to increase revenue and expand our product offerings 
in addition to direct costs  acquisitions pose a number of risks  including integration of the acquired products into our business  the failure to realize expected synergies  the failure of acquired products to achieve projected sales  the failure of our development agreement with pemstar or other contract developers to result in the desired product developments  assumption of unknown liabilities  failure to understand and compete effectively in markets in which we have limited previous experience  and write offs of goodwill and associated technologies or costs associated with such failed new products or businesses 
while we make efforts to analyze potential acquisitions carefully and to value assets and their related future lives appropriately  we cannot be certain that any completed acquisitions will positively impact our business 

table of contents we may not be able to preserve the value of our products intellectual property because we may not be able to protect access to our intellectual property or we may lose our intellectual property rights due to expiration of our licenses or patents if we fail to protect our intellectual property rights or if our intellectual property rights do not adequately cover the technology we employ  other medical device companies could sell hearing screening or jaundice management products with features similar to ours  and this could reduce demand for our products 
we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patent  copyright  trade secret and trademark laws 
we have eighteen issued united states patents and eight patent applications pending before the united states patent and trademark office 
we have one patent granted in canada and four patent applications pending in canada 
we have one patent issued with the european patent office  which we intend to register in ten countries and eleven patent applications pending with the european patent office

we have four patent applications pending in australia  two patent applications pending in the czech republic  one patent application pending in hong kong  two patent applications pending in hungary  one patent application pending in italy and one patent application pending in norway 
we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights by filing patent applications for new features and products we develop 
we enter into confidentiality or license agreements with our employees  consultants and corporate partners and seek to control access to our intellectual property and the distribution of our hearing screening or jaundice management products  documentation and other proprietary information 
however  we believe that these measures afford only limited protection 
others may develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology or design around the patents  copyrights and trade secrets we own 
the original patent for an algorithm for analyzing auditory brainstem responses  which we licensed on a nonexclusive basis from a third party and upon which we developed our automated auditory brainstem response technology  expired in late  and that subject matter is in the public domain 
with respect to our neoblue phototherapy device  the basic concept of using blue lights for phototherapy is well established in the technical literature and is therefore not patentable 
however  we have one patent pending that pertains to some of the features in our neoblue device  and the design and manufacturing methods we use are proprietary to us 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the patent applications we have filed to protect the features of our products that we have subsequently developed will be allowed  or will deter others from using the auditory brainstem response technology 
despite our efforts to protect our proprietary rights  others may attempt to copy or otherwise improperly obtain and use our products or technology 
policing unauthorized use of our technology is difficult and expensive  and we cannot be certain that the steps we have taken will prevent misappropriation  particularly in foreign countries where the laws may not protect our proprietary rights as fully 
our means of protecting our proprietary rights may be inadequate 
enforcing our intellectual property rights could be costly and time consuming and may divert our management s attention and resources 
enforcing our intellectual property rights could also result in the loss of our intellectual property rights 
our operating results would suffer if we were subject to a protracted infringement claim or a significant damage award substantial intellectual property litigation and threats of litigation exist in our industry 
we expect that medical screening equipment may become increasingly subject to third party infringement claims as the number of competitors in our industry segment grows and the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
third parties such as individuals  educational institutions or other medical device companies may claim that we infringe their intellectual property rights 
any claims  with or without merit  could have any of the following negative consequences result in costly litigation and damage awards  divert our management s attention and resources
