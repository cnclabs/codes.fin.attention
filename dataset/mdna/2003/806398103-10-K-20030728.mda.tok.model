the company provided for federal and state taxes at an effective rate of in fiscal the company did not recognize any federal income tax benefit for its operating loss in fiscal due to income allocation and state income tax laws  only part of the company s state income taxes in fiscal were offset by operating losses 
the company provided in state taxes during fiscal liquidity and capital resources the company s cash requirements are based upon its seasonal working capital needs and capital requirements for new shops  if any  fleet and truck centers  if any  and for additions and improvements 
the first and second quarters and  occasionally  the fourth quarter of a fiscal year usually have positive cash flow from operations  while the third and  occasionally  the fourth quarters are net users of cash 
as of april   the company had current assets of  and current liabilities of  for a net working capital of  during fiscal  net cash used in operating activities was  compared with  net cash used in fiscal  and capitalized expenditures were in fiscal the company expects that future cash flow from operations will be enhanced by these capital additions 
during fiscal  the company plans to perform various capital improvements for an estimated cost of approximately the company s long term financial obligations consist of its deferred management compensation plan and loans against various life insurance policies 
the company has no specific assets dedicated to its deferred compensation plan but has entered into life insurance contracts on behalf of certain participants to partially fund its obligations under the deferred compensation plan 
obligations under the deferred compensation plan are generally payable over a year period after the participant attains age and has been employed by the company for at least years 
the company expects to satisfy these obligations by utilizing the accumulated cash values in the insurance contracts net of the related loans  cash to be received through the death benefits in these insurance contracts and cash to be provided in its operating and investing activities 
accumulated cash values under the insurance contracts and the related loan and accrued interest balances at april  totaled   and  respectively  compared to   and  respectively  at april  the company believes that the death benefits under the life insurance contracts along with the accumulated net cash values and cash to be provided from its operating and investing activities  should be adequate to meet its obligations under the deferred compensation plan 
at april  and  the face value of the life insurance policies totaled  and  respectively 
the loans and related accrued interest each of which is against a specific life insurance contract would become immediately payable upon the death of the covered deferred compensation plan participant 
in that event  the company intends to satisfy this liability from the proceeds received from the death benefit 
the proceeds not utilized to repay the loan and accrued interest would be available to satisfy the benefit obligations under the deferred compensation plan 
assuming that all covered participants had died and the company then repaid the related loans and accrued interest at april   the proceeds from the death benefits that would be available to satisfy the undiscounted deferred compensation plan obligations of  generally payable over years totaled  the company arranges for the issuance of standby letters of credit to the benefit of its insurance carriers primarily for the unfunded portion of estimated workers compensation liabilities over different policy years 
during the year ended april   this arrangement was made with the company s bank and required the purchase of certificates of deposit totaling  to secure of the standby letters of credit issued 
at april   certificates of deposit totaling secured of the standby letters of credit issued 
the company believes that any future arrangements will not be on terms significantly less favorable than its existing terms 
in february  the company received a notice of disallowance from the internal revenue service irs disallowing a refund of  from a net operating loss carryback received by the company during its year ended april  the irs is also seeking interest but not penalties on the amount of the refund 
the company protested the irs s position and in a notice dated february   the irs allowed a portion of the refund and stated that the amount of the disallowance and interest thereon would total  as of that date 
as a result  the company recorded a benefit of during the third quarter ended january  for the excess of previously accrued interest expense over that required by the irs at february  though the amount of the disallowance and interest thereon is accrued in the consolidated financial statements at april   such a large single payment would effectively deplete the company s available cash and would require the company to evaluate other financial resources that may be available to it in order to satisfy the payment to the irs 
as a result  the company has filed an offer in compromise with the irs for both the total amount and the payment period 
as of april   the company owned parcels of unencumbered real estate  including the company s paint factory and warehouse  which could be either sold or used as security to obtain additional financing 
the company believes that it has  or has the ability to have  the liquidity and capital resources necessary to meet its cash needs for the foreseeable future 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company engaged an investment banking firm as its exclusive financial advisor with respect to the evaluation  report and recommendation to the board of directors of strategic options designed to maximize shareholder value 
as of april   the company had deferred income tax assets totaling  which realization would require a significant increase from fiscal taxable income to approximately  the company believes  however  that because of the relatively long year expiration period of its federal net operating loss carryforward  combined with its ability to devise tax planning strategies involving the sales of owned real estate  or the likelihood of the consummation of a transaction through the services of the investment banking firm recently engaged  or both  it is more likely than not that the deferred income tax assets will be realized 
see note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of the company s income taxes and the components of the deferred income tax assets

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities and contingencies as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management evaluates its estimates and judgments  including those related to its most critical accounting policies  on an ongoing basis 
management bases its estimates and judgments on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
the company s significant accounting policies are disclosed in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the company believes its critical accounting policies to be in the area of risk management  specifically workers compensation  which records the uninsured or deductible portion of the liability based on estimates of the development of incurred claims  and in the provision for impairment to long lived assets  which is based on the estimate of future cash flows for the operating unit 
changing conditions and the use of different assumptions in deriving these estimates could have a material effect on reported financial results 
the estimate of the company s workers compensation deductible liability is performed by its risk management department  based on claims incurred as of the date of the balance sheet and is reviewed by senior management 
the estimate for this liability is established upon analysis of historical data  discussions with third party insurance carriers and estimates provided by the company s workers compensation third party administrators 
the estimates are subject to a high degree of variability 
on at least an annual basis  the claims are actuarially reviewed 
sources for the variability are numerous and include  but are not limited to  severity and frequency of claims  future economic conditions  court decisions and legislative actions 
the company s workers compensation liability estimates anticipate no change in the benefit structure  but statutory changes could have an impact on the estimated liability 
because of the seasonality of its business  the company reviews its long lived assets for impairment annually as part of the fiscal year end procedures  unless there are events or changes in circumstances that indicate there is a significant question as to whether the respective carrying amounts are recoverable 
the most significant long lived asset is the economic unit of the individual retail paint and body shop 
an evaluation is performed annually on all shops operating for at least a year and an impairment write down is recognized if a shop s estimated undiscounted future cash flows are less than its carrying amount 
the company primarily uses historical performance in determining its estimate of the undiscounted future cash flows  but future cash flows are influenced by  among other factors  changes in competition  marketing strategy  human resources and general market conditions 
these factors could affect the amount  if any  of the impairment provision recognized 
changing conditions and the use of different assumptions in deriving the estimates described above could have a material effect on reported financial results
