fiscal organization structure after the end of fiscal  we reorganized our business operations into the following groups the analog group  the displays and wireless group  the pc and networking group  the imaging group  and the custom solutions group 
this reorganization was done to reflect our decisions to exit the cellular baseband business and the geodetm product line within the information appliance business 
we do not expect this change to materially affect the way we define and report our operating segments under sfas worldwide marketing and sales and central technology and manufacturing group separate from our business operating groups  our corporate structure includes a centralized worldwide marketing and sales group and a central technology and manufacturing group ctmg 
worldwide marketing and sales is structured around the four major regions of the world where we operate the americas north and south  europe  japan and asia pacific and unites our worldwide sales and marketing organization 
ctmg manages all production  including manufacturing requirements that are outsourced  and central support technology 
central support technology includes process technology  which provides pure research and process development necessary for many of our core production processes  packaging technology and leading edge research 
ctmg provides a range of process libraries  product cores and software that are shared among our product lines to develop system level solutions 
this group is also responsible for the selection and usage of common support tools  including integrated computer aided design for design  layout and simulation 
segment financial information and geographic information for segment reporting purposes  each of our product line business units represents an operating segment as defined under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information 
business units that have similarities  including economic characteristics  underlying technology  markets and customers  are aggregated into larger segments 
under the criteria in sfas no 
 we have four reportable segments for fiscal o analog segment  o information appliance segment  o enterprise networking segment  o enhanced solutions segment 
prior to fiscal  the enterprise networking and enhanced solutions segments were previously included with all other segments in the caption all others 
for further financial information on these segments  refer to the information contained in note  segment and geographic information  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item marketing and sales we market our products globally to original equipment manufacturers and original design manufacturers through a direct sales force 
major oems and odms include o bosch  o lg electronics  o samsung  o dell  o lm ericsson  o siemens  o hewlett packard  o motorola  o sony  and o ibm  o nokia  o sony ericsson mobile communication 
o kyocera  o quanta  there has been an increasing trend in the technology industry where oems use contract manufacturers to build their products and odms to design and build products 
as a result  our design wins with major oems  particularly in the personal computer and cellular phone markets  can ultimately result in sales to a contract manufacturer 
in addition to our direct sales force  we use distributors in our four business regions  and approximately percent of our total worldwide sales are generated through distributors 
in an increasing portion of our distribution sales  the distributor acts as the logistics partner for our oem customers and their contract manufacturers 
in line with industry practices  we generally credit distributors for the effect of price reductions on their inventory of our products and  under specific conditions  we repurchase products that we have discontinued 
our comprehensive central facilities in the united states  europe  japan and singapore handle customer support 
these customer support centers respond to inquiries on product pricing and availability  customer technical support requests  order entry and scheduling 
we augment our sales effort with application engineers based in the field 
these engineers are specialists in our product portfolio and work with customers to identify and design our integrated circuits into customers products and applications 
these engineers also help identify emerging markets for new products and are supported by our design centers in the field or at manufacturing sites 
customers we are not dependent upon any single customer  the loss of which would have a material effect on our operating results 
the distributor arrow accounted for percent of total net sales in fiscal as a result of its acquisition of pioneer in february  in addition  the distributor avnet accounted for approximately percent of total net sales in fiscal and no one customer or distributor accounted for percent or more of total net sales in fiscal backlog in accordance with industry practice  we frequently revise semiconductor backlog quantities and shipment schedules under outstanding purchase orders to reflect changes in customer needs 
we rarely formally enforce binding agreements for the sale of specific quantities at specific prices that are contractually subject to price or quantity revisions  consistent with industry practice 
for these reasons  we do not believe it is meaningful to disclose the amount of backlog at any particular date 
seasonality we are affected by the seasonal trends of the semiconductor and related industries 
we typically experience sequentially lower sales in our first and third fiscal quarters  primarily due to customer vacation and holiday schedules 
sales usually reach a seasonal peak in our fourth fiscal quarter 
fiscal was consistent with these trends  although market conditions for the semiconductor industry were improved over fiscal manufacturing the design of semiconductor and integrated circuit products is shaped by general market needs and customer requirements 
following product design and development  we produce integrated circuits in the following steps o wafer fabrication 
product designs are compiled and digitized by state of the art design equipment and then transferred to silicon wafers in a series of complex precision processes that include oxidation  lithography  chemical etching  diffusion  deposition  implantation and metallization 
o wafer sort 
the silicon wafers are tested and separated into individual circuit devices 
o product assembly 
tiny wires are used to connect the electronic circuits on the device to the stronger metal leads of the package in which the device is encapsulated for protection 
o final test 
the devices are subjected to a series of vigorous tests using computerized circuit testers and  for certain applications  environmental testers such as burn in ovens  centrifuges  temperature cycle or moisture resistance testers  salt atmosphere testers and thermal shock testers 
o coating 
certain devices in the analog portfolio are designed to be used without traditional packaging 
in this case  the integrated circuit is coated with a protective material and mounted directly onto the circuit board 
we conduct product design and development work predominantly in the united states 
wafer fabrication is concentrated in two facilities in the united states and one in scotland 
nearly all product assembly and final test operations are performed in two facilities in southeast asia 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we began construction of an assembly and test facility in china to expand our business presence in the asia markets 
for capacity utilization and other economic reasons  we employ subcontractors to perform certain manufacturing functions in the united states  europe  israel  southeast asia and japan 
our wafer manufacturing processes span bipolar  metal oxide silicon  complementary metal oxide silicon and bipolar complementary metal oxide silicon technologies  including silicon germanium 
we are focusing our wafer fabrication processes to emphasize the development of new analog and mixed signal technology based products for applications aimed at wireless handsets  displays  imaging and human interface and information infrastructure 
bipolar processes primarily support our standard products 
the width of the individual transistors on a chip is measured in microns  one micron equals one millionth of a meter 
as products decrease in size and increase in functionality  our wafer fabrication facilities must be able to manufacture integrated circuits with sub micron circuit pattern widths 
this precision fabrication carries over to assembly and test operations  where advanced packaging technology and comprehensive testing are required to address the ever increasing performance and complexity embedded in current integrated circuits 
raw materials our manufacturing processes use certain key raw materials critical to our products 
these include silicon wafers  certain chemicals and gases  ceramic and plastic packaging materials and various precious metals 
we also rely on subcontractors to supply finished or semi finished products which we then market through our sales channels 
we obtain raw materials and semi finished or finished products from various sources  although the number of sources for any particular material or product is relatively limited 
we feel our current supply of essential materials is adequate 
however  shortages have occurred from time to time and could occur again 
significant increases in demand  rapid product mix changes or natural disasters could affect our ability to procure materials or goods 
research and development our research and development efforts consist of research in metallurgical  electro mechanical and solid state sciences  manufacturing process development and product design 
research functions and development of most process technologies are done by ctmg s process technology group 
total r d expenses were million for fiscal  or percent of sales  compared to million for fiscal  or percent of sales  and million for fiscal  or percent of sales 
these amounts exclude in process r d charges of million related to the acquisition of digitalquake in fiscal  million related to the acquisitions of fincitec  arsmikro and wireless solutions sweden in fiscal and million related to the acquisitions of innocomm wireless and vivid semiconductor in fiscal these in process r d charges are included in our consolidated statements of operations as a component of special items 
during fiscal  we devoted approximately percent of our r d effort towards new product development and percent towards the development of process and support technology 
compared to fiscal  this represents a percent increase in spending for new product development and an percent decrease towards the development of process and support technology 
a significant and increasing portion of our r d efforts will be aimed in the future at developing new analog products 
patents we own numerous united states and non us patents and have many patent applications pending 
we consider the development of patents and the maintenance of an active patent program advantageous to the conduct of our business 
however  we believe that continued success will depend more on engineering  production  marketing  financial and managerial skills than on our patent program 
we license certain of our patents to other manufacturers and participate in a number of cross licensing arrangements and agreements with other parties 
each license agreement has unique terms and conditions  with variations as to length of term  royalties payable  permitted uses and scope 
the majority of these agreements are cross licenses in which we grant broad licenses to our intellectual property in exchange for receiving a similar corresponding license from the other party and none are exclusive 
the amount of income we have received from licensing agreements has varied in the past  and we cannot precisely forecast the amount and timing of future income from licensing agreements 
on an overall basis  we believe that no single license agreement is material to us  either in terms of royalty payments due or payable or intellectual property rights granted or received 
employees at may   we employed approximately  people of whom approximately  were employed in the united states   in europe   in southeast asia and in other areas 
we believe that our future success depends fundamentally on our ability to recruit and retain skilled technical and professional personnel 
our employees in the united states are not covered by collective bargaining agreements 
we consider our employee relations worldwide to be favorable 
competition competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
we compete with a number of major corporations in the high volume segment of the industry 
these include several multinational companies whose semiconductor business may be only part of their overall operations  such as koninklijke royal philips electronics  matsushita  motorola  nec  samsung and toshiba 
we also compete with a large number of corporations such as texas instruments  st microelectronics  maxim  analog devices and linear technology that sell competing products into some of the same markets that we target 
competition is based on design and quality of products  product performance  price and service  with the relative importance of these factors varying among products and markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 
we may also compete with several of our customers  particularly customers in the networking and personal systems markets 
environmental regulations to date  our compliance with federal  state and local laws or regulations that have been enacted to regulate the environment has not had a material adverse effect on our capital expenditures  earnings  competitive or financial position 
for more information  see item  legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies to the consolidated financial statements in item however  we could be subject to fines  suspension of production  alteration of our manufacturing processes or cessation of our operations if we fail to comply with present or future statutes and regulations governing the use  storage  handling  discharge or disposal of toxic  volatile or otherwise hazardous chemicals used in our manufacturing processes 
item properties we conduct manufacturing  as well as process research and product development  in our wafer fabrication facilities located in arlington  texas  south portland  maine  and greenock  scotland 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization for fiscal  based on wafer starts  was percent  as production activity increased in response to improved business conditions in the semiconductor industry 
this compares with wafer fabrication capacity utilization for fiscal of percent when production activity was much lower due to weaker business conditions in the semiconductor industry 
we expect our captive manufacturing capacity and our third party subcontract manufacturing arrangements to be adequate to supply our needs in the foreseeable future 
our assembly and test functions are performed primarily in southeast asia 
these facilities are located in melaka  malaysia and toa payoh  singapore 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we began construction of an assembly and test facility in suzhou  china to expand our business presence in the asia markets 
the facility is expected to be completed and operational in fiscal our principal administrative and research facilities are located in santa clara  california 
our regional headquarters for worldwide marketing and sales are located in santa clara  california  munich  germany  tokyo  japan  and kowloon  hong kong 
we maintain local sales offices and sales service centers in various locations and countries throughout our four business regions 
we also operate small design facilities in various locations in the us  including austin  texas  irvine  california  rochester  new york  calabasas  california  kirkland  washington  salem  new hampshire  federal way  washington  longmont  colorado  san diego  california  fort collins  colorado  nashua  new hampshire  santa clara  california  grass valley  california  norcross  georgia  south portland  maine  indianapolis  indiana  phoenix  arizona  tucson  arizona  and at overseas locations including china  estonia  finland  germany  india  israel  japan  the netherlands  sweden  taiwan and the united kingdom 
we own our manufacturing facilities and our corporate headquarters 
in general  we lease most of our sales and administrative offices 
item legal proceedings we currently are a party to various legal proceedings  including those noted below 
while management currently believes that the ultimate outcome of these proceedings  individually and in the aggregate  will not have a material adverse effect on our financial position or overall trends in results of operations  litigation is subject to inherent uncertainties  and unfavorable rulings could occur 
an unfavorable ruling could include money damages or an injunction prohibiting us from selling one or more products 
were an unfavorable ruling to occur  there exists the possibility of a material adverse impact on the net income of the period in which the ruling occurs  or future periods 
tax matters the irs is in the process of examining our tax returns for fiscal years through at the end of fiscal  there were no outstanding unresolved issues with the irs from prior audits and examinations 
we are in the process of undergoing a tax audit in the netherlands and from time to time our tax returns are audited in the us by state agencies and at international locations by local tax authorities 
we believe we have made adequate tax payments and or accrued adequate amounts in our financial statements to cover any deficiencies the irs or other government agencies may find in these audits 
environmental matters we have been named to the national priorities list superfund for our santa clara  california site and we have completed a remedial investigation feasibility study with the regional water quality control board  which is acting as agent for the epa 
we have agreed in principle with the rwqcb on a site remediation plan 
in addition to the santa clara site  we have been designated from time to time as a potentially responsible party by federal and state agencies for certain environmental sites with which we may have had direct or indirect involvement 
these designations are made regardless of the extent of our involvement 
these claims are in various stages of administrative or judicial proceedings and include demands for recovery of past governmental costs and for future investigations and remedial actions 
in many cases  the dollar amounts of the claims have not been specified and the claims have been asserted against a number of other entities for the same cost recovery or other relief as is sought from us 
we have also assumed liability for environmental matters arising from our former operations of dynacraft  inc and the fairchild business  but we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings relating to those liabilities 
we accrue costs associated with environmental matters when they become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of all environmental charges to earnings  including charges relating to the santa clara site remediation  excluding potential reimbursements from insurance coverage  has not been material during the last three fiscal years 
we believe that the potential liability for environmental matters  if any  in excess of amounts already accrued in our financial statements will not have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
other in november  a derivative action was filed in the us district court in delaware against us  fairchild semiconductor international  inc and sterling holding company  llc  by mark levy  a fairchild stockholder 
the action was brought under section b of the securities exchange act of and the rules issued under that act by the securities and exchange commission 
the plaintiff seeks disgorgement of alleged short swing insider trading profits 
we had originally acquired fairchild common and preferred stock in march at the time we disposed of the fairchild business 
prior to its initial public offering in august  fairchild had amended its certificate of incorporation to provide that all fairchild preferred stock would convert automatically to common stock upon completion of the initial public offering 
as a result  our shares of preferred stock converted to common stock in august plaintiff has alleged that the acquisition of common stock through the conversion constituted an acquisition that should be matched against our sale in january of fairchild common stock for purposes of computing short swing trading profits 
the action seeks to recover from us on behalf of fairchild alleged recoverable profits of approximately million 
in february  the judge in the case granted the motion to dismiss filed by us and our co defendants and dismissed the case  ruling that the conversion was done pursuant to a reclassification which is exempt from the scope of section b 
plaintiff appealed the dismissal of the case and upon appeal  the us court of appeals for the third circuit reversed the district court s dismissal 
our petition for a panel rehearing and or rehearing en banc was denied by the appeals court in april our motion to stay the issuance of the appeals court mandate to the district court pending our petition to the us supreme court was denied in may we intend to continue to contest the case through all available means 
in january  a class action suit was filed against us and a number of our suppliers in california superior court by james harris and other former and present employees claiming damages for personal injury 
the complaint alleges that cancer and or reproductive harm were caused to employees as a result of alleged exposure to toxic chemicals while working at our company 
plaintiffs claim to have worked at sites in santa clara and or in greenock  scotland 
in addition  one plaintiff claims to represent a class of children of company employees who allegedly sustained developmental harm as a result of alleged in utero exposure to toxic chemicals while their mothers worked at the company 
although no specific amount of monetary damages is claimed  plaintiffs seek damages on behalf of the classes for personal injuries  nervous shock  physical and mental pain  fear of future illness  medical expenses and loss of earnings and earnings capacity 
at the present time  the court has required the scottish employees to seek their remedies in scottish courts 
plaintiffs are presently seeking to certify a medical monitoring class  which we are opposing 
discovery in the case is proceeding and we intend to defend this action vigorously

item selected financial data the following selected financial information has been derived from audited consolidated financial statements 
the information set forth below is not necessarily indicative of results of future operations and should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations in item and the consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto in item five year selected financial data years ended in millions  except per share amounts and may  may  may  may  may  employee figures operating results net sales      operating costs and expenses      operating income loss  interest income expense  net other income expense  net income loss before income taxes  income tax expense benefit net income loss  earnings loss per share basic diluted weighted average common and potential common shares outstanding basic diluted financial position at year end working capital total assets      long term debt total debt shareholders equity     other data research and development capital additions number of employees in thousands we did not pay cash dividends on our common stock in any of the years presented above 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto o critical accounting policies we believe the following critical accounting policies are those policies that have a significant effect on the determination of our financial position and results of operations 
these policies also require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments a revenue recognition we recognize revenue from the sale of semiconductor products upon shipment  provided title and risk of loss have passed to the customer  the amount is fixed or determinable and collection of the revenue is reasonably assured 
service revenues are recognized as the services are provided or as milestones are achieved  depending on the terms of the arrangement 
we record a provision for estimated future returns at the time of shipment 
approximately percent of our semiconductor product sales are made through distributors 
we have agreements with our distributors that cover various programs  including pricing adjustments based on resales  scrap allowances and volume incentives 
the revenue we record for these distribution sales is net of estimated provisions for these programs 
when determining this net distribution revenue  we must make significant judgments and estimates 
our estimates are based upon historical experience rates  inventory levels in the distribution channel  current economic trends  and other related factors 
to date  the actual distributor returns activity has been materially consistent with the provisions we have made based on our estimates 
however  because of the inherent nature of estimates  there is always a risk that there could be significant differences between actual amounts and our estimates 
our financial condition and operating results are dependent on our ability to make reliable estimates and we believe that our estimates are reasonable 
however  different judgments or estimates could result in variances that might be significant to reported operating results 
intellectual property income is not classified as revenue 
this income is classified as non operating income and is recognized when the license is delivered  the fee is fixed or determinable  collection of the fee is reasonably assured and no further obligations to the other party exist 
b inventories inventories are stated at the lower of standard cost  which approximates actual cost on a first in  first out basis  or market 
we reduce the carrying value of inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory by an amount that is the difference between its cost and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
our products are classified as either custom  which are those products manufactured with customer specified features or characteristics  or non custom  which are those products that do not have customer specified features or characteristics 
we evaluate obsolescence by analyzing the inventory aging  order backlog and future customer demand on an individual product basis 
if actual demand were to be substantially lower than what we have estimated  we may be required to write down inventory below the current carrying value 
while our estimates require us to make significant judgments and assumptions regarding future events  we believe our relationships with our customers  combined with our understanding of the end markets we serve  provide us with the ability to make reliable estimates 
to date the actual amount of obsolete or unmarketable inventory has been materially consistent with previously estimated write downs we have recorded 
we also evaluate the carrying value of inventory for lower of cost or market on an individual product basis  and these evaluations are intended to identify any difference between net realizable value and standard cost 
net realizable value is determined as the selling price of the product less the estimated cost of disposal 
when necessary  we reduce the carrying value of inventory to net realizable value 
if actual market conditions and resulting product sales were to be less favorable than what we have projected  additional inventory write downs may be required 
c impairment of goodwill  intangible assets and other long lived assets we assess the impairment of long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable from the estimated future cash flows expected to result from their use and eventual disposition 
our long lived assets subject to this evaluation include property  plant and equipment and amortizable intangible assets 
we assess the impairment of goodwill annually in our fourth fiscal quarter and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that it is more likely than not that an impairment loss has been incurred 
intangible assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be fully recoverable 
other intangible assets subject to this evaluation include developed technology we have acquired  patents and technology licenses 
we are required to make judgments and assumptions in identifying those events or changes in circumstances that may trigger impairment 
some of the factors we consider include o significant decrease in the market value of an asset o significant changes in the extent or manner for which the asset is being used or in its physical condition o a significant change  delay or departure in our business strategy related to the asset o significant negative changes in the business climate  industry or economic conditions o current period operating losses or negative cash flow combined with a history of similar losses or a forecast that indicates continuing losses associated with the use of an asset in view of the generally weak current economic climate  we are periodically evaluating whether an impairment of our amortizable intangible assets and other long lived assets has occurred 
our evaluation includes an analysis of estimated future undiscounted net cash flows expected to be generated by the assets over their remaining estimated useful lives 
if the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows are insufficient to recover the carrying value of the assets over the remaining estimated useful lives  we will record an impairment loss in the amount by which the carrying value of the assets exceeds the fair value 
we determine fair value based on discounted cash flows using a discount rate commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
if  as a result of our analysis  we determine that our amortizable intangible assets or other long lived assets have been impaired  we will recognize an impairment loss in the period in which the impairment is determined 
any such impairment charge could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations 
major factors that influence our cash flow analysis are our estimates for future revenue and expenses associated with the use of the asset 
different estimates could have a significant impact on the results of our evaluation 
we performed our annual review for goodwill impairment in the fourth quarter of fiscal and tested for goodwill impairment in each reporting unit that contains goodwill 
we also performed additional tests of our wireless reporting unit in february when we announced our intention to sell our cellular baseband business unit and in may when we subsequently announced the immediate closure of that business unit 
the cellular baseband business unit was a part of the wireless reporting unit 
our tests found that no impairment existed 
our impairment review is based on comparing the fair value to the carrying value of the reporting units with goodwill 
the fair value of a reporting unit is measured at the business unit level using a discounted cash flow approach that incorporates our estimates of future revenues and costs for those business units 
reporting units with goodwill include our wireless  displays  power management and data conversion business units  which are operating segments within our analog reportable segment  and our enterprise networking reporting unit  which is a reportable segment 
our estimates are consistent with the plans and estimates that we are using to manage the underlying businesses 
if we fail to deliver new products for these business units  or if the products fail to gain expected market acceptance  or market conditions for these businesses fail to improve  our revenue and cost forecasts may not be achieved and we may incur charges for goodwill impairment  which could be significant and could have a material adverse effect on our net equity and results of operations 
d deferred income taxes we determine deferred tax liabilities and assets at the end of each period based on the future tax consequences that can be attributed to net operating loss and credit carryovers and differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases  using the tax rate expected to be in effect when the taxes are actually paid or recovered 
the recognition of deferred tax assets is reduced by a valuation allowance if it is more likely than not that the tax benefits will not be realized 
the ultimate realization of deferred tax assets depends upon the generation of future taxable income during the periods in which those temporary differences become deductible 
we consider past performance  expected future taxable income and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the amount of the valuation allowance 
our forecast of expected future taxable income is based over such future periods that we believe can be reasonably estimated 
changes in market conditions that differ materially from our current expectations and changes in future tax laws in the us and in international jurisdictions may cause us to change our judgements of future taxable income 
these changes  if any  may require us to adjust our existing tax valuation allowance higher or lower than the amount we have recorded 
o overview during fiscal  we began a series of strategic profit improvement actions designed to increase our return on investments and streamline our cost structure 
our main focus is on analog products and leveraging our analog strengths and r d spending on key growth markets utilizing analog products 
the main actions taken during the year were the closure of the cellular baseband business within our wireless business unit and the decision to sell our information appliance business unit  consisting primarily of the geodetm family of processor products 
the discussion below includes historical information which does not completely reflect our current strategic positioning and focus 
we recorded net sales of billion in fiscal this compares to billion in fiscal and billion in fiscal the increase in sales for fiscal over sales for fiscal came from higher demand  particularly from customers in our wireless handset market  one of our target markets  as business conditions for the semiconductor industry have slowly improved from a year ago  although general market and worldwide economic conditions have been essentially flat 
the decline in sales for fiscal from sales for fiscal came from lower demand seen broadly across semiconductor markets  as business conditions in the semiconductor industry remained weak throughout fiscal in contrast  market conditions were very strong in the first half of fiscal  but as we entered into the second half of fiscal  market conditions for the semiconductor industry quickly weakened 
in fiscal  we recorded a net loss of million 
this compares to a net loss of million in fiscal and net income of million in fiscal the improvement in our operating results for fiscal compared to fiscal was primarily driven by increased sales as business conditions for the semiconductor industry have slowly improved since last year 
our operating results for fiscal were primarily affected by lower sales caused by the overall economic slowdown experienced in fiscal the net loss for fiscal includes million of special items 
the special items include million for in process r d charges related to the acquisition in the second quarter of digitalquake see note to the consolidated financial statements and a net charge of million related to cost reduction actions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the cost reduction actions were taken as part of our strategic profit improvement actions 
the fiscal net loss also has million of charges included in r d expenses for the writedown of technology licenses see the research and development section below 
the net loss for fiscal included million of special items 
the special items included million for in process r d charges related to the acquisitions of fincitec oy  arsmikro ou and wireless solutions sweden ab see note to the consolidated financial statements 
special items also included a net charge of million related to cost reduction actions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income for fiscal included special items of million  which included million for in process r d charges related to acquisitions during the year see note to the consolidated financial statements and a million net charge for cost reduction actions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
o sales the following discussion includes comments pertaining to our reportable segments  which are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the increase in sales for fiscal over sales for fiscal came from higher unit volume throughout the year  up percent from the previous year 
this unit volume increase was partially offset by lower average selling prices that were down percent from the previous year  as we saw a shift in product mix toward lower priced products  combined with some price declines 
we are encouraged by the sales increase which occurred during an environment of overall flat economic conditions and the sars outbreak 
the analog segment  which represents percent of our total sales  experienced an increase in sales of percent for fiscal over sales for fiscal the increase came primarily from higher volume as unit shipments increased percent from last year 
however  average selling prices declined percent from last year  due to a shift in unit mix toward lower priced products and some modest price declines 
a significant portion of these lower priced products were a variety of high performance analog products offered in very small form factors  made possible by our advanced chip packaging technologies 
although these products may be relatively lower in price  their gross margins are relatively higher within our portfolio of products 
within the analog segment  sales of audio  power management and amplifier products increased in fiscal by percent  percent and percent  respectively  from sales in fiscal products for wireless handsets largely drove the sales growth in power management products 
sales of application specific wireless products  primarily radio frequency building blocks  were flat year on year 
sales for fiscal for the information appliance segment increased percent from sales for fiscal the increase came from a higher volume of geodetm integrated processor products and integrated dvd products that rose percent from the previous year 
average selling prices declined percent from last year for both geodetm and integrated dvd products 
the geodetm product family is the primary component of the information appliance business we are seeking to sell see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for fiscal  sales increased in all geographic regions compared to sales for fiscal the increases were percent in japan  percent in the asia pacific region  percent in europe and percent in the americas 
sales for fiscal as a percentage of total sales increased to percent for the asia pacific region and percent in japan  while decreasing to percent in the americas and percent in europe 
we have found that many of our customers have manufacturing operations in the asia pacific region that make their purchases in the asia pacific region  leading to sales increases in the asia pacific region with decreases in the americas and europe 
foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal were favorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the japanese yen  pound sterling and euro all strengthened against the dollar  but the impact on overall fiscal sales was minimal since less than a quarter of our total sales was denominated in foreign currency 
our sales for fiscal declined significantly from sales for fiscal  as market conditions for the semiconductor industry remained weak compared to fiscal although we saw a slight increase in unit volume in the second half of fiscal  the sales decline for the year was primarily due to the decreased shipment volume 
lower average selling prices were also a factor  as we saw a shift in product mix toward lower priced products and took some pricing actions to gain increased market share in target areas 
the analog segment  which represented percent of our total sales for fiscal  experienced a decline in sales of percent from sales for fiscal the decline in fiscal was due to a drop in unit volume together with decreases in average selling prices 
average selling prices were down due to shifts in product mix as well as some decline in prices  particularly on multisource products  which tend to be viewed as commodity products 
within the analog segment  sales of application specific wireless products  including radio frequency building blocks  declined in fiscal by percent from sales in fiscal in the broad based analog markets  sales of power management and amplifier products were also down in fiscal from sales in fiscal by percent and percent  respectively 
only sales of display products increased in fiscal those sales increased by percent over sales in fiscal  as a large increase in unit volume more than offset decreases in average selling prices 
sales for fiscal for the information appliances segment declined percent from sales for fiscal the decline was primarily driven by lower unit volume  as average selling prices increased slightly 
the year to year slowdown in demand for personal computers and pc related products was a significant cause of the decline in sales for the information appliance segment in fiscal since many of our information appliance products are used in the pc marketplace 
in addition  the market adoption of emerging information appliances that are not pcs was slower than expected 
for fiscal  sales declined in all geographic regions compared to sales for fiscal the decreases were percent in the americas  percent in europe  percent in japan and percent in the asia pacific region 
sales for fiscal as a percentage of total sales increased to percent for the asia pacific region  while decreasing to percent in the americas and percent in europe 
sales as a percentage of total sales held at percent in japan 
foreign currency denominated sales in fiscal were unfavorably affected by foreign currency exchange rate fluctuations as the japanese yen  pound sterling and euro all weakened against the dollar  but once again the impact from this was minimal since less than a quarter of our total sales for fiscal was denominated in foreign currency 
o gross margin gross margin as a percentage of sales was percent in fiscal compared to percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal the increase in gross margin for fiscal over fiscal was primarily driven by higher factory utilization 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization during fiscal was percent  compared to percent in fiscal when production activity was much lower due to weaker business conditions 
improvement in overall product mix and lower manufacturing costs in fiscal also offset an unfavorable impact on gross margin of actual price declines on selected products 
the decline in gross margin for fiscal from fiscal was primarily driven by lower factory utilization 
wafer fabrication capacity utilization during fiscal was percent  as production activity was reduced considerably by weakened business conditions 
this compares with wafer fabrication capacity utilization for fiscal of percent when business conditions were much stronger  particularly in the first half of the fiscal year 
we also saw lower margins from some products in fiscal  caused mostly by a shift in product sales mix and to a lesser extent by pricing pressure 
o research and development our research and development expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of sales  compared to million in fiscal  or percent of sales  and million in fiscal  or percent of sales 
these amounts exclude in process r d charges of million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal related to acquisitions see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the in process r d charges are separately included as a component of special items in the consolidated statements of operations 
r d expenses for fiscal also include million of charges for the writedown of technology licenses 
of this total  million came from the technology license with tsmc that was impaired when we restructured the agreement and entered into a new agreement to use tsmc as our supplier of wafers for products with feature sizes of micron and below 
in addition  we reached alternative arrangements with two other r d partners that led to the impairment of additional technology licenses for the remaining million charge 
excluding these charges  r d expenses for fiscal were lower by percent from r d expenses for fiscal the lower r d expenses reflect our effort to control the level of expenditures and prioritize spending toward more critical projects  as we focus our r d spending on analog products 
during fiscal  we devoted percent of our r d effort towards new product development and percent towards the development of process and support technology 
compared to fiscal  this represents a one percent increase in spending for new product development and an percent decrease in spending for process and support technology 
we continue to invest in the development of new analog and mixed signal technology based products for applications in the wireless handsets  displays  other portable devices and information infrastructure markets 
higher r d expenses in fiscal over fiscal resulted mainly from higher fees paid under the license agreement with tsmc that was subsequently restructured in fiscal the agreement  which began in fiscal  allowed us to gain access to a variety of tsmc s subsequently advanced sub micron processes if and when those processes were developed by tsmc  for use in our maine facility as we desired 
o selling  general and administrative our selling  general and administrative expenses in fiscal were million  or percent of sales  compared to million in fiscal  or percent of sales  and million in fiscal  or percent of sales 
the overall increase in sg a expenses for fiscal over expenses for fiscal was mainly due to higher payroll and employee benefit expenses 
the expenses for fiscal also reflect higher expenses from foreign currency remeasurement losses of million compared to a million net gain in fiscal the decline in sg a expenses for fiscal from the fiscal level reflects actions that we implemented in the second half of fiscal to reduce our spending in response to weakened business conditions  combined with our efforts to further control spending as business conditions remained weak throughout fiscal these actions reduced payroll and employee benefit expenses  as well as discretionary selling and marketing program expenses 
in addition  the fiscal sg a expenses included a million expense associated with a charitable donation of equity securities given to establish the national semiconductor foundation 
the fiscal sg a expenses also included goodwill amortization of million 
we no longer record goodwill amortization since adopting sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  at the beginning of fiscal o cost reduction programs and restructuring of operations for fiscal  we recorded charges of million related to the series of strategic profit improvement actions that we announced in february these actions  which were targeted at saving approximately million per quarter  are designed to streamline our cost structure and enhance shareholder value by prioritizing r d spending on higher margin analog businesses 
we also completed certain activities by the end of the fiscal year that reduced our estimate for an environmental liability for costs related to a prior exit action  which resulted in a credit of million 
the credit partially offset the charges for the fiscal cost reduction actions 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a more complete discussion of these actions and related charges  as well as a discussion of activity during fiscal related to previously announced actions 
o charge for acquired in process research and development in connection with our acquisition during fiscal of digitalquake  inc  we allocated million of the total purchase price to the value of in process r d 
in connection with our acquisitions during fiscal of the combined companies of fincitec oy and arsmikro ou  and separately of wireless solutions sweden ab  million and million of the total purchase price for each acquisition were respectively allocated to the value of in process r d 
in connection with our acquisitions during fiscal of vivid semiconductor and innocomm wireless  million and million of the total purchase price for each acquisition were respectively allocated to the value of in process r d 
these amounts were expensed upon acquisition because technological feasibility had not been established and no alternative uses existed for the technologies 
for more specific information on each acquisition  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
for each acquisition  the fair value of the in process r d was based on discounted projected net cash flows expected to be derived after successful completion of existing r d projects 
estimates of future cash flows from revenues were based primarily on market growth assumptions  lives of underlying technologies and our expected share of the estimated total market 
gross profit projections were based on our experience with products that were similar in nature or products sold into markets with similar characteristics 
estimated operating expenses  income taxes and capital charges were deducted from gross profit to determine net operating income for the in process r d projects 
operating expenses were estimated as a percentage of revenue and included sales and marketing expenses and development costs to maintain the technology once it has achieved technological feasibility 
we discounted the net cash flows of the in process r d projects using probable adjusted discount rates that approximated the overall rate of return for each acquisition as a whole and reflected the inherent uncertainties surrounding the development of in process r d projects 
o interest income and interest expense for fiscal  we earned net interest income of million compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in net interest income for fiscal was due to lower average interest rates on higher average cash balances during fiscal compared to fiscal offsetting interest expense was slightly lower for fiscal as we continued to reduce our outstanding debt balances 
the decrease in net interest income for fiscal compared to fiscal was due to lower average interest rates on lower average cash balances during fiscal compared to fiscal offsetting interest expense was slightly lower for fiscal as we reduced our outstanding debt balances 
o other income expense  net we recorded other expense  net of million for fiscal and other income  net of million for fiscal and million for fiscal the components of other expense  net for fiscal included million of net intellectual property income  which was offset by a million charge for our share in net losses of equity method investments  a million net loss from other investments  and million from other miscellaneous losses 
net intellectual property income for fiscal included million from a single significant licensing agreement with a north american company and the remainder from a number of individually small agreements 
the components of other income  net for fiscal included million of net intellectual property income  a million net gain from investments  a million charge for our share in net losses of equity method investments and million from other miscellaneous losses 
net intellectual property income for fiscal included a gain of million from the settlement of a patent infringement lawsuit 
the remaining intellectual property income was from a number of individually small agreements 
other income  net for fiscal included a million net gain from investments  million of net intellectual property income  a million charge for our share in net losses of equity method investment and million from other miscellaneous losses 
the net gain from investments for fiscal included a gain of million from the distribution of equity securities that were part of our investment portfolio  which we donated to establish the national semiconductor foundation 
an expense for the same amount associated with the donation was included in sg a expenses for fiscal net intellectual property income for fiscal included million from a single significant licensing agreement with a korean company and the remainder from a number of individually small agreements 
o income tax expense we recorded an income tax expense of million in fiscal  compared to an income tax benefit of million in fiscal and income tax expense of million in fiscal the fiscal tax expense represents non us income taxes on international income 
we did not incur us income taxes 
the fiscal tax benefit consisted of million expected refund of us taxes as a result of the new federal tax act  which was mostly offset by million of tax expenses on international income 
our ability to realize net deferred tax assets million at may  is primarily dependent on our ability to generate future us taxable income 
we believe that it is more likely than not we should be able to generate sufficient taxable income in the us to utilize these tax assets  but it is possible that we will be unable to do so and therefore unable to realize the benefits of recognized tax assets 
this could result in future charges to increase the deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
o foreign operations our foreign operations include manufacturing facilities in the asia pacific region and europe and sales offices throughout the asia pacific region  europe and japan 
a portion of the transactions at these facilities is denominated in local currency  which exposes us to risk from exchange rate fluctuations 
our exposure from expenses at foreign manufacturing facilities is concentrated in pound sterling  singapore dollar and malaysian ringgit 
where practical  we hedge net non us dollar denominated asset and liability positions using forward exchange and purchased option contracts 
our exposure from foreign currency denominated revenue is limited to the japanese yen and the euro 
we hedge up to percent of the notional value of outstanding customer orders denominated in foreign currency  using forward exchange contracts and over the counter foreign currency options 
a portion of anticipated foreign sales commitments is  at times  hedged using purchased option contracts that have an original maturity of one year or less 
at certain of our international locations  we maintain defined benefit pension plans that are operated in accordance with local statutes and practices 
we record an adjustment for minimum pension liability to adjust the liability related to one of our plans to equal the amount of the unfunded accumulated benefit obligation as required by the pension accounting standards 
for fiscal  the adjustment we recorded was million 
a corresponding amount is recorded in the consolidated financial statements as a component of accumulated other comprehensive loss 
this increased the unfunded benefit obligation from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the major cause of this growth was an increase in the accumulated benefit obligation due to a reduction in the assumed discount rate and the effect of some fixed rate increases in benefits in excess of current inflation rates as determined under the terms of the plan 
concurrently  lower than expected rate of return on plan assets due to a decline in interest rates and investment returns in the past few years also reduced plan assets 
as we have done in the past  we will continue to fund the plan in the future to adequately meet the minimum funding requirements under local statutes 
o financial market risks we are exposed to financial market risks  including changes in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
to mitigate these risks  we use derivative financial instruments 
we do not use derivative financial instruments for speculative or trading purposes 
due to the short term nature of the major portion of our cash portfolio  a series of severe cuts in interest rates  such as those recently experienced  does have a significant impact on the amount of interest income we earn from our cash portfolio 
an increase in interest rates benefits us due to our large net cash position 
an increase in interest rates would not necessarily immediately increase interest expense due to the fixed rates of our existing debt obligations 
a substantial majority of our revenue and capital spending is transacted in us dollars 
however  we enter into transactions in other currencies  primarily the japanese yen  euro and certain other asian currencies 
to protect against reductions in value and the volatility of future cash flows caused by changes in foreign exchange rates  we have established programs to hedge our exposure to these changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our hedging programs reduce  but do not always eliminate  the impact of foreign currency exchange rate movements 
an adverse change defined as percent in all currencies in exchange rates would result in a decline in income before taxes of less than million 
this calculation assumes that each exchange rate would change in the same direction relative to the us dollar 
in addition to the direct effects of changes in exchange rates  these changes typically affect the volume of sales or the foreign currency sales price as competitors products become more or less attractive 
our sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates does not factor in a potential change in sales levels or local currency selling prices 
all of the potential changes noted above are based on sensitivity analyses performed on our balances as of may  o liquidity and capital resources as of may   cash  cash equivalents and short term marketable investments were million  up from million at may  cash and cash equivalents increased million in fiscal compared to a decrease of million in fiscal and an increase of million in fiscal the primary factors contributing to these changes are described below we generated cash from operating activities of million during fiscal compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal for fiscal  cash was generated from operating activities because the positive impact from the net loss  after adjusting for noncash items primarily depreciation and amortization  more than offset the negative impact that came from changes in working capital components 
the negative changes from working capital components for fiscal came primarily from decreases in accounts payable and accrued expenses 
for fiscal  operating cash was generated because the noncash components of our net loss  primarily depreciation and amortization  were greater than the reported net loss and the negative impact from changes in working capital components 
for fiscal  operating cash was generated primarily from net income adjusted for noncash expenses  which was partially offset by the negative impact from changes in working capital components 
our investing activities used cash of million in fiscal  compared to million used in fiscal and million used in fiscal major uses of cash in fiscal included the acquisition of digitalquake for million  net of cash received see note to the consolidated financial statements and investment in property  plant and equipment of million  primarily for machinery and equipment  and cad software licenses  which were offset by the net sale and maturity of available for sale securities of million 
major uses of cash in fiscal included investment in property  plant and equipment of million  net purchases of available for sale securities of million and the acquisitions of fincitec oy  arsmikro ou and wireless solutions sweden ab for a total of million  net of cash acquired see note to the consolidated financial statements 
major uses of cash in fiscal included investment in property  plant and equipment of million and the acquisitions of innocomm and vivid for a total of million  net of cash acquired see note to the consolidated financial statements 
our financing activities generated cash of million for fiscal and million in fiscal  while they used cash of million in fiscal the primary source of cash in fiscal came from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans in the amount of million  which was partially offset by the repayment of million of our outstanding debt balances 
the primary source of cash in fiscal was from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans in the amount of million  which was partially offset by repayment of million of our outstanding debt balances 
the primary use of cash in fiscal was for our repurchase of million shares of common stock on the open market for million 
all of these shares were retired during fiscal this more than offset cash inflow of million from the issuance of common stock under employee benefit plans 
we foresee continuing cash outlays for plant and equipment going into the first half of fiscal  with our primary focus on new capabilities that support our target growth markets  as well as improvements to provide more capacity in selected areas and improved manufacturing efficiency and productivity 
during fiscal  we began construction of an assembly and test facility in china to expand our business presence in the asia markets 
we currently expect our fiscal capital expenditure amount to be similar to the fiscal amount 
however  we will continue to manage capital expenditures in light of business conditions 
we expect existing cash and investment balances  together with existing lines of credit  to be sufficient to finance planned capital investments in fiscal our cash and investment balances are dependent on continued collection of customer receivables and the ability to sell inventories 
although we have not experienced major problems with our customer receivables  significant declines in overall economic conditions could lead to deterioration in the quality of customer receivables 
in addition  major declines in financial markets would likely cause reductions in our cash equivalents and marketable investments

o outlook although overall economic conditions remain flat and uncertain  demand levels in fiscal were better as business conditions in the semiconductor industry slowly improved from a year ago 
we experienced sequential quarterly growth in new orders during the second half of fiscal  especially for our analog segment where orders for power management  amplifier and audio products experienced the greatest increases 
while new orders grew overall in the just completed fourth quarter  we saw delivery dates for orders placed by customers begin to extend further out in time 
as we finished the fiscal year  we also saw a drop in the weekly run rate of total orders and turns orders  which are orders received with delivery requested in the same quarter 
as a result  our opening week backlog entering the first quarter of fiscal was slightly lower than it was at the beginning of the fiscal fourth quarter 
historically  sales in our first quarter have been down from the preceding fourth quarter due to the summer vacation season 
turns orders are typically lower during a portion of the summer season when our customers have lower production activities 
based on these seasonal factors  we anticipate that sales for the first quarter of fiscal will be flat to down by percent from the fiscal fourth quarter 
if the level of turns orders is not achieved or the rate of new orders declines  we may not be able to achieve the level of sales expected for the first quarter of fiscal we also expect gross margin percentage to be flat to slightly down from gross margin achieved in the recent fourth quarter  depending on the sales level 
we believe we have the ability to quickly adjust the level of production activity in our manufacturing facilities to align with changes in order levels and economic conditions during the quarter  if necessary 
however  the mix of available product may not exactly match the mix of product requested on a short term basis 
since we first launched the series of profit improvement actions back in february designed to improve our return on investments and streamline our cost structure  we have achieved some significant savings in our future operating expenses 
to date  we have restructured our technology licensing agreement with tsmc  essentially eliminating the quarterly fees we were paying to have access to tsmc s advanced sub micron processes for use in our maine facility 
we also announced the closure of the cellular baseband business in may and reduced our worldwide workforce by positions by the end of the fiscal year 
so far  these actions are expected to result in a savings of approximately million per quarter  most of which will be reflected in reduction in our r d expenses 
accordingly  we expect r d expenses in the first quarter of fiscal to be in the range of million  with sg a expenses in the range of million 
as a part of the plan  we announced we would seek to sell the information appliance business  primarily consisting of the geodetm family of products  and we are actively pursuing a sale of that business  which we expect to complete by the end of the first quarter of fiscal if we are unable to sell the business  we will close the business unit 
sale or closure of the business unit is expected to provide additional savings 
in the meantime we will continue to incur expenses associated with supporting the business and its customers 
o risk factors conditions inherent in the semiconductor industry cause periodic fluctuations in our operating results 
rapid technological change and frequent introduction of new technology leading to more complex and more integrated products characterize the semiconductor industry 
the result is a cyclical environment with short product life cycles  price erosion and high sensitivity to the overall business cycle 
substantial capital and r d investment are also required to support products and manufacturing processes 
as a result of these industry conditions  we have experienced in the past and expect to experience in the future periodic fluctuations in our operating results 
shifts in product mix toward  or away from  higher margin products can also have a significant impact on our operating results 
as a result of these and other factors  our financial results can fluctuate significantly from period to period 
our business will be harmed if we are unable to compete successfully in our markets 
competition in the semiconductor industry is intense 
we compete with a number of major corporations in the high volume segment of the industry 
these include several multinational companies whose semiconductor business may be only part of their overall operations  such as koninklijke royal philips electronics  matsushita  motorola  nec  samsung and toshiba 
we also compete with a large number of corporations such as texas instruments  st microelectronics  maxim  analog devices and linear technology that sell competing products into some of the same markets that we target 
competition is based on design and quality of products  product performance  price and service  with the relative importance of these factors varying among products and markets 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully in the future against existing or new competitors or that our operating results will not be adversely affected by increased price competition 
we may also compete with several of our customers  particularly customers in the networking and personal systems markets 
the wireless handset market continues to be important to our future growth plans 
new products are being developed to address new features and functionality in handsets  such as color displays  advanced audio  lighting features and image capture 
due to high levels of competition  as well as complex technological requirements  there is no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in this targeted market 
although the worldwide handset market is large  near term growth trends are highly uncertain and difficult to predict with accuracy 
delayed introduction of next generation wireless base stations also negatively impacts potential growth in the wireless handset market 
if development of new products is delayed or market acceptance is below expectations  future operating results may be unfavorably affected 
we believe that continued focused investment in research and development  especially the timely development and market acceptance of new analog products  is a key factor to our successful growth and our ability to achieve strong financial performance 
successful development and introduction of new products are critical to our ability to maintain a competitive position in the marketplace 
we will continue to invest resources to develop more highly integrated solutions and building block products  both primarily based on our analog capabilities 
these products will continue to be targeted towards application in the wireless handsets  displays  other portable devices and information infrastructure markets 
acquisitions 
we have made and will continue to consider making strategic business investments and alliances and acquisitions  if necessary  to gain access to key technologies that we believe augment our existing technical capability or enable us to achieve faster time to market 
acquisitions and investments involve risks and uncertainties that may unfavorably impact our future financial performance 
we may not be able to integrate and develop the technologies we acquire as expected 
if the technology is not developed in a timely manner  we may be unsuccessful in penetrating target markets 
in addition  with any acquisition there are risks that future operating results may be unfavorably affected by acquisition related costs  including in process r d charges and incremental r d spending 
expansion of our business in the asia markets 
as noted in our discussion of planned capital expenditures  as part of our efforts to expand our business presence in the asia markets  we began construction of an assembly and test facility in china s suzhou industrial park in the jiangsu province of china during the second quarter of fiscal the facility is expected to provide analog products quickly and cost effectively to our customers in china  as well as other regions as necessary 
the facility also will increase our overall assembly and test capacity to support increasing product volume 
increases in product volume are dependent upon demand from our customers 
if we do not increase product volume  lower than expected factory utilization  which results in higher manufacturing cost per unit  will unfavorably impact operating results 
in addition  unexpected start up expenses  inefficiencies and delays in the start of production in the facility may reduce our expected future gross margin 
we face risks from our international operations  many of which are beyond our control 
we conduct a substantial portion of our operations outside the united states  and our business is subject to risks associated with many factors beyond our control 
these factors include fluctuations in foreign currency rates  instability of foreign economies  emerging infrastructures in foreign markets  support required abroad for demanding manufacturing requirements  foreign government instability and changes  and us and foreign laws and policies affecting trade and investment 
although we did not experience any materially adverse effects from our foreign operations as a result of these factors in the last year  one or more of these factors has had an adverse effect on us in the past and they could adversely affect us in the future 
in addition  although we seek to hedge our exposure to currency exchange rate fluctuations  our competitive position relative to non us suppliers can be affected by the exchange rate of the non us dollar against other currencies  particularly the japanese yen and euro 
taxes 
from time to time  we have received notices of tax assessments from certain governments of countries in which we operate 
the irs is in the process of examining our tax returns for fiscal through we are also undergoing a tax audit in the netherlands 
these governments or other government entities may serve future notices of assessments on us and the amounts of these assessments or our failure to favorably resolve such assessments may have a material adverse effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
current world events 
recent unrest in the many parts of the world including the war in iraq and terrorist activities worldwide have resulted in additional uncertainty on the overall state of the world economy 
there is no assurance that the consequences from these events will not disrupt our operations either in the us or other regions of the world where we have operations 
the outbreak of the sars illness could also adversely affect our business in asia if it does not continue to be contained 
if there is a significant spread of sars beyond asia  other aspects of our operations could be negatively impacted
