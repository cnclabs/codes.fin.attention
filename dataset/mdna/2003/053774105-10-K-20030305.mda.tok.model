we seek organic growth in revenues and earnings by serving our customers  applying our core competencies and managing our discretionary spending with a focus on return on investment 
such growth is expected to be augmented by  on a select basis  the acquisition and integration of complementary businesses  the purchase price of which we intend to pay with cash generated by our core operations throughout we also routinely review and evaluate our portfolio of existing businesses to determine if they continue to meet our current objectives and  from time to time  engage in discussions concerning possible divestitures  joint ventures and related corporate transactions 
during  we completed a number of such transactions  as discussed below 
acquisitions on april   we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of nrt incorporated  the largest residential real estate brokerage firm in the united states  for million  including million of estimated transaction costs and expenses and million related to the conversion of nrt employee stock appreciation rights to cd common stock options 
the acquisition consideration was funded through an exchange of million shares of cd common stock then valued at million  which included approximately million shares of cd common stock then valued at million in exchange for existing nrt options 
as part of the acquisition  we also assumed approximately million of nrt debt  which was subsequently repaid 
prior to the acquisition  nrt operated as a joint venture between us and apollo management  lp that acquired independent real estate brokerages  converted them to one of our real estate franchise brands and operated under the brand pursuant to two year agreements 
management believes that as a wholly owned subsidiary  nrt will be a more efficient acquisition vehicle and achieve greater financial and operational synergies 
nrt is a component of the real estate services segment 
on april   we acquired approximately of the outstanding common stock of trendwest resorts  inc for million in our cd common stock approximately million shares plus million of estimated transaction costs and expenses and million related to the conversion of trendwest employee stock options into cd common stock options 
as part of the acquisition  we assumed million of trendwest debt  of which million was subsequently repaid 
we purchased the remaining of the outstanding trendwest shares in a merger on june  for approximately million shares of our cd common stock aggregating million 
trendwest markets  sells and finances vacation ownership interests 
management believes that this acquisition will provide us with significant geographic diversification and global presence in the timeshare industry 
trendwest is now a component of our hospitality segment 
on november   we acquired substantially all of the domestic assets of the vehicle rental business of budget group  inc  as well as selected international operations  for approximately million in cash plus million of transaction costs and expenses 
as part of the acquisition  we also assumed approximately billion of budget s asset backed vehicle related debt  which was repaid with the proceeds from our subsequent issuance of billion of asset backed debt and approximately million of borrowings under our billion revolving credit facility 
management believes that budget is a complementary fit with the other leisure travel services we provide through our hotel  timeshare  and travel distribution companies 
budget is now a component of our vehicle services segment 
subsequent to our acquisition of nrt  we acquired other residential real estate brokerage operations through nrt for approximately million  including arvida realty services for approximately million and the dewolfe companies for approximately million 
the acquisition of real estate brokerages by nrt is a core part of its growth strategy 
we also acquired other non significant businesses during for aggregate consideration of approximately million in cash  including i equivest finance  inc  a timeshare developer  for approximately million  ii three european distribution partners of our galileo subsidiary for approximately million  iii novasol as  a marketer of privately owned vacation properties in europe  for approximately million and iv other businesses for approximately million primarily within our hospitality and travel distribution segments 
none of these acquisitions were significant to our results of operations or financial position individually or in the aggregate 
the following table summarizes the preliminary estimated fair values of net assets acquired and resultant goodwill recognized in connection with the above acquisitions assets acquired liabilities assumed net assets acquired goodwill nrt     trendwest  budget   other   the goodwill resulting from the preliminary allocations of the purchase prices of these businesses aggregated million  of which million  million  million  million and million was allocated to the real estate services  hospitality  travel distribution  vehicle services and financial services segments  respectively 
the results of operations of businesses we acquired have been included in our consolidated results of operations since their respective dates of acquisition 
in certain circumstances  the allocations of the excess purchase price are based upon preliminary estimates and assumptions 
accordingly  the allocations are subject to revision when we receive final information  including appraisals  and other analyses 
revisions to the fair values  which may be significant  will be recorded as further adjustments to the purchase price allocations 
we are also in the process of integrating the operations of all our acquired businesses and expect to incur costs relating to such integrations 
these costs may result from integrating operating systems  relocating employees  closing facilities  reducing duplicative efforts and exiting and consolidating other activities 
these costs will be recorded on our consolidated balance sheets as adjustments to the purchase price or on our consolidated statements of income as expenses  as appropriate 
for more detailed information regarding the budget  nrt and trendwest acquisitions  see note acquisitions to our consolidated financial statements 
dispositions on may   we sold our ncp subsidiary for approximately billion in cash 
ncp operated car parking facilities within the united kingdom and was a part of our vehicle services segment 
we recorded an after tax loss of approximately million in the second quarter of on the sale of this business principally related to foreign currency translation  as a result of the strengthening of the us dollar against the us pound since our acquisition of ncp in through the date of disposition 
such loss was recorded within the loss on disposal of discontinued operations  net of tax  line item 
the account balances and activities of ncp have been segregated and reported as a discontinued operation for all periods presented herein  as required by generally accepted accounting principles 
critical accounting policies in presenting our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported therein 
several of the estimates and assumptions we are required to make relate to matters that are inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
however  events that are outside of our control cannot be predicted and  as such  they cannot be contemplated in evaluating such estimates and assumptions 
if there is a significant unfavorable change to current conditions  it will likely result in a material adverse impact to our consolidated results of operations  financial position and liquidity 
we believe that the estimates and assumptions we used when preparing our financial statements were the most appropriate at that time 
presented below are those accounting policies that we believe require subjective and complex judgments that could potentially affect reported results 
however  the majority of our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for a service performed  and therefore the results of the majority of our recurring operations are recorded in our financial statements using accounting policies that are not particularly subjective  nor complex 
mortgage servicing rights 
a mortgage servicing right msr is the right to receive a portion of the interest coupon and fees collected from the mortgagor for performing specified mortgage servicing activities 
the value of mortgage servicing rights is estimated based upon an internal valuation that reflects management s estimates of expected future cash flows considering prepayment estimates developed using a third party model described below  our historical prepayment rates  portfolio characteristics  interest rates based on interest rate yield curves and other economic factors 
more specifically  we incorporate an option adjusted spread oas model to generate and discount cash flows for the msr valuation 
the oas model generates numerous interest rate paths then calculates the msr cash flow at each monthly point for each interest rate path and discounts those cash flows back to the current period 
the msr value is determined by averaging the discounted cash flows from each of the interest rate paths 
the interest rate paths are generated with a random distribution centered around implied forward interest rates which are determined from the interest rate yield curve at any given point of time 
as of december   the implied forward interest rates project an increase of approximately basis points in the yield of the year treasury note over the next months 
changes in the yield curve will result in changes to the forward rates implied from that yield curve 
as noted above  a key assumption in our estimate of the msr valuation are forecasted prepayments 
we use a third party model  adjusted to reflect the historical prepayment behavior exhibited by our portfolio  to forecast prepayment rates at each monthly point for each interest rate path in the oas model 
the prepayment forecast is based on historical observations of prepayment behavior in similar periods of refinance incentive 
the prepayment forecast incorporates loan characteristics eg  loan type and note rate and factors such as recent prepayment experience  previous refinance opportunities and estimated levels of home equity to determine the prepayment forecast at each monthly point for each interest rate path 
to the extent that fair value is less than carrying value  we would consider the portfolio to have been impaired and record a related charge 
reductions in interest rates different than those predicted in our models could cause us to use different assumptions in the msr valuation  which could result in a decrease in the estimated fair value of our msr asset  requiring a corresponding reduction in the carrying value of the asset 
to mitigate this risk  we use derivatives that generally increase in value as interest rates decline and conversely decline in value as interest rates increase 
additionally  as interest rates are reduced  we have historically experienced a greater level of refinancings  which has historically mitigated the impact on earnings of the decline in our msr asset 
changes in the estimated fair value of the mortgage servicing rights based upon variations in the assumptions eg  future interest rate levels  prepayment speeds cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
changes in one assumption may result in changes to another  which may magnify or counteract the fair value sensitivity analysis and would make such an analysis not meaningful 
additionally  further declines in interest rates due to a weakening economy and geopolitical risks  which result in an increase in refinancing activity or change in the methodology of valuing our msr asset  could adversely impact the valuation 
the carrying value of our msr asset was approximately billion as of december  and the total portfolio that we were servicing approximated billion as of december  refer to note mortgage servicing activities to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion of the effect of any changes to the value of this asset during and 
the effects of any adverse potential changes in the estimated fair value of our msr asset are detailed in note transfers and servicing of financial assets to our consolidated financial statements 
retained interests from securitizations 
we sell a significant portion of our residential mortgage loans and relocation and timeshare receivables as part of our overall financing and liquidity strategy 
we retain the servicing rights and  in some instances  subordinated residual interests in the mortgage loans and relocation and timeshare receivables 
with the exception of specific mortgage loans that are sold with recourse  the investors have no recourse to our other assets for failure of debtors to pay when due 
gains or losses relating to the assets securitized are allocated between such assets and the retained interests based on their relative fair values on the date of sale 
we estimate fair value of the retained interests based upon the present value of expected future cash flows  which is subject to the prepayment risks  expected credit losses and interest rate risks of the sold financial assets 
changes in the estimated fair value of the retained interests based upon variations in the assumptions eg  prepayment risks  expected credit losses and interest rate risks cannot be extrapolated because the relationship of the change in assumption to the change in fair value may not be linear 
changes in one assumption may result in changes to another  which may magnify or counteract the fair value sensitivity analysis and would make such an analysis not meaningful 
the carrying value of our retained interests was approximately billion at december   of which approximately billion represented our mortgage servicing rights asset that was retained upon the sale of the underlying mortgage loans  as described above under mortgage servicing rights 
the effects of any adverse potential changes in the estimated fair value of our retained interests are detailed in note transfers and servicing of financial assets to our consolidated financial statements 
financial instruments 
we estimate fair values for each of our financial instruments  including derivative instruments 
most of these financial instruments are not publicly traded on an organized exchange 
in the absence of quoted market prices  we must develop an estimate of fair value using dealer quotes  present value cash flow models  option pricing models or other conventional valuation methods  as appropriate 
the use of these fair value techniques involves significant judgments and assumptions  including estimates of future interest rate levels based on interest rate yield curves  prepayment and volatility factors  and an estimation of the timing of future cash flows 
the use of different assumptions may have a material effect on the estimated fair value amounts recorded in the financial statements  which are disclosed in note financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
in addition  hedge accounting requires that at the beginning of each hedge period  we justify an expectation that the relationship between the changes in fair value of derivatives designated as hedges compared to changes in the fair value of the underlying hedged items be highly effective 
this effectiveness assessment involves an estimation of changes in fair value resulting from changes in interest rates and corresponding changes in prepayment levels  as well as the probability of the occurrence of transactions for cash flow hedges 
the use of different assumptions and changing market conditions may impact the results of the effectiveness assessment and ultimately the timing of when changes in derivative fair values and the underlying hedged items are recorded in earnings 
see item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for a discussion of the effect of hypothetical changes to these assumptions 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
we have reviewed the carrying values of our goodwill and other intangible assets as required by statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  by comparing the carrying values of our reporting units to their fair values and determined that the carrying amounts of our reporting units did not exceed their respective fair values 
when determining fair value  we utilized various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the respective carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a charge  which would impact earnings 
we will continue to review the carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets for impairment annually  or more frequently if circumstances indicate impairment may have occurred 
we provide a wide range of consumer and business services and  as a result  our goodwill and other intangible assets are allocated among many diverse reporting units 
accordingly  it is difficult to quantify the impact of an adverse change in financial results and related cash flows  as such change may be isolated to a small number of our reporting units or spread across our entire organization 
in either case  the magnitude of an impairment of such assets  if any  cannot be extrapolated 
however  our businesses are concentrated in a few industries and  as such  an adverse change to any of these industries will impact our consolidated results and may result in impairment of our goodwill and other intangible assets 
the aggregate carrying value of our goodwill and other intangible assets was approximately billion at december   of which billion represented goodwill  billion represented other indefinite lived intangible assets and billion represented intangible assets with finite lives refer to note intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements for more information on goodwill and other intangible assets 
results of operations vs 
our consolidated results from continuing operations comprised the following change net revenues    expenses  excluding other charges and non program related interest  net other charges non program related interest  net total expenses    gains on dispositions of businesses losses on dispositions of businesses impairment of investments income before income taxes  minority interest and equity in homestore provision for income taxes minority interest  net of tax losses related to equity in homestore  net of tax income from continuing operations  net revenues and total expenses increased billion and billion  respectively  during primarily due to the acquisitions of the following businesses  which contributed incremental revenues and expenses aggregating billion and billion  respectively acquired business date of acquisition incremental contribution to net revenues incremental contribution to total expenses avis group holdings  inc march fairfield resorts  inc april galileo international  inc october  nrt april   a trendwest april b budget november total contributions   a excludes million of non cash amortization of the pendings and listings intangible asset and million of acquisition and integration related costs 
b excludes million of non cash amortization of the pendings and listings intangible asset and million of acquisition and integration related costs 
in addition to the contributions made by acquired businesses  net revenues were favorably impacted by growth in our real estate services and vehicle services segments exclusive of acquisitions

b the and charges were incurred in connection with settlements or investigations relating to the discovery of accounting irregularities in the former business units of cuc international  inc the charge was partially offset by a credit of million related to the recovery under our directors and officers liability insurance policy in connection with derivative actions arising from former cuc related litigation  while the charge was partially offset by a non cash credit of million to reflect an adjustment to the prides class action litigation settlement charge recorded by the company in c the amount represents non cash credits related to changes in the original estimates of costs to be incurred in connection with our restructuring initiatives undertaken during as a result of the september  terrorist attacks 
the amount primarily represents charges related to i the restructuring initiatives undertaken in response to the september  terrorist attacks million  ii the funding of an irrevocable contribution to the real estate technology trust million  iii the funding of trip network  inc million and iv a contribution to the cendant charitable foundation million 
the activity and ending balance of the restructuring accrual can be found in note other charges credits to our consolidated financial statements 
d the charge was incurred in connection with unprecedented rate reductions subsequent to the september  terrorist attacks that we deemed not to be in the ordinary course of business 
the impairments were recorded as reductions to net revenues 
e see note other charges credits to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of each charge 
additionally  our operating results were impacted by gains and losses related to the dispositions of businesses  as well as by losses related to the impairment of investments  while our results were not impacted by such events 
during  these events resulted in i million of gains primarily related to the sale of our real estate internet portal million  ii million of losses related to the dispositions of non strategic businesses and iii million of losses related to the impairment of our investments in homestore  inc million and lodging and internet related businesses million 
our overall effective tax rate was and for and  respectively 
the effective rate for was higher from the negative impact of a reduction in the amount of foreign tax credits and state net operating losses that were utilized  which was only partially offset by the benefit from the impact on the tax provision from the elimination of goodwill amortization 
our operating results were also negatively impacted by after tax losses of million related to our equity ownership in homestore  which was received in connection with the sale of our internet real estate portal to homestore in february our investment in homestore has been recorded at zero since fourth quarter and  as such  we are no longer required by generally accepted accounting principles to record a proportionate share of homestore s losses 
therefore  during  our operating results were not impacted by our investment in homestore 
we have no future obligations relating to our investment in homestore 
for a detailed discussion regarding the sale of our real estate internet portal and our investment in homestore  refer to notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
as a result of the above mentioned items  income from continuing operations increased million  or  during discussed below are the operating results for each of our segments  which focuses on revenues and adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before non program related interest  income taxes  non program related depreciation and amortization  minority interest and  in  equity in homestore 
such measure is then adjusted to exclude items that are of a non recurring or unusual nature and are also not measured in assessing segment performance 
in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  our management believes such discussions are the most informative representation of how management evaluates performance 
however  our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies 
the footnotes to the table presented below describe the items that have been excluded from adjusted ebitda 
revenues adjusted ebitda change a b change real estate services c   hospitality d   travel distribution e  vehicle services f   financial services   total reportable segments     corporate and other g total company     less non program related depreciation and amortization less other charges acquisition and integration related costs litigation and related costs restructuring and other unusual charges mortgage servicing rights impairment less non program related interest  net plus gains on dispositions of businesses less losses on dispositions of businesses less impairment of investments income before income taxes  minority interest and equity in homestore not meaningful 
a adjusted ebitda excludes non cash credits of million related to changes in the original estimates of costs to be incurred in connection with restructuring initiatives undertaken during as a result of the september  terrorist attacks million  million and million of credits were recorded within real estate services  vehicle services and corporate and other  respectively

g represents the results of operations of our non strategic businesses  unallocated corporate overhead and the elimination of transactions between segments 
adjusted ebitda for excludes million of litigation and related costs and million of acquisition and integration related costs 
such charges were partially offset by a credit of million related to the recovery under our directors and officers liability insurance policy in connection with derivative actions arising from former cuc related litigation 
adjusted ebitda for excludes charges of i million primarily related to the impairment of our investment in homestore  ii million for litigation and related costs  iii million related to the funding of trip network  iv million related to the outsourcing of our information technology operations to ibm in connection with the acquisition of galileo  v million related to losses on the dispositions of non strategic businesses in  vi million related to a non cash contribution to the cendant charitable foundation and vii million related to the acquisition and integration of avis 
such charges were partially offset by i a gain of million related to the sale of our real estate internet portal  ii a gain of million related to the dispositions of non strategic businesses and iii a credit of million to reflect an adjustment to the settlement charge recorded in the fourth quarter of for the prides class action litigation 
real estate services revenues increased billion while adjusted ebitda declined million during the increase in revenues was principally driven by the contribution of approximately billion in revenues from the acquisition of nrt the operating results of which have been included in our consolidated results since april  
the nrt acquisition also contributed million to adjusted ebitda during prior to our acquisition of nrt  we received royalty and marketing fees of million  real estate referral fees of million and termination fees of million from nrt during for the period from january  through april   nrt paid us royalty and marketing fees of million  real estate referral fees of million and a termination fee of million 
we also had a preferred stock investment in nrt prior to our acquisition that generated dividend income of million and million during and  respectively 
on a comparable basis  including post acquisition intercompany royalties paid by nrt  our real estate franchise brands generated incremental royalties of million in  an increase of over the increase in royalties from our real estate franchise brands primarily resulted from a increase in home sale transactions by franchisees and nrt  and a increase in the average price of homes sold 
royalty increases in the real estate franchise business are recognized with little or no corresponding increase in expenses due to the significant operating leverage within our franchise operations 
industry statistics provided by the national association of realtors for the twelve months ended december  indicate that the number of single family homes sold increased versus the prior year  while the average price of those homes sold increased approximately 
through our continued franchise sales efforts  we have grown our franchised operations and in conjunction with nrt acquisitions of real estate brokerages  we have increased market share as our transaction volume has significantly outperformed the industry 
revenues and adjusted ebitda in were negatively impacted by a million non cash provision for impairment of our mortgage servicing rights msr asset  which is the value of expected future cash flows 
as noted above in critical accounting policies  the valuation of our msr asset is generated by numerous estimates and assumptions  the most noteworthy being future prepayment rates  which represent the borrowers propensity to refinance their mortgage 
today s mortgage industry enables homeowners to more easily refinance than they could in the past producing a change in consumer behavior that results in a greater likelihood to refinance in periods of declining interest rates  as experienced in the third quarter of during such period  interest rates on ten year treasury notes and year mortgages declined by basis points and basis points  respectively  which resulted in the lowest interest rate levels in years 
as a result  we recognized that steep declines in interest rates experienced throughout the quarter and the related impact on current borrower prepayment behavior necessitated an increase to our estimate of future prepayment rates 
therefore  we updated the third party model we use to value our msr asset to one that had recently become available in the marketplace  and revised our assumptions in order to better reflect more current borrower prepayment behavior 
the combination of these factors resulted in increases to our estimated future loan prepayment rates  which negatively impacted the value of our msr asset  hence requiring the provision for impairment of our msr asset 
further declines in interest rates due to a weakening economy and geopolitical risks  which result in an increase in refinancing activity or changes in the methodology of valuing our msr asset  could adversely impact the valuation 
excluding the million non cash provision for impairment of msrs  revenues from mortgage related activities increased million in compared with as revenue growth from mortgage production was principally offset by a decline in net revenues from mortgage servicing activities 
revenues from mortgage loan production increased million in compared with the prior year due to substantial growth in our outsourced mortgage origination and broker business explained below and a increase in the volume of loans that we packaged and securitized sold by us 
in  revenues generated from our fee based outsourcing and broker origination business grew at a faster rate than revenues generated from packaging and selling mortgage loans to the secondary market ourselves 
production fee income on outsourced and brokered loans is generated at the time of closing  whereas originated mortgage loans held for sale generate revenues at the time of sale typically days after closing 
accordingly  our production revenue is now driven by more of a mix in both mortgage loans closed and mortgage loans sold as opposed to just loans sold 
production loans sold increased billion  generating incremental production revenues of million 
mortgage loans closed increased billion to billion  comprised of a billion increase in closed loans which were outsourced or brokered  and a million increase in closed loans to be securitized 
the increase in outsourced and brokered loan volume contributed incremental production revenues of million in compared with purchase mortgage closings grew to billion  and refinancings increased to billion 
additionally  in connection with our securitized loans we realized an increase in margin which is consistent with the mortgage industry operating at a higher percentage of loan production capacity 
net revenues from servicing mortgage loans declined million  excluding the million non cash provision of msrs 
however  recurring servicing fees fees received for servicing existing loans in the portfolio increased million primarily due to a year over year increase in the average servicing portfolio 
such recurring activity was more than offset by million of increased mortgage servicing rights amortization and valuation adjustments due to the high levels of refinancings and related loan prepayments  resulting from the lower interest rate environment  partially offset by million of incremental net gains from hedging and other derivative activities to protect against changes in the fair value of msr s due to fluctuations in interest rates 
revenues and adjusted ebitda of this segment were also negatively impacted by a reduction of million in revenue generated from relocation activities as a result of a decline in relocation related homesale activity and lower interest rates charged to our clients 
excluding the acquisition of nrt  operating and administrative expenses within this segment increased million 
higher expenses incurred to operate the mortgage business to support the continued high levels of mortgage loan production and related servicing activities were partially offset by a reduction in relocation related costs  adjusting to a weaker corporate spending environment 
hospitality revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively  primarily due to the acquisitions of fairfield resorts  inc in april  trendwest in april and equivest in february and certain other vacation rental companies abroad in and fairfield  for the first quarter of the period in which no comparable results were included in  trendwest  equivest and the other acquired vacation rental companies  contributed incremental revenues of million  million  million  and million  respectively  and incremental adjusted ebitda of million  million  million and million  respectively  in compared with excluding the impact from these acquisitions  revenues increased million  while adjusted ebitda declined million  respectively  year over year 
growth within our vacation rental group exclusive of acquisitions contributed incremental revenues of million in due to an increase in vacation weeks sold  primarily attributable to improved marketing efforts 
timeshare subscription and transaction revenues within our timeshare exchange business increased million primarily due to increases in exchange transactions and the average exchange fee 
during  we recognized an incremental million of income from providing the financing on timeshare unit sales at our fairfield subsidiary 
the additional financing income was generated as a result of a increase in the volume of contracts sold and a greater margin realized on contract sales as we benefited from a lower interest rate environment in compared with results within our lodging franchise operation continued to be suppressed during  subsequent to the september  terrorist attacks and their impact on an already weakening travel industry 
accordingly  royalties  marketing fund and reservations revenues within our lodging franchise operations were down million in compared with and initial franchise fees were down million over the same periods 
however  comparable year over year occupancy levels in our franchised lodging brands have shown improvement during in addition  preferred alliance revenues and adjusted ebitda declined million in compared with  primarily from contract expirations and a contract termination payment received in the prior year 
adjusted ebitda increased million from a venture master license agreement with marriott international  inc entered into during which converted the ownership of a third party license agreement 
upon the change in ownership  the license fee  formerly included within operating expenses  is now recorded as a minority interest expense 
excluding acquisitions  operating and administrative expenses within this segment increased approximately million in principally to support continued volume related growth in our timeshare exchange business throughout compared to travel distribution revenues and adjusted ebitda increased billion and million  respectively  in compared with  due to the october acquisitions of galileo and cheap tickets 
the galileo acquisition for the nine months ended september  the period in which no comparable results were included in contributed incremental revenues and adjusted ebitda of billion and million  respectively  while cheap tickets contributed incremental revenues of million and adjusted ebitda losses of million over the same period 
in addition  during the summer of  we acquired lodging 
com and trust international  two companies that supply reservation and distribution solution services to the hospitality industry 
lodging 
com and trust international s operating results were included from the acquisition dates forward and collectively contributed revenue of million with no contribution to adjusted ebitda during excluding the incremental contributions from the above mentioned acquisitions  revenues and adjusted ebitda of this segment increased million and million  respectively  in compared with galileo subscriber fees and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively  during due to the acquisition of national distribution companies ndc s in europe 
ndc s are independent organizations that market and sell galileo global distribution and computer reservation services to travel agents and other subscribers 
partially offsetting this increase was a decline of million in revenues generated from our travel agency business due to reductions in commission rates paid by the airlines  available net rate air inventory and members of travel related clubs which are serviced by us 
beginning with the fourth quarter  all quarterly periods became comparable in terms of being subsequent to the acquisitions of galileo and cheap tickets and the september terrorist attacks 
in fourth quarter  galileo air travel booking fees were relatively constant  compared with fourth quarter  as a increase in booking volumes was substantially offset by a decline in the effective yield per booking 
the decline in effective yield was heavily influenced by unusually high cancellation and re booking activity in the fourth quarter of due to the september  terrorist attacks 
adjusted ebitda in fourth quarter the period comparable with includes cost savings of approximately million that were realized in connection with the integration of the galileo and cheap tickets businesses  including cost reduction efforts that were initiated during fourth quarter to reflect expected business volumes subsequent to the september  terrorist attacks 
despite a rebound in travel post september   our travel related booking volumes have not yet reached pre september  levels 
approximately of galileo s gds global distribution services revenue is generated by united air lines  inc  the largest single travel supplier utilizing galileo s systems 
in december  ual corporation  the parent of united air lines  filed for bankruptcy protection 
we do not expect to incur any material losses due to non payment by united air lines of amounts outstanding as our contracts were granted approval for payment 
however  if ual does not successfully emerge from this bankruptcy  we would not expect to recover amounts outstanding  which could approximate million  and we would expect that certain of galileo s contributions to revenues such as revenue derived from web site and reservation hosting would be negatively impacted in future periods 
during  we generated approximately million of such revenues primarily on a cost plus basis from these activities with united air lines 
we would not expect this bankruptcy to have a material impact to any of our other revenue streams 
vehicle services revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively  in versus the comparable prior year 
principally driving these increases were the incremental contributions made by avis group holdings  inc comprised of the avis rental car business and our fleet management operations  which we acquired on march  prior to the acquisition of avis  revenues and adjusted ebitda of this segment consisted of franchise royalties received from avis and earnings losses from our equity investment in avis 
avis operating results were included from the acquisition date forward and therefore included ten months of results in march through december 
accordingly  the avis acquisition for january and february of the period for which no comparable results were included in contributed incremental revenues and adjusted ebitda of million and million  respectively 
additionally  the operating results of budget were also included from the acquisition date of november  forward and contributed revenues and adjusted ebitda of million and million  respectively  in on a comparable basis  post acquisition ten months ended december  versus the comparable prior year period  revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively 
for the ten months ended december   avis car rental revenues increased million over the comparable period in  primarily due to a increase in time and mileage revenue per rental day 
a majority of the increase in time and mileage revenue per rental day was supported by an increase in pricing  the impact of which substantially flows to adjusted ebitda  and an increased share of domestic airport revenue generated by car rental companies 
the increase in adjusted ebitda was principally supported by the gross margin on the revenue growth 
avis revenues are primarily derived from car rentals at airport locations 
through november the last period for which information is available  approximately of avis revenues were generated from car rental locations at airports 
avis increased its share of total car rental revenues generated at domestic airports through november to compared with a share over the same eleven month period last year and has recognized airport revenue share gains in consecutive months since february for the eleven months ended november   avis realized a increase in its comparable year over year domestic airport revenues versus a total market segment decline of over the same periods 
based on our accumulation of data thus far pertaining to december  we do not expect any significant change in this favorable trend of increased market share for december  once industry data for december is complete 
in our vehicle leasing and fleet management program businesses  revenues collectively declined million during the comparable ten months ended december  compared with  principally due to lower interest expense on vehicle funding  which is substantially passed through to clients and therefore results in lower revenues but has minimal adjusted ebitda impact 
this was partially offset by an increase in depreciation on leased vehicles which is also passed through to clients 
financial services adjusted ebitda increased million in compared with  despite a million decrease in revenue 
adjusted ebitda was favorably impacted by the outsourcing of our individual membership business  in which a net decline of million in membership related revenues net of million of royalty income from trilegiant due to a lower membership base was more than offset by a net reduction in expenses from servicing fewer members and not directly incurring the cost of marketing to solicit new members see liquidity and capital resources trilegiant corporation for a detailed discussion of our outsourcing arrangement with trilegiant 
marketing expenses decreased by million in compared with due to a reduction in new member marketing costs in in addition  during fourth quarter  trilegiant increased its solicitation efforts and incurred million of marketing costs that we were contractually required to fund and  as such  expense 
in addition  membership operating expenses decreased by approximately million due to cost savings from servicing fewer members 
in connection with the trilegiant transaction  during the third quarter of last year  we incurred million of transaction related expenses  the absence of which in the current year also contributed to the increase in adjusted ebitda 
jackson hewitt generated incremental revenues of million in in january  we acquired our largest tax preparation franchisee  tax services of america tsa 
tsa contributed incremental revenues of million and adjusted ebitda of approximately million net of intercompany royalties to jackson hewitt s results 
jackson hewitt also generated incremental revenues of million in from various financial products 
additionally  on a comparable basis  including post acquisition intercompany royalties paid by tsa  jackson hewitt franchise royalties increased million 
the increase in jackson hewitt royalties was driven by a increase in tax return volume  and a increase in the average price per return 
additional operating and overhead costs were incurred in due to an expansion of jackson hewitt s infrastructure to support increased business activity and a reorganization and relocation of the jackson hewitt technology group 
our domestic insurance wholesale businesses generated million less revenue in compared with from a lower profit share from insurance companies as a result of higher than expected claims 
this was offset by growth within our international loyalty solutions operations 
corporate and other revenue and adjusted ebitda decreased million and million  respectively  in compared with in february  we sold our real estate internet portal  move 
com  and certain ancillary businesses  which collectively accounted for a year over year decline in revenues of million and an improvement in adjusted ebitda of million 
in addition  revenues recognized from providing electronic reservation processing services to avis prior to the acquisition of avis resulted in a million revenue decrease with no adjusted ebitda impact as avis paid royalties but was billed for reservation services at cost 
revenues also included incremental inter segment revenue eliminations in due to increased intercompany business activities  principally resulting from acquisitions 
adjusted ebitda also includes higher unallocated corporate overhead costs due to increased administrative expenses and infrastructure expansion to support company growth

our operating results benefited by million less minority interest as a result of the maturity of the feline prides in february however  our operating results were negatively impacted by after tax losses of million related to our equity ownership in homestore 
as a result of the above mentioned items  income from continuing operations decreased million  or  during discussed below are the operating results for each of our segments  which focuses on revenues and adjusted ebitda 
adjusted ebitda is defined as earnings before non program related interest  income taxes  non program related depreciation and amortization  minority interest and  in  equity in homestore 
such measure is then adjusted to exclude items that are of a non recurring or unusual nature and are also not measured in assessing segment performance 
in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related information  our management believes such discussions are the most informative representation of how management evaluates performance 
however  our presentation of adjusted ebitda may not be comparable with similar measures used by other companies

such charges were partially offset by i a gain of million related to the sale of our real estate internet portal  ii a gain of million related to the disposition of non strategic businesses and iii a credit of million to reflect an adjustment to the settlement charge recorded in the fourth quarter of for the prides class action litigation 
adjusted ebitda for excludes i a gain of million  which represents the recognition of a portion of our previously recorded deferred gain from the sale of our former fleet business due to the disposition of vms europe by avis in august and ii a credit of million to reflect an adjustment to the above mentioned prides litigation 
such amounts were partially offset by i million of litigation and related costs and ii million of losses related to the disposition of non strategic businesses 
real estate services revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively 
the increase in operating results was primarily driven by substantial growth in mortgage loans sold due to increased refinancing activity and purchase volume 
higher franchise fees from our century  coldwell banker and era franchise brands and increases in relocation services also contributed to the favorable operating results 
offsetting the revenue increases  operating and administrative expenses within this segment increased million primarily to support the higher volume of mortgage originations and related servicing activities 
collectively  mortgage loans sold increased billion to billion  generating incremental revenues of million  a increase 
closed mortgage loans increased billion to billion in such growth consisted of a billion increase approximately ten fold in refinancings and a billion increase in purchase mortgage closings 
a significant portion of mortgage loans closed in any quarter will generate revenues in future periods as those loans closed are packaged and sold and revenue is recognized upon the sale of the loan  which is typically to days after closing 
beginning in january  merrill lynch outsourced its mortgage loan origination and servicing operations to us under a year agreement  which accounted for billion of our mortgage closings in consideration paid to merrill lynch for this outsourcing agreement was not material 
partially offsetting record production revenues was a million decline in net loan servicing revenue 
the average servicing portfolio grew billion resulting from the high volume of mortgage loan originations and our purchase of rights to service billion of existing mortgage loans owned by merrill lynch  however  accelerated servicing amortization expenses during  due primarily to refinancing activity  more than offset the increase in recurring servicing fees from the portfolio growth 
franchise fees from our real estate franchise brands also contributed to revenue and adjusted ebitda growth 
royalties and other franchise fees increased million  despite only modest industry wide growth and a year over year industry decline in california  principally due to a increase in the average price of homes sold and a million fee received from nrt in connection with the termination of a franchise agreement under which nrt operated our century real estate brand 
service based fees from relocation activities also contributed to the increase in revenues and adjusted ebitda principally due to a million increase in referral fees resulting from increased volume  which included the execution of new service contracts 
in addition  asset based relocation revenues decreased by million  which was comprised of a million revenue decline due to lower corporate and government homesale closings  partially offset by a million increase in net interest income from relocation operations due to reduced debt levels in hospitality revenues and adjusted ebitda increased million and million  respectively 
while our april acquisition of fairfield produced the bulk of this growth  our pre existing timeshare exchange operations also made contributions 
prior to the acquisition of fairfield  the results of this segment consisted principally of royalties earned on our lodging brands and exchange fees earned from our timeshare exchange business  resort condominium international  llc 
fairfield contributed revenues and adjusted ebitda of million and million  respectively  during in addition  the first quarter acquisition of holiday cottages group limited  the leading uk brand in self catering vacation home rentals  contributed incremental revenues and adjusted ebitda of million and million  respectively  in notwithstanding the negative impact that the september  terrorist attacks had on the economy s travel sector  timeshare subscription and transaction fees increased million supported by increases in both members and exchange transactions 
a corresponding increase in timeshare related staffing costs was incurred to support volume growth and meet anticipated service levels 
revenues and adjusted ebitda in this segment include a decline in preferred alliance fees of million  principally due to the expiration of a vendor contract in royalties  marketing fund and reservations revenues from our lodging franchise operations declined million and million  respectively  due to a decrease in revenue per available room 
lower marketing fund revenues received from franchisees were offset by lower expenses incurred on the marketing of our nine lodging brands 
the september  terrorist attacks caused a decline in the occupancy levels and room rates of our franchised lodging properties in the fourth quarter of travel distribution prior to the acquisitions of galileo and cheap tickets  revenue and adjusted ebitda for this segment principally comprised the operations of cendant travel  our travel agent subsidiary 
galileo contributed revenues and adjusted ebitda of million and million  respectively  while cheap tickets contributed revenues and expenses of million each and made no contribution to adjusted ebitda 
the september  terrorist attacks caused a decline in demand for travel related services and  accordingly  reduced the booking volumes for galileo and our travel agency businesses below fourth quarter levels 
galileo worldwide booking volume for air travel declined in fourth quarter compared with fourth quarter and other travel related bookings car  hotel  etc 
were down for the comparable periods 
upon completing the acquisitions of galileo and cheap tickets  in response to the existing economic conditions  we not only moved aggressively to integrate these businesses and achieve expected synergies  but we also re examined their cost structures and streamlined their operations through workforce reductions and other means to meet expected business volumes 
vehicle services revenues and adjusted ebitda increased billion and million  respectively  substantially due to the acquisition of avis in march prior to the acquisition of avis  revenues and adjusted ebitda of this segment consisted principally of earnings from our equity investment in avis and franchise royalties received from avis 
the acquisition of avis contributed incremental revenues and adjusted ebitda of billion and million  respectively  in avis results in were negatively impacted by reduced demand at airport locations due to a general decline in commercial travel throughout the year  which was further exacerbated by the september  terrorist attacks 
in response to the slowdown in commercial travel and in the wake of the september  terrorist attacks  we believe that we have rightsized our car rental operations to meet anticipated business levels  which included reductions in workforce and fleet fleet was downsized by approximately 
our fleet management and fuel card management businesses were not materially impacted by the september  terrorist attacks 
financial services revenues increased million while adjusted ebitda decreased million 
while the royalties we will receive from trilegiant will benefit segment results in future periods  the outsourcing of our individual membership business to trilegiant caused a decrease in adjusted ebitda during  largely due to million of our transaction related expenses and million of marketing spending by trilegiant  which we were contractually required to fund and  as such  expensed see discussion in liquidity and capital resources trilegiant corporation 
the transaction related expenses are comprised of the million write off of the entire amount of our preferred stock investment due to operating losses incurred by trilegiant in excess of the common equity and other expenses that include employee benefits and professional fees and a portion of the marketing advance that was expensed as trilegiant incurred qualified marketing expenses pursuant to the contractual terms of the agreement 
membership volumes and revenues declined  however  commissions increased due to higher commission rates 
conversely  the cost savings from servicing fewer members  as well as trilegiant s absorption of its share of fixed overhead expenses subsequent to the outsourcing  more than offset the lower membership revenues and higher commissions 
in addition  we acquired netmarket  an online membership business  during fourth quarter  which was immediately integrated into our existing membership business 
netmarket contributed incremental revenues of million in jackson hewitt  our tax preparation franchise business  contributed incremental revenues of million  principally comprised of higher royalties due to a increase in tax return volume  with relatively no corresponding increases in expenses due to the significant operating leverage within our franchise operations 
revenues and adjusted ebitda in included million of fees recognized from the sale of certain referral agreements 
corporate and other revenues decreased million while adjusted ebitda increased million 
our real estate internet portal and certain ancillary businesses  which were sold to homestore in february  collectively accounted for a decline in revenues of million and an improvement to adjusted ebitda of million because we were investing in the development and marketing of the portal during revenues and adjusted ebitda were negatively impacted by million less income from financial investments 
in addition  revenues recognized from providing electronic reservation processing services to avis ceased coincident with our acquisition of avis  contributing to a reduction in revenues of million with no adjusted ebitda impact since avis had been billed for such services at cost 
in december  we entered into a ten year  information technology services relationship with ibm whereby ibm will manage substantially all of our domestic data center operations 
adjusted ebitda in benefited from the absence of million of costs incurred in to pursue internet initiatives and also reflects increased unallocated corporate overhead costs principally due to infrastructure expansion to support company growth 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources the majority of our businesses operate in environments where we are paid a fee for services provided 
within our car rental  vehicle management  relocation  mortgage services and timeshare development businesses  we purchase assets or finance the purchase of assets on behalf of our clients 
assets generated in this process are classified as assets under management and mortgage programs 
we seek to offset the interest rate exposures inherent in these assets by matching them with financial liabilities that have similar term and interest rate characteristics 
as a result  we minimize the interest rate risk associated with managing these assets and create greater certainty around the financial income that they produce 
fees generated from our clients are used  in part  to repay the interest and principal associated with the financial liabilities 
funding for our assets under management and mortgage programs is also provided by both unsecured borrowings and secured financing arrangements  which are classified as liabilities under management and mortgage programs  as well as securitization facilities with special purpose entities 
cash inflows and outflows relating to the generation or acquisition of assets and the principal debt repayment or financing of such assets are classified as activities of our management and mortgage programs 
our finance activities vary from the rest of our businesses based upon the impact of the relative business and financial risks and asset attributes  as well as the nature and timing associated with the respective cash flows 
accordingly  we believe that it is appropriate to segregate our assets under management and mortgage programs and our liabilities under management and mortgage programs separately from the assets and liabilities of the rest of our businesses because  ultimately  the source of repayment of such liabilities is the realization of such assets 
financial condition change total assets exclusive of assets under management and mortgage programs total liabilities exclusive of liabilities under management and mortgage programs    assets under management and mortgage programs   liabilities under management and mortgage programs   mandatorily redeemable preferred securities stockholders equity    total assets exclusive of assets under management and mortgage programs decreased primarily due to i the application of billion of prior payments made to the stockholder litigation settlement trust to extinguish the remaining portion of our principal stockholder litigation settlement liability  ii the sale of billion of ncp assets and iii a billion reduction in cash see liquidity and capital resources cash flows below for a detailed discussion of such reduction 
such decreases were partially offset by i a billion net increase in goodwill and other intangible assets resulting primarily from the acquisitions of nrt  trendwest and the assets of budget and ii various other increases in assets resulting from the impact of acquired businesses 
for a detailed discussion of the activity and ending balance of goodwill  see notes and to our consolidated financial statements 
total liabilities exclusive of liabilities under management and mortgage programs decreased primarily due to i the extinguishment of our billion stockholder litigation settlement liability and ii the repurchase redemption of approximately billion of debt securities see liquidity and capital resources corporate indebtedness 
such decreases were partially offset by i million of borrowings drawn under our billion revolving credit facility during and ii various other increases in liabilities resulting from the impact of acquired businesses 
assets under management and mortgage programs increased primarily due to i an increase of billion in vehicles primarily due to the acquisition of the assets of budget  ii an increase of million in timeshare receivables primarily resulting from the acquisitions of trendwest and equivest and iii an increase of million in mortgage loans held for sale primarily due to timing differences arising between the origination and sales of such loans 
such increases were partially offset by i a decrease of million in restricted cash primarily due to the utilization of such amounts for the acquisition of vehicles and ii a net reduction of million to our mortgage servicing rights asset including the related derivatives due to valuation adjustments and related amortization  net of additions 
liabilities under management and mortgage programs increased primarily due to issuances of debt during to finance the growth in our portfolio of assets under management and mortgage programs  as discussed above see liquidity and capital resources debt related to management and mortgage programs for a detailed description of the change in debt related to management and mortgage programs 
stockholders equity increased primarily due to i million of net income generated during excluding the million reclassification of non cash foreign currency translation losses realized upon the sale of ncp  ii the issuance of million million shares in cd common stock in connection with the trendwest acquisition  iii the issuance of million million shares in cd common stock in connection with the acquisition of nrt  iv million relating to the sale of subsidiary stock in connection with our venture with marriott and v million related to the exercise of employee stock options 
such increases were partially offset by our repurchase of million million shares in cd common stock  of which million was repurchased using cash 
liquidity and capital resources our principal sources of liquidity are cash on hand and our ability to generate cash through operations and financing activities  as well as available credit and securitization facilities  each of which is discussed below 
cash flows at december   we had million of cash on hand  a decrease of approximately billion from approximately billion at december  reflecting  in part  management s efforts to apply our cash balances to reduce outstanding indebtedness and liabilities 
the following table summarizes such decrease year ended december  change cash provided by used in operating activities  a   investing activities  b   financing activities    effects of exchange rate changes on cash and cash equivalents cash provided by discontinued operations net change in cash and cash equivalents    a includes the application of prior payments made to the stockholder litigation settlement trust of billion  the march payment of million to the trust and the may payment of billion to the trust to fund the remaining balance of the settlement liability 
b includes billion of proceeds from the stockholder litigation settlement trust  which were used to extinguish the remaining portion of the principal stockholder litigation settlement liability 
during  we generated approximately billion less cash from operating activities primarily due to i billion of cash payments made in prior periods to the stockholder litigation settlement trust that were used during first quarter to extinguish the remaining portion of our principal stockholder litigation settlement liability and ii billion of payments made in to pay off the remaining balance of the stockholder litigation settlement liability 
partially offsetting these uses were greater operating cash flows generated by our avis car rental  galileo and mortgage businesses 
during  we used approximately billion less cash in investing activities primarily due to i the proceeds in of billion of prior payments made to the stockholder litigation settlement trust that were used to extinguish a portion of our stockholder litigation settlement liability  ii a reduction of billion in cash used for acquisitions  iii the proceeds of billion from the sale of ncp and iv the absence of billion of payments made in to the shareholder litigation settlement trust 
partially offsetting the decrease in cash used in investing activities was additional cash used to acquire vehicles for our car rental and fleet management operations 
capital expenditures during amounted to million and were utilized to support operational growth  enhance marketing opportunities and develop operating efficiencies through technological improvements 
we anticipate aggregate capital expenditure investments during in the range of million to million 
during  we used approximately billion of cash in financing activities as compared to generating approximately billion of cash during reflected in the cash we used during are i repayments of outstanding borrowings of million under revolving credit facilities at our phh subsidiary  ii debt redemptions of approximately billion  which are described in greater detail below see financial obligations corporate indebtedness and iii stock repurchases of million 
partially offsetting such uses was million of borrowings drawn under our billion revolving credit facility during we also intend to deploy our available cash to continue to repurchase current maturities of outstanding indebtedness and  subject to board approval  outstanding shares of our cd common stock beyond the current board authorized amount 
management currently expects that approximately half of our discretionary cash use during the fiscal year will be to effect debt repurchases  while the remainder will be used to acquire complementary businesses and repurchase outstanding shares 
we are also currently analyzing the benefits of paying dividends on our cd common stock in the future 
however  we can make no assurances that either such a dividend will be paid or that we will obtain board approval to increase our stock repurchase program 
as of december   we had approximately million of remaining availability under our board authorized cd common stock repurchase program 
during january and february  we repurchased approximately million shares of our cd common stock for approximately million in cash 
financial obligations at december   we had approximately billion of indebtedness including corporate indebtedness of billion  debt related to our management and mortgage programs of billion and our mandatorily redeemable interest of million 
our net debt excluding the upper decs and debt related to our management and mortgage programs and net of cash and cash equivalents to total capital including net debt and the upper decs ratio was and as of december  and  respectively  and the ratio of adjusted ebitda to net non program related interest expense was to and to for and  respectively

during  our corporate indebtedness decreased million due to i the redemption of our convertible subordinated notes for million  ii the repurchase of million of our zero coupon senior convertible contingent notes with a face value of approximately million  iii the repurchase of million of our notes  iv the repurchase of million of our zero coupon convertible debentures and v the repurchase of million of our senior subordinated notes 
in connection with the repurchase of these securities  we recorded extraordinary losses of million million after tax during these reductions were partially offset by i borrowings of million under our billion revolving credit facility  which were primarily used to fund the budget acquisition and related costs and ii other net reductions of million 
the significant terms for our outstanding debt instruments at december  can be found in note to our consolidated financial statements 
subsequent to december   we issued million of five year senior unsecured notes bearing interest at and billion of ten year senior unsecured notes bearing interest at for net proceeds of billion 
these notes are senior unsecured obligations and rank equally in right of payment with all our existing and future unsecured senior indebtedness 
the proceeds from such offering were used to repay outstanding corporate indebtedness as follows i million of our senior subordinated notes with a face value of million for million in cash  ii million of our zero coupon convertible debentures for million in cash  iii million of our notes with a face value of million for million in cash and iv million of borrowings under our revolving credit facility 
accordingly  we expect to record an after tax loss of approximately million during first quarter  which will reduce our income from continuing operations

as depicted above  these debt securities may be convertible into shares of our cd common stock upon the satisfaction of certain contingencies 
if these securities do indeed become convertible  it could have a material impact to our total number of shares outstanding and to the number of shares utilized in performing our earnings per share calculations 
as also depicted above  these debt securities include provisions that permit investors to require us to redeem the securities at their accreted value at specified times 
if our stock price fails to adequately appreciate from the date of issuance of these securities until their redemption date  we believe it is likely that investors would exercise their option to require us to redeem the securities absent any modification to the terms of the securities 
a redemption could cause us to utilize a material amount of cash to redeem such securities at their accreted value  however  we would not expect it to have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
the cost of redeeming and or refinancing such securities would depend on market conditions at the time and the type of securities  if any  issued for refinancing purposes 
as a result  our management considers the potential redemption of these securities in establishing and utilizing our credit facilities  in targeting our cash position and in evaluating additional issuances of debt securities 
we consider our access to capital adequate to meet our prospective obligations under the terms of these securities 
if holders were to require us to redeem these securities  we would fund such redemptions with available cash  borrowings under available credit facilities and or the issuance of debt or equity securities  we may also consider amending the terms of the securities to induce holders to retain  rather than redeem  these securities  although we currently have no intent to do so 
these securities also contain provisions that could require us to pay a higher interest rate on the securities if they remain outstanding after the date at which we begin to have the right to redeem them 
because we have the right to redeem the securities at their accreted value before any such provisions become effective  we do not believe these provisions would have an adverse impact on our results of operations compared to our results of operations using other financing sources available at that time 
upper decs because the upper decs obligate holders to purchase shares of our cd common stock at a price determined by the average closing price of cd common stock during a trading day period ending in august  the upper decs are functionally equivalent to issuing shares of cd common stock subject to an issue price collar  with a delay in issuance until the issuance of the cd common stock will have a material impact to the number of shares utilized in performing our earnings per share calculation in however  the upper decs could also materially impact our diluted earnings per share calculations prior to if the price of cd common stock exceeds the point at which we would be required to reflect the issuance of the cd common stock in the number of shares used to calculate diluted earnings per share 
at the time of issuance of the upper decs  we believed that the impact of issuing the upper decs would be favorable compared to an equivalent immediate issuance of common stock 
upon settlement of the forward purchase contracts in august  we expect to receive gross proceeds in cash of approximately million 
upon maturity in august of the senior notes that are currently a component of the upper decs  we would be required to repay million

bishop s gate has entered into swaps with several banks  the net effect of which is that the banks have agreed to bear certain interest rate risks  non credit related market risks and prepayment risks related to the mortgage loans held by bishop s gate 
additionally  phh has entered into separate corresponding swaps with the banks  the net effect of which is that phh has agreed to bear the interest rate risks  non credit related market risks and prepayment risks related to the mortgage loans held by bishop s gate assumed by the banks under their swap with bishop s gate 
we in turn offset the interest rate risks associated with the swaps by entering into forward delivery contracts for mortgage backed securities

liquidity risk our liquidity position may be negatively affected by unfavorable conditions in any one of the industries in which we operate  as we may not have the ability to generate sufficient cash flows from operating activities due to those unfavorable conditions 
additionally  our liquidity as it relates to both management and mortgage programs could be adversely affected by a deterioration in the performance of the underlying assets of such programs 
access to the principal financing program for our vehicle rental subsidiaries may also be impaired should general motors corporation or ford motor company not be able to honor its obligations to repurchase a substantial number of our vehicles 
our liquidity as it relates to mortgage programs is highly dependent on the secondary markets for mortgage loans 
access to certain of our securitization facilities and our ability to act as servicer thereto also may be limited in the event that our or phh s credit ratings are downgraded below investment grade and  in certain circumstances  where we or phh fail to meet certain financial ratios 
however  we do not believe that our or phh s credit ratings are likely to fall below such thresholds 
additionally  we monitor the maintenance of these financial ratios and as of december   we were in compliance with all covenants under these facilities 
when securitizing assets under management and mortgage programs  we make representations and warranties customary to the securitization markets  including eligibility characteristics of the assets transferred and servicing responsibilities

trip network  inc during march  we funded the creation of trip network with a contribution of assets valued at approximately million in exchange for all of the common and preferred stock of trip network 
we unilaterally transferred all the common shares of trip network to the hospitality technology trust htt and retained the preferred stock of trip network and warrants to purchase up to  shares of trip network s common stock 
trip network provides travel services to both our franchisees as well as non franchisees and  as such  our initial contribution of the trip network common stock to htt supported our lodging franchise business model whereby we endeavored to avoid direct competition with our franchisees for the sale of transient hotel rooms 
htt is an independent technology trust that is controlled by three independent trustees who are not officers  directors or employees of cendant or relatives of officers  directors or employees of cendant 
htt was established in for purposes of enhancing and promoting the use of advanced technology for our lodging brands  its beneficiaries  including providing financial and technology support services and investing in internet related activities for the benefit of its beneficiaries 
the hotel franchise chains have agreed to link their brand and property web sites to trip 
com because of  for among other reasons  their beneficial interest in htt 
a hotel franchise chain is not required to make any contributions to trip network in order for the franchisee s brand and property to be included on trip network s web site 
trip network earns a commission on all hotel rooms sold on its web site  including those sold by our hotel franchise chains  at market rates ranging from to 
management believes that the enhanced functionality for the brand and property web pages to be provided by trip 
com links will help build customer loyalty and avoid the problem of viewers leaving the brand and property web sites for the sites of competitors 
additionally  management believes that the aggregate links of all franchisee properties create critical mass and web traffic for trip network further enhancing its ability to be successful 
if trip network is successful  then management believes the common shares will likely appreciate in value 
the liquidation of shares representing htt s equity stake  which approximates of trip network s common stock on a fully diluted basis will provide htt with further resources to pursue its stated objectives 
in  we contributed million  including million in cash and million shares of homestore common stock then valued at million  to trip network for the purpose of pursuing the development of an online travel business for the benefit of certain of our current and future franchisees 
this arrangement is consistent with our strategy of creating a single platform to research and develop internet related products within an integrated business plan 
since we did not have the in house expertise to develop new technology for internet web sites  we outsourced the development of certain internet assets and web site features to trip network through the existing arrangement 
since the advance is repayable to us only if the development results in the achievement of certain financial results  such amount was expensed by us during and is included as a component of restructuring and other unusual charges in our consolidated statement of income 
as of december   none of the financial results that would have caused the repayment of this advance had been achieved 
during october  we entered into two separate lease and licensing agreements with trip network  whereby trip network was granted a license to operate the online businesses of trip 
com  inc and cheap tickets both wholly owned subsidiaries of cendant and a lease or sublease  as applicable  to all the assets of these companies necessary to operate such businesses 
the trip 
com license agreement has a one year term and is renewable at trip network s option for additional one year periods 
the cheaptickets 
com license agreement has a year term 
under these agreements  we receive a license fee of of revenues generated by trip 
com and cheaptickets 
com during the term of the agreements 
the royalty rate was negotiated with and approved by trip network s board of directors 
we proposed our royalty rate based upon market rate analysis of similar licensing type agreements 
in connection with this agreement  we also received warrants to purchase up to  shares of trip network common stock  which are exercisable  at our option  at a price of per share  upon achievement of certain financial results beginning in october or upon a change of control of trip network 
the warrants were also negotiated with and approved by trip network s board of directors 
during  we recognized million of revenue in connection with this agreement 
during  the revenue recorded by us in connection with this agreement was not material 
also during october  we entered into a travel services agreement with trip network  whereby we provide trip network with call center services 
in addition  we process and support trip network s booking and fulfillment of travel transactions and provide travel related products and services to maintain and develop relationships  discounts and favorable commissions with travel vendors 
for these services  we receive a fee of cost plus an applicable mark up  which was determined based upon an examination of profit margins in the travel agency industry 
during  we recognized million of revenue in connection with this agreement 
during  the revenue recorded by us in connection with this agreement was not material 
additionally  during october  we entered into a year global distribution services subscriber agreement with trip network  whereby we provide all global distribution services for trip network 
pursuant to such agreement  we  through our galileo subsidiary  receive payments from airlines  car rental agencies and hoteliers each time trip network books a reservation using the galileo global distribution system 
as it is normal and customary for a global distribution system provider to pay incentive fees to a travel agency  we prepaid trip network million as compensation for booking segments through galileo 
accordingly  on the date of commitment  we recorded an asset of million for prepaid incentive fees  which is being amortized over years  and a related credit in accounts payable and other current liabilities as we did not disburse the cash until january such amount was mutually agreed to and represented the projected discounted amount of incentive fees that we expected to pay trip network over the term of the year licensing agreement 
we benefited from such prepayment by receiving a discount on the lump sum payment of incentive fees upon consummation of the contract rather than paying a portion of the incentive fee in advance and a portion of the incentive fee as segments are booked 
amortization of the asset is calculated in direct proportion to the expected cash flow benefits 
during  amortization recorded by us relating to this prepaid asset was million 
the amortization we recorded during was not material 
as of december  and  the prepaid asset approximated million and million  respectively  and was included within other non current assets on our consolidated balance sheets 
our preferred stock investment  which is convertible into approximately of trip network s common stock on a fully diluted basis  is non voting and accounted for using the cost method 
the preferred stock investment is not convertible prior to march  except upon a change of control of trip network 
as of december  and  our preferred equity interest in trip network approximated million 
during the years ended december  and  we did not record any dividend income relating to our preferred equity interest in trip network 
the warrants are exercisable  at our option  upon the achievement of certain financial results beginning on march  or upon a change of control of trip network at an exercise price of per share 
as of december   none of the financial results which would cause the warrants to be exercisable had been achieved 
we are not obligated or contingently liable for any debt incurred by trip network 
management is currently engaged in discussions with the trustees of htt to negotiate our acquisition of the common stock of trip network  which is expected to occur during second quarter the consolidation of trip network upon acquisition will not have a material impact on our consolidated results of operations or any trends related thereto 
ffd development company  llc prior to our acquisition of fairfield resorts  inc in april  fairfield operated its own property acquisition  planning  design and construction functions 
these functions were transferred by fairfield to ffd development company llc ffd immediately prior to our acquisition of fairfield  along with fairfield employees who were responsible for these functions 
given the extensive knowledge of fairfield s standards and specifications as it related to the procurement of property and the planning and construction of timeshares  we continued to rely on the relationship between fairfield and ffd throughout and however  we continued to penetrate the timeshare industry in with our acquisitions of trendwest and equivest and  as a result  developed the ability to integrate ffd into the cendant timeshare businesses in a manner that would be both effective and cost beneficial 
accordingly  on february   we acquired all of the common equity interests of ffd see note subsequent events 
therefore  ffd will be included within our consolidated results of operations and financial position beginning on february  for a detailed discussion of our relationship with ffd and the impact thereof on our results of operations and financial position during and  see note to our consolidated financial statements

change in accounting policies goodwill and other intangible assets 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  in its entirety 
in connection with the adoption of this standard  we have not amortized any goodwill or indefinite lived intangible assets during prior to the adoption  all intangible assets were amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated periods to be benefited 
therefore  the results of operations for and reflect the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  while the results of operations for do not reflect such amortization see note intangible assets to our consolidated financial statements for a pro forma disclosure depicting our results of operations during and after applying the non amortization provisions of sfas no 

in connection with the implementation of sfas no 
 we were required to assess goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets for impairment 
we reviewed the carrying value of our reporting units by comparing such amounts to their fair value and determined that the carrying value of our reporting units did not exceed their respective fair values 
accordingly  the initial implementation of this standard and the annual testing did not result in a charge and  as such  did not impact our results of operations during impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this standard supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and replaces the accounting and reporting provisions of apb opinion no 
 reporting results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  as it relates to the disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no 
requires the use of a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  including discontinued operations  by requiring those long lived assets to be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
the impairment recognition and measurement provisions of sfas no 
were retained for all long lived assets to be held and used with the exception of goodwill 
accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities 
on april   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
in its entirety 
this standard revised the criteria for accounting for securitizations  other financial asset transfers and collateral and introduced new disclosures  but otherwise carried forward most of the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities without amendment 
the impact of adopting the remaining provisions of this standard was not material to our financial position or results of operations 
recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained interests in securitized financial assets 
on january   we adopted the provisions of the emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 recognition of interest income and impairment on purchased and retained interests in securitized financial assets 
prior to the adoption of eitf issue no 
 we accounted for impairment of beneficial interests in securitizations in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities  and eitf issue no 
 recognition of impairment for an investment in a collateralized mortgage obligation instrument or in a mortgage backed interest only certificate 
eitf issue no 
modified the accounting for interest income and impairment of beneficial interests in securitization transactions  whereby beneficial interests determined to have an other than temporary impairment are required to be written down to fair value 
the adoption of eitf issue no 
resulted in the recognition of a non cash charge of million million  after tax in first quarter to account for the cumulative effect of the accounting change 
accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
on january   we adopted the provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
this standard  as amended and interpreted  establishes accounting and reporting standards for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
as required by sfas no 
 we have recorded all such derivatives at fair value in the consolidated balance sheets 
the adoption of this standard resulted in the recognition of a non cash charge of million million  after tax in the consolidated statement of income on january  to account for the cumulative effect of the accounting change relating to derivatives designated in fair value type hedges prior to adopting this standard  to derivatives not designated as hedges and to certain embedded derivatives 
as provided for in sfas no 
 we also reclassified certain financial investments as trading securities at january   which resulted in a pre tax net benefit of million recorded in other revenues within the consolidated statement of income 
recently issued accounting pronouncements early extinguishment of debt 
in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
such standard requires any gain or loss on extinguishments of debt to be presented as a component of continuing operations unless specific criteria are met whereas sfas no 
required that such gains and losses be classified as an extraordinary item in determining net income 
upon adoption of this standard  we expect to reclassify any extraordinary gains or losses on the extinguishments of debt recorded in prior periods to continuing operations 
we will adopt these provisions on january   as required 
the other provisions of sfas no 
were not relevant to us 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
such standard requires costs associated with exit or disposal activities including restructurings to be recognized when the costs are incurred  rather than at a date of commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
sfas no 
nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
under sfas no 
 a liability related to an exit or disposal activity is not recognized until such liability has actually been incurred whereas under eitf issue no 
a liability was recognized at the time of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the provisions of this standard are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we will adopt this standard on january   as required 
guarantees 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
such interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor about its obligations under certain guarantees issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation apply to guarantees issued or modified after december  we will adopt these provisions on january  the disclosure provisions of this interpretation are effective for financial statements with annual periods ending after december  we have applied the disclosure provisions of this interpretation as of december   as required see note commitments and contingencies to our consolidated financial statements 
stock based compensation 
on december   the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
this standard amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
this standard also requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
we have applied the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
as of december  see note summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements for a table that illustrates the effect on net income and earnings per share if the fair value based method had been applied during each period presented 
as permitted by sfas no 
 during  we measured stock based compensation using the intrinsic value approach under accounting principles board opinion no 
accordingly  we did not recognize compensation expense upon the issuance of our stock options because the option terms were fixed and the exercise price equaled the market price of the underlying cd common stock on the grant date 
we complied with the provisions of sfas no 
by providing pro forma disclosures of net income and related per share data giving consideration to the fair value method provisions of sfas no 
on january   we adopted the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation provisions of sfas no 
 which is considered by the fasb to be the preferable accounting method for stock based employee compensation  and have elected to use the prospective method permitted by sfas no 
therefore  the transition provisions of sfas no 
will be adopted concurrently with the fair value based recognition provisions of sfas no 
on january  subsequently  we will expense all future employee stock awards over the vesting period based on the fair value of the award on the date of grant in accordance with the prospective transition method 
consolidation of variable interest entities 
on january   the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
such interpretation addresses consolidation of entities that are not controllable through voting interests or in which the equity investors do not bear the residual economic risks and rewards 
these entities have been commonly referred to as special purpose entities 
the interpretation provides guidance related to identifying variable interest entities and determining whether such entities should be consolidated 
it also provides guidance related to the initial and subsequent measurement of assets  liabilities and noncontrolling interests in newly consolidated variable interest entities and requires disclosures for both the primary beneficiary of a variable interest entity and other beneficiaries of the entity 
for variable interests entities created  or interests in variable interest entities obtained  subsequent to january   we are required to apply the consolidation provisions of this interpretation immediately 
to date  we have not created a variable interest entity nor obtained an interest in a variable interest entity for which we would be required to apply the consolidation provisions of this interpretation immediately 
for variable interest entities created  or interests in variable interest entities obtained  on or before january   the consolidation provisions of this interpretation are first required to be applied in our financial statements as of july  for these variable interest entities  we expect to apply the prospective transition method whereby the consolidation provisions of this interpretation are applied prospectively with a cumulative effect adjustment  if necessary  as of july  this interpretation also requires certain disclosures herein if it is reasonably possible that we will consolidate or disclose information about a variable interest entity when we initially apply the guidance in this interpretation 
we have applied the disclosure provisions of this interpretation as of december  we are currently evaluating the impact of adopting this interpretation 
thus far  we have concluded that the adoption of this interpretation will result in the consolidation of the mortgage securitization facility  bishop s gate residential mortgage trust  as of july  the consolidation of bishop s gate is not expected to affect our results of operations 
however  had we consolidated bishop s gate as of december   our total assets and liabilities under management and mortgage programs would have increased by approximately billion each 
see note transfers and servicing of financial assets to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of the bishop s gate mortgage securitization facility 
additionally  based upon a preliminary analysis  we believe that upon adoption of this interpretation  it is possible that we may be required to consolidate trilegiant corporation as of july  this assessment is based upon facts and circumstances in existence as of the date of this filing 
however  we have been engaged in discussions with trilegiant to address enhancements to their business model and expect modifications to our existing contractual relationships 
such modifications would require us to reapply the criteria set forth in this interpretation  which could result in a different conclusion whereby we would not be required to consolidate trilegiant 
however  if we were to be unsuccessful in our endeavors  we believe that the consolidation of trilegiant would cause our total assets and total liabilities to increase by approximately million and million approximately million of which represents deferred income  respectively  on july  additionally  we expect that the consolidation of trilegiant  if necessary  would result in a non cash charge of approximately million  which would be recorded on july  as a cumulative effect of accounting change but would not impact our continuing results of operations 
additionally  the consolidation of trilegiant would not result in any changes to our consolidated financial statements for any prior periods including first and second quarters of 
further  we do not expect that the consolidation of trilegiant would materially impact our results of operations  financial position or cash flows in any future periods 
see note related party transactions to our consolidated financial statements for a detailed description of our relationship with trilegiant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we use various financial instruments  particularly swap contracts  forward delivery commitments and futures and options contracts to manage and reduce the interest rate risk related specifically to our committed mortgage pipeline  mortgage loan inventory  mortgage servicing rights  mortgage backed securities  debt and certain other interest bearing liabilities 
foreign currency forwards are also used to manage and reduce the foreign currency exchange rate risk associated with our foreign currency denominated receivables and forecasted royalties  forecasted earnings of foreign subsidiaries and forecasted foreign currency denominated acquisitions 
we are exclusively an end user of these instruments  which are commonly referred to as derivatives 
we do not engage in trading  market making  or other speculative activities in the derivatives markets 
more detailed information about these financial instruments is provided in note financial instruments to our consolidated financial statements 
our principal market exposures are interest and foreign currency rate risks 
interest rate movements in one country  as well as relative interest rate movements between countries can materially impact our profitability 
our primary interest rate exposure is to interest rate fluctuations in the united states  specifically long term us treasury and mortgage interest rates due to their impact on mortgage related assets and commitments and also libor and commercial paper interest rates due to their impact on variable rate borrowings and other interest rate sensitive liabilities 
we anticipate that such interest rates will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
our primary foreign currency rate exposure is to exchange rate fluctuations in the british pound sterling 
we anticipate that such foreign currency exchange rate risk will remain a primary market risk exposure for the foreseeable future 
we assess our market risk based on changes in interest and foreign currency exchange rates utilizing a sensitivity analysis 
the sensitivity analysis measures the potential impact in earnings  fair values and cash flows based on a hypothetical change increase and decrease in interest and currency rates 
we use a discounted cash flow model in determining the fair values of relocation receivables  timeshare receivables  equity advances on homes  mortgage loans  commitments to fund mortgages  mortgage servicing rights  mortgage backed securities and our retained interests in securitized assets 
the primary assumptions used in these models are prepayment speeds  estimated loss rates  and discount rates 
in determining the fair value of mortgage servicing rights and mortgage backed securities  the models also utilize credit losses and mortgage servicing revenues and expenses as primary assumptions 
in addition  for commitments to fund mortgages  the borrower s propensity to close their mortgage loan under the commitment is used as a primary assumption 
for mortgage loans  commitments to fund mortgages  forward delivery contracts and options  we rely on prices sourced from bloomberg in determining the impact of interest rate shifts 
we also utilize an option adjusted spread oas model to determine the impact of interest rate shifts on mortgage servicing rights and mortgage backed securities 
the primary assumption in an oas model is the implied market volatility of interest rates and prepayment speeds and the same primary assumptions are used in determining fair value 
we use a duration based model in determining the impact of interest rate shifts on our debt portfolio  certain other interest bearing liabilities and interest rate derivatives portfolios 
the primary assumption used in these models is that a increase or decrease in the benchmark interest rate produces a parallel shift in the yield curve across all maturities 
we use a current market pricing model to assess the changes in the value of the us dollar on foreign currency denominated monetary assets and liabilities and derivatives 
the primary assumption used in these models is a hypothetical weakening or strengthening of the us dollar against all our currency exposures at december   and our total market risk is influenced by a wide variety of factors including the volatility present within the markets and the liquidity of the markets 
there are certain limitations inherent in the sensitivity analyses presented 
while probably the most meaningful analysis  these shock tests are constrained by several factors  including the necessity to conduct the analysis based on a single point in time and the inability to include the complex market reactions that normally would arise from the market shifts modeled 
we used december   and market rates on our instruments to perform the sensitivity analyses separately for each of our market risk exposures interest and currency rate instruments 
the estimates are based on the market risk sensitive portfolios described in the preceding paragraphs and assume instantaneous  parallel shifts in interest rate yield curves and exchange rates 
we have determined that the impact of a change in interest and foreign currency exchange rates and prices on our earnings  fair values and cash flows would not be material 
while these results may be used as benchmarks  they should not be viewed as forecasts
