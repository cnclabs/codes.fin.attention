this use o f cash flow was primarily attributable to debt reduction and the purchase an d retirement of the company s common stock 
at december   the company s cash and marketable securities were million and working capital was million as compared to cash and marketabl e securities of million and working capital of million at december the causes of these declines are discussed in the preceding paragraphs management continues to believe that the real estate market is overvalued an d accordingly recent acquisitions have been limited to those select propertie s that meet the company s stringent financial requirements 
management believe s that the available working capital along with the million of availabilit y on the revolving credit facility  discussed below  puts the company in a n opportune position to fund acquisitions and grow the portfolio if and whe n attractive long term opportunities become available 
the cash needs of the company have been satisfied from funds generated b y current operations 
it is expected that future operational cash needs and th e cash required to repurchase the company s common stock will also be satisfie d from existing cash balances  marketable securities  ongoing operations an d borrowings under the revolver as hereinafter defined 
the primary source o f capital to fund additional real estate acquisitions and to make additiona l high yield mortgage loans will come from existing funds  borrowings under th e revolver  the sale  financing and refinancing of the company s properties an d from third party mortgages and purchase money notes obtained in connection wit h specific acquisitions 
in addition to the acquisition of properties for consideration consisting o f cash and mortgage financing proceeds  the company may acquire real properties i n exchange for the issuance of the company s equity securities 
the company ma y also finance acquisitions of other companies in the future with borrowings fro m institutional lenders and or the public or private offerings of debt or equit y securities 
the company currently has no agreements  commitments o r understandings with respect to the acquisition of real properties or othe r companies in exchange for equity securities 
funds of the company in excess of that needed for working capital  purchasin g real estate and arranging financing for real estate acquisitions are invested b y the company in corporate equity securities  corporate notes  certificates o f deposit  government securities and other financial instruments 
the company is the lessor of eight department stores that are currently lease d to kmart  which filed for protection under chapter of the us bankruptc y code on january  in addition  the company holds a interest in a joint venture which is accounted for by the company on the equity basis tha t owns two distribution centers that are also leased to kmart 
as part of it s reorganization  kmart announced the closure of approximately of its store s during the past year  as well as its anticipated emergence from chapter protection as early as april  to date  kmart has not rejected an y leases with the company  however the terms of one such lease have bee n renegotiated resulting in a temporary rent reduction 
although it is currentl y uncertain which remaining leases  if any  kmart will reject or affirm as part o f its reorganization  management believes that its leases and the leases of th e joint venture with kmart are at or below the fair market rent for comparabl e properties and as a result  the rejection of one or more leases is not expecte d to have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial position and o r results of operations of the company 
effective december   the company entered into a credit agreement wit h five banks which provides for an million revolving credit facilit y revolver 
the revolver may be increased under certain circumstances an d expires on december  under the revolver  the company will be provided with eligibility based upon th e sum of i of the aggregate annualized and normalized year to date ne t operating income of unencumbered eligible properties  as defined  capitalized a t  ii of the aggregate annualized and normalized year to date ne t operating income of unencumbered eligible hotel properties  as defined capitalized at  not to exceed the lesser of million or of tota l eligibility  iii the lesser of million or of the aggregat e annualized and normalized year to date net operating income of encumbere d eligible properties  as defined  capitalized at  iv the sum of o f eligible accounts receivable  of eligible inventory  and of eligibl e loans  as defined  v cash and cash equivalents in excess of working capital as defined  and vi of marketable securities  as defined 
at december  eligibility under the revolver was million  based upon the abov e terms and there were no amounts outstanding under the revolver 
the credi t agreement contains certain financial and restrictive covenants  includin g minimum consolidated equity  interest coverage  debt service coverage an d capital expenditures other than for real estate  and limitations o n indebtedness 
the company was in compliance with all covenants at december the credit agreement also contains provisions which allow the banks t o perfect a security interest in certain operating and real estate assets in th e event of a default  as defined in the credit agreement 
borrowings under th e revolver  at the company s option  bear interest at the bank s prime lendin g rate or at the london interbank offered rate libor at december plus for non cash collateralized borrowings and for cas h collateralized borrowings 
prior to obtaining the revolver  the company maintained a credit agreement wit h three banks which provided for both a million revolving credit facilit y and a million term loan 
this credit agreement was terminated effectiv e december  in conjunction with the execution of the revolver 
the ter m loan matured and was fully satisfied as of september  at december  there were no amounts outstanding under the revolving credit facility an d  outstanding on the term loan 
as of september   the company s interest rate swap agreement th e swap expired together with the satisfaction of the underlying term loan 
th e swap was classified as a cash flow hedge and was recorded as a component o f accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet a t december  and accumulated other comprehensive income was reduced by th e same amount  net of tax  with no impact on earnings 
the differential paid o r received on the swap was recognized as an adjustment to interest expense ove r the term of the agreement 
in strategies designed to hedge overall market risk  the company may sell commo n stock short and participate in put and or call options 
these instruments do no t qualify for hedge accounting and therefore changes in such derivatives fai r value are recognized in earnings 
these derivatives are recorded as a componen t of accounts payable and accrued liabilities in the consolidated balance sheets 
the company has undertaken the completion of environmental studies and o r remedial action at metex two new jersey facilities and filed an action agains t certain insurance carriers seeking recovery of costs incurred and to be incurre d in these matters

the company is subject to various litigation  legal and regulatory matters tha t arise in the ordinary course of business activities 
when management believes i t is probable that a liability has been incurred and such amounts are reasonabl y estimable the company provides for amounts that include judgments and penaltie s that may be assessed 
these liabilities are usually included in accounts payabl e and accrued liabilities or other long term liabilities in the consolidate d financial statements  depending on the anticipated payment date 
none of thes e matters are expected to result in a material adverse effect on the company s consolidated financial position or results of operations 
the current liabilities of the company have at times in the past exceeded it s current assets principally due to the financing of long term assets utilizin g short term borrowings and from the classification of current mortgag e obligations without the corresponding current asset for such properties 
futur e financial statements may reflect current liabilities in excess of curren t assets 
management is confident that through cash flow generated fro m operations  together with borrowings available under the revolver and the sal e of select assets  all obligations will be satisfied as they come due 
previous purchases of the company s common stock have reduced the company s additional paid in capital to zero and accordingly current year purchases i n excess of par value have reduced retained earnings

critical accounting policies and management estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in accordance wit h accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of americ a requires management to use judgment in making estimates and assumptions tha t affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  an d related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain of th e estimates and assumptions required to be made relate to matters that ar e inherently uncertain as they pertain to future events 
while management believe s that the estimates and assumptions used were the most appropriate  actua l results could differ significantly from those estimates under differen t assumptions and conditions 
the following is a description of those accountin g policies believed by management to require subjective and complex judgment s which could potentially affect reported results 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable real estate investmen t and management the company leases substantially all of its properties to tenant s under net leases which are accounted for as operating leases 
unde r this type of lease  the tenant is obligated to pay all operatin g costs of the property including real estate taxes  insurance an d repairs and maintenance 
revenue is recognized as it is earned an d deemed collectible 
gains on the sale of real estate assets an d equity investments are recorded when the gain recognition criteri a under generally accepted accounting principles in the united state s of america have been met 
certain lease agreements provide for additional rent based on a percentage of tenants sales 
these percentage rents are recorde d once the required sales levels are achieved 
income on leveraged leases is recognized by a method that produces a constant rate of return on the outstanding investment in the lease net of the related deferred tax liability in the years in which th e net investment is positive 
accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts net o f the allowance for doubtful accounts 
the company makes estimates o f the uncollectibility of its accounts receivable related to bas e rents  tenant escalations  expense reimbursements and othe r revenues 
the company analyzes accounts receivable and historica l bad debt levels  customer credit worthiness and current economi c trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtfu l accounts 
in addition  tenants in bankruptcy are analyzed an d estimates are made in connection with the expected recovery o f pre petition and post petition claims 
the company s net income i s directly affected by management s estimate of the collectibility o f accounts receivable 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable engineered products in general  sales are recorded when products are shipped an d collection is reasonably assured 
management believes that adequat e controls are in place to ensure compliance with contractual produc t specifications  a substantial history of such performance has bee n established and historical returns and allowances have not bee n significant 
if actual sales returns and allowances excee d historical amounts  the company s sales would be adversely affected accounts receivable are recorded at the outstanding amounts net o f the allowance for doubtful accounts 
estimates are used i n determining the company s allowance for doubtful accounts based o n historical collections experience  current economic trends and a percentage of its accounts receivable by aging category 
i n determining these percentages  the company looks at historica l write offs of its receivables 
the company also looks at the credi t quality of its customer base as well as changes in its credi t policies 
the company continuously monitors collections and payment s from its customers 
while credit losses have historically bee n within expectations and the provisions established  the compan y cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credi t loss rates that it has in the past 
the company s net income i s directly affected by management s estimate of the collectibility o f accounts receivable 
marketable securities the company determines the appropriate classification of marketabl e securities at the time of purchase and reassesses th e appropriateness of the classification at each reporting date 
a t december  and  all marketable securities held by th e company have been classified as either available for sale or tradin g and  as a result  are stated at fair value 
unrealized gains an d losses on available for sale securities are recorded as a separat e component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses on th e sale of securities as well as unrealized holding gains and losses o n trading securities  as determined on a first in  first out basis are included in the consolidated statements of income 
the company reviews its investments on a regular basis to evaluat e whether or not each security has experienced an other than temporar y decline in fair value 
if it is believed that a n other than temporary decline exists  the company will write down th e investment to market value and record the related write down as a loss on investments in the consolidated statements of income 
the company s net income is directly affected by management s classification of marketable securities as well as its determinatio n of whether an other than temporary decline in the value of it s investments exist 
inventories the company values inventory at the lower of cost or market  cos t being determined on a first in  first out basis 
the compan y regularly reviews inventory quantities on hand and records a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily o n existing and anticipated design and engineering changes to it s products as well as forecasts of future product demand 
th e company s net income is directly affected by management s estimat e of the realizability of inventories 
real estate land  buildings and improvements and equipment are recorded at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
expenditures fo r maintenance and repairs are charged to operations as incurred significant renovations and replacements  which improve the life o f the asset  are capitalized and depreciated over their estimate d useful lives 
depreciation is computed utilizing the straight line method over th e estimated useful lives of five to thirty nine years for building s and improvements and five to seven years for equipment 
assets held for sale are reported at the lower of the carryin g amount or fair value less costs to sell and depreciation i s discontinued 
property sales or dispositions are recorded when titl e transfers 
upon disposition  the related costs and accumulate d depreciation are removed from the respective accounts 
any gain o r loss on sale or disposition is recognized in accordance wit h accounting principles generally accepted in the united states o f america 
in the normal course of business  the company receive s offers for the sale of properties  either solicited or unsolicited for those offers that are accepted  the prospective buyer usuall y requires a due diligence period before consummation of th e transaction 
it is not unusual for matters to arise that result i n the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process 
i f circumstances arise that previously were considered unlikely and  a s a result  management decides not to sell a property classified a s held for sale  the property is reclassified as held for rental 
a property that is reclassified is measured and recorded individuall y at the lower of its carrying amount before being classified as hel d for sale  adjusted for any depreciation expense that would have bee n recognized had the property been continuously classified as held fo r rental or its fair market value at the date of the subsequen t decision not to sell 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to th e useful lives of its properties for purposes of determining th e amount of depreciation to reflect on an annual basis with respect t o those properties 
these assessments have a direct impact on th e company s net income 
should the company adjust the expected usefu l life of a particular asset  it would be depreciated over th e adjusted years  and result in a revised depreciation expense and ne t income 
discontinued operations the company is required to make certain subjective assessment s utilizing the provisions of sfas no 
in determining whether a long lived asset to be disposed of should be reclassified a s discontinued operations 
commencing in  the company consider s real property to be held for sale and reported as discontinue d operations if management has committed to a plan to sell the asse t under usual and customary terms and believes such sale will b e completed within one year 
in such event  the financial result s associated with these assets are reclassified as discontinue d operations for all periods presented 
although operating income income from continuing operations and income from discontinue d operations is directly affected by management s assessments  th e reclassification has no impact on net income 
long lived assets on a periodic basis  management assesses whether there are an y indicators that the value of its long lived assets may be impaired an asset s value is considered impaired only if management s estimate of current and projected operating cash flows undiscounte d and without interest charges of the asset over its remaining usefu l life is less than the net carrying value of the asset 
such cas h flow projections consider factors such as expected future operatin g income  trends and prospects  as well as the effects of demand competition and other factors 
to the extent impairment ha s occurred  the carrying amount of the asset would be written down t o an amount to reflect the fair value of the asset 
the company is required to make subjective assessments as to whethe r there are impairments in the value of its long lived assets an d other investments 
the company s net income is directly affected b y management s estimate of impairments 
in determining impairment  i f any  the company has adopted sfas no 
pension plan pension plans can be a significant cost of doing business  bu t represent obligations that will ultimately be settled far in th e future and therefore are subject to estimates 
pension accounting i s intended to reflect the recognition of future benefit costs over th e employee s approximate service period based on the terms of the pla n and the investment and funding decisions made by the company 
th e company is required to make assumptions regarding such variables a s the expected long term rate of return on assets and the discoun t rate applied to determine service cost and interest cost to arriv e at pension income or expense for the year 
the company accounts for its defined benefit pension plan i n accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions sfas no 
 which requires that amounts recognized in financia l statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
sfas no 
generally reduces the volatility of future income expense fro m changes in pension liability discount rates and the performance o f the pension plan s assets 
the most significant element in determining the company s pensio n income expense in accordance with sfas no 
is the expecte d return on plan assets 
the company has assumed that the expecte d long term rate of return on plan assets will be for a s compared to for based on the company s existing an d forecasted asset allocation and related long term investmen t performance results  the company believes that its assumption o f future returns of is reasonable 
the assumed long term rate o f return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner 
this produces the expected return on plan asset s that is included in pension income expense 
the difference betwee n this expected return and the actual return on plan assets i s deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains losses affects th e calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  future pensio n income expense 
the plan assets have earned a rate of return les s than in the last two years 
should this trend continue  futur e pension expense and required contributions could increase 
a basis point change in the expected long term rate of return on pla n assets would have changed fiscal pension expense by  item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk generally represents the risk of loss that may result from th e potential change in the value of a financial instrument as a result o f fluctuations in interest and currency exchange rates and in equity and commodit y prices 
derivative financial instruments are used by the company principally i n the hedging of overall market risks and the management of its interest rat e exposure 
the primary objective of the company s investment activities is to preserv e principal and maximize yields without significantly increasing market risk 
t o achieve this  management maintains a portfolio of cash equivalents an d investments in a variety of securities  primarily us investments in bot h common and preferred equity issues 
the company s interest income is most sensitive to changes in the general level s of us interest rates 
changes in us interest rates affect the interes t earned on the company s cash and cash equivalents 
the company s marketabl e securities consist of us investments in both common and preferred equit y issues and are subject to the fluctuations in us stock markets 
most of th e company s mortgages payable are fixed rate and self amortizing from the net cas h flow of the underlying properties 
the company s derivative instrument s primarily consist of put and or call options 
such derivatives are subject t o the fluctuations in us stock markets 
the company s term loan  which mature d on september   had a variable rate but was effectively hedged by th e swap  whose notional amount matched the principal balance of the variable rat e debt it hedged 
the company manufactures its products in the united states and mexico and sell s its products in those markets as well as europe  south america and asia 
as a result  the company s operating results could be affected by factors such a s changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in th e foreign markets in which the company distributes its products 
most of th e company s sales are denominated in us dollars 
a portion of the company s receivables are denominated in euros and are exposed to changes in exchang e rates with the us dollar 
when the us dollar strengthens against the euro the value of the nonfunctional currency sales decreases 
when the us dolla r weakens against the euro  the functional currency amount of sales increases overall  the company is a net receiver of euros and  as such  benefits from a weaker dollar  but is adversely affected by a stronger dollar relative to th e euro 
the company s manufacturing operations utilize various metal commoditie s principally stainless steel in the manufacturing process 
while key metal s purchased from foreign entities are generally denominated in us dollars fluctuations in the suppliers local currencies may impact pricing 
the compan y is unable to quantify the effects of such fluctuations  however  it does ente r into purchase commitments for certain key metals that generally do not excee d twelve months which tend to minimize short term currency fluctuations 
th e company s financial results  however  could be significantly affected b y fluctuations in metals pricing

recent accounting pronouncements in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no  rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fas b statement no 
 and technical corrections sfas no 

this statemen t eliminates the requirement to report gains and losses from extinguishment o f debt as extraordinary unless they meet the criteria of apb opinion sfas no also requires sale leaseback accounting for certain lease modifications tha t have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
th e changes related to lease accounting are effective for transactions occurrin g after may  and the changes related to debt extinguishment are effectiv e for fiscal years beginning after may  the impact of adopting th e provisions related to lease accounting did not have a material impact on th e company s financial position or results of operations 
the impact of adoptin g the provisions related to debt extinguishment is not expected to have a materia l impact on the company s financial position or results of operations

sfas no 
nullifie s emerging issues task force issue no 
and requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when th e liability is incurred 
this statement also establishes that fair value is th e objective for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas no

 accounting for stock base d compensation transition and disclosure  an amendment of fasb statement no sfas no 

sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting fo r stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a n entity that voluntarily changes to the fair value based method of accounting fo r stock based employee compensation 
it also amends the disclosure provisions o f sfas no 
to require prominent disclosure about the effects on reported ne t income of an entity s accounting policy decisions with respect to stock base d employee compensation 
the company has chosen to continue to account fo r stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in ap b opinion no
