item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and notes thereto 
forward looking statements when used within this document  the words expects  believes  anticipates  should  estimates  and similar expressions are intended to identify forward looking statements within the meaning of that term in section a of the securities exchange act of  as amended  and in section f of the securities exchange act of  as amended 
such forward looking statements involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties  and other factors  which may cause the actual results and performance of the company to be materially different from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
such factors are described in item a  risk factors and include changes in general economic conditions and in the markets in which the company operates and the impact of competition from new and existing storage and commercial facilities and other storage alternatives  which could impact rents and occupancy levels at the company s facilities  difficulties in the company s ability to evaluate  finance and integrate acquired and developed properties into the company s existing operations and to fill up those properties  which could adversely affect the company s profitability  the impact of the regulatory environment as well as national  state  and local laws and regulations including  without limitation  those governing real estate investment trusts  which could increase the company s expense and reduce the company s cash available for distribution  consumers failure to accept the containerized storage concept which would reduce the company s profitability  difficulties in raising capital at reasonable rates  which would impede the company s ability to grow  delays in the development process  which could adversely affect the company s profitability  and economic uncertainty due to the impact of war or terrorism could adversely affect our business plan 
we disclaim any obligation to publicly release the results of any revisions to these forward looking statements reflecting new estimates  events or circumstances after the date of this report 
critical accounting policies qualification as a reit income tax expense we believe that we have been organized and operated  and we intend to continue to operate  as a qualifying reit under the internal revenue code and applicable state laws 
a qualifying reit generally does not pay corporate level income taxes on its taxable income that is distributed to its shareholders  and accordingly  we do not pay or record as an expense income tax on the share of our taxable income that is distributed to shareholders 
given the complex nature of the reit qualification requirements  the ongoing importance of factual determinations and the possibility of future changes in our circumstances  we cannot provide any assurance that we actually have satisfied or will satisfy the requirements for taxation as a reit for any particular taxable year 
for any taxable year that we fail or have failed to qualify as a reit and applicable relief provisions did not apply  we would be taxed at the regular corporate rates on all of our taxable income  whether or not we made or make any distributions to our shareholders 
any resulting requirement to pay corporate income tax  including any applicable penalties or interest  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
unless entitled to relief under specific statutory provisions  we also would be disqualified from taxation as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
there can be no assurance that we would be entitled to any statutory relief 
impairment of long lived assets substantially all of our assets consist of long lived assets  including real estate  assets associated with the containerized storage business  goodwill  and other intangible assets 
we quarterly evaluate our long lived assets for impairment 
as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  the evaluation of goodwill for impairment entails valuation of the reporting unit to which goodwill is allocated  which involves significant judgment in the area of projecting earnings  determining appropriate price earnings multiples  and discount rates 
in addition  the evaluation of other long lived assets for impairment requires determining whether indicators of impairment exist  which is a subjective process 
when any indicators of impairment are found  the evaluation of such long lived assets then entails projections of future operating cashflows  which also involves significant judgment 
we have identified no such impairments at december   other than those denoted with respect to the containerized storage activities 
however  future events  or facts and circumstances that currently exist that we have not yet identified  could cause us to conclude in the future that our long lived assets are impaired 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
estimated useful lives of long lived assets substantially all of our assets consist of depreciable  long lived assets 
we record depreciation expense with respect to these assets based upon their estimated useful lives 
any change in the estimated useful lives of those assets  caused by functional or economic obsolescence or other factors  could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
estimated level of retained risk liabilities as described in note to the consolidated financial statements  we retain certain risks with respect to property perils  legal liability  and other such risks 
in connection with our retention of these risks  we accrue losses based upon our estimated level of losses incurred using certain actuarial assumptions followed in the insurance industry and based upon our experience 
while we believe that the amounts of the accrued losses are adequate  the ultimate liability may be in excess of or less than the amounts provided 
accruals for contingencies we are exposed to business and legal liability risks with respect to events that have occurred  but in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  we have not accrued for such potential liabilities because the loss is either not probable or not estimable or because we are not aware of the event 
future events and the result of pending litigation could result in such potential losses becoming probable and estimable  which could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition or results of operations 
some of these potential losses  which we are aware of  are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
accruals for operating expenses we accrue for property tax expense and other operating expenses based upon estimates and historical trends and current and anticipated local and state government rules and regulations 
if these estimates and assumptions are incorrect  our expenses could be misstated 
overview the self storage industry is highly fragmented and is composed predominantly of numerous local and regional operators 
competition in the markets in which we operate is significant and has increased over the past several years due to additional development of self storage facilities 
we believe that the increase in competition has had a negative impact to our occupancy levels and rental rates in many markets 
however  we believe that we possess several distinguishing characteristics that enable us to compete effectively with other owners and operators 
we are the largest owner and operator of self storage facilities in the united states with ownership interests as of december  in  self storage facilities containing approximately million net rentable square feet 
all of our facilities are operated under the public storage brand name  which we believe is the most recognized and established name in the self storage industry 
located in the major metropolitan markets of states  our self storage facilities are geographically diverse  giving us national recognition and prominence 
this concentration establishes us as one of the dominant providers of storage space in most markets in which we operate and enables us to use a variety of promotional activities  such as television advertising as well as targeted discounting and referrals  which are generally not economically viable to most of our competitors 
in addition  we believe that the geographic diversity of the portfolio reduces the impact from regional economic downturns and provides a greater degree of revenue stability 
we will continue to focus our growth strategies on i improving the operating performance of our existing self storage properties  ii increasing our ownership of self storage facilities  iii improving the operating performance of our containerized storage business  and iv participating in the growth of ps business parks  inc psb 
major elements of these strategies are as follows we will focus on enhancing the operating performance of our self storage properties  primarily through increases in revenues achieved through the telephone reservation center and associated marketing efforts 
however  during  the consistent group of facilities defined below exhibited reductions in rental income and net operating income before depreciation of and  respectively  over the prior year 
we believe that these reductions were attributable to the impact of changes in our marketing strategy as well as to general economic conditions 
see self storage operations consistent group of facilities for further discussion 
we expect future increases in rental income to come from increases in occupancy and increases in realized rent  although there can be no assurance 
we expect to continue our development program  though at a level of development that is lower than that experienced in the last three years 
over the past four years  the company and the consolidated development joint venture has developed and opened a total of storage facilities at a cost of approximately million  containing approximately  net rentable square feet 
we have a total of projects identified for openings after december  at an estimated total cost of million 
these projects are comprised of self storage facilities and expansions of existing self storage facilities 
we will acquire facilities from third parties 
this activity has not contributed significantly to our growth over the past three years  as we have acquired only self storage facilities from third parties 
we believe that our national telephone reservation system and marketing organization present an opportunity for increased revenues through higher occupancies of the properties acquired from third parties  as well as cost efficiencies through greater critical mass 
we will attempt to continue to acquire self storage facilities from affiliates or interests in affiliated entities that own self storage facilities which we manage  as they become available from time to time 
the pool of such available acquisitions has continued to decrease as we have acquired such remaining interests over the last several years 
we will continue to focus on improving the operations of the containerized storage operations 
over the last three years  we have developed facilities that combine containerized storage and traditional self storage 
these facilities have replaced facilities previously leased from third parties  thereby reducing third party lease expense 
during  we identified containerized storage facilities that no longer fit into our business plan going forward 
these facilities have been or will be closed thereby reducing the number of containerized facilities from to facilities 
we continue to evaluate the optimum level of containerized facility operations in each market in which we operate and may close additional facilities during in addition  we continue to refine the operating model of the containerized storage business 
through our investment in psb  we will continue to participate in the growth of this company s investment in approximately million net rentable square feet of commercial space at december  results of operations net income net income was  for compared to  for  representing a decrease of 
the decrease in net income was caused primarily by a decrease in the operating results of our consistent group of self storage properties  increased depreciation expense resulting primarily from new property additions  and charges relating to the planned closure of several containerized storage facilities 
the impact of these items was partially offset by increased earnings generated by the acquisition of additional real estate investments during and  the earnings generated by the tenant reinsurance business that was acquired at the end of  reduced general and administrative expense  and a decrease in income allocated to minority interests 
net income was  for compared to  for  representing an increase of 
the increase was primarily the result of improved operating results of our consistent group self storage properties  reduced operating losses from the containerized storage business and increased earnings generated by the acquisition of additional real estate investments during and the impact of these items was offset partially by an increased allocation of income to minority combined with an increase in depreciation expense during resulting from new property additions during and net income per share net income was per common share  on a diluted basis  for compared to per common share for in addition to those factors denoted above with respect to the reduction in net income in  net income per share  on a diluted basis  decreased due to i an increase in net income allocated to both our preferred and equity stock  series a shareholders and ii an increase in weighted average diluted common shares outstanding 
diluted weighted average common equivalent shares outstanding totaled  for compared to  for net income was per common share  on a diluted basis  for compared to per common share in this increase was due to the same factors denoted above with respect to the increase in net income in combined with a decrease in weighted average shares outstanding due to our common share repurchase activities  offset partially by an increase in net income allocated to both our preferred and equity stock  a shareholders 
diluted weighted average shares outstanding decreased from  in to  in  as a result of the impact of common share repurchases in in computing net income allocable to common shareholders for each period  aggregate dividends paid to the holders of the equity stock  series a and preferred equity securities have been deducted in determining net income allocable to the common shareholders

in  rental income grew to  representing an increase of as compared to the year over year improvements in rental income include changes in the performance of those properties that we owned throughout the three year period and the increase in the number of properties in our portfolio either through our acquisition or development activities 
at the end of  we had a total of  self storage facilities included in our consolidated financial statements 
since that time we have increased the number of self storage facilities by facilities  facilities and facilities 
to enhance year over year comparisons  the following table summarizes  and the ensuing discussion describes  the self storage operating results based upon the following categories i  self storage facilities that are reflected in the financial statements on a stabilized basis for the entire three years ended december  the consistent group  ii development facilities that were opened since january  the developed facilities  iii facilities that were acquired in the three years ended december  the acquired facilities  iv facilities that were owned throughout the three years ended december  but were not stabilized  the expansion facilities  and v one facility that was disposed of during the three years ended december  the disposed facility self storage operations summary year ended december  year ended december  percentage percentage change change dollar amounts in thousands rental income a consistent group b     acquired facilities c     expansion facilities d     developed facilities e     disposed facility f total rental income     cost of operations consistent group     acquired facilities     expansion facilities     developed facilities     disposed facility total cost of operations     net operating income before depreciation consistent group     acquired facilities     expansion facilities     developed facilities    disposed facility total net operating income before depreciation     depreciation     operating income     number of self storage facilities at end of     period net rentable square feet in thousands  at end of period     a rental income includes late charges and administrative fees and is net of promotional discounts given

d the expansion facilities includes facilities containing  net rentable square feet of which  square feet is industrial space developed for containerized storage activities 
these facilities were owned for the entire three year period ending december   however  year over year operating results are not comparable throughout the periods presented due primarily to expansions in their net rentable square or their conversion into combination facilities 
such construction activities can cause a drop in revenue levels  as existing capacity is made unavailable in order to accommodate construction activities 
during the three years ended december   we completed construction on expansion projects with a total cost of million 
e the developed facilities includes facilities containing  net rentable square feet of which  square feet is industrial space for use in containerized storage activities  see containerized storage and discontinued operations 
these facilities were developed and opened since january  at a total cost of million 
f the disposed facility includes one facility that was disposed of during as a result of being condemned by a government agency 
self storage operations consistent group of facilities at december   we owned  self storage facilities that have operated at a stabilized level of operations throughout the three year period 
the consistent group of facilities contains approximately  net rentable square feet  representing approximately of the aggregate net rentable square feet of our self storage portfolio 
revenues and operating expenses with respect to this group of properties are set forth in the above self storage operations table under the caption  consistent group

    a square foot occupancies represent weighted average occupancy levels over the entire fiscal year 
b realized annual rent per occupied square foot is computed by dividing adjusted base rental income by the weighted average occupied square footage for the year 
realized rents per square foot take into consideration promotional discounts  bad debt costs  credit card fees and other costs which reduce rental income from the contractual amounts due 
c annualized revenue per available square foot represents adjusted base rental income divided by total available net rentable square feet 
d in place annual rent per occupied square foot represents contractual rents per occupied square foot without reductions for promotional discounts 
e posted annual rent per square foot represents the rents charged to new tenants prior to any promotional discounts 
the consistent group s operating income increased in as compared to the consistent group s net operating income before depreciation increased in as compared to  with rental income increasing and cost of operations increasing 
the increase in rental income was primarily the result of higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot for as compared to for  representing an increase of  offset partially by a reduction in weighted average occupancy levels from in to in  representing a reduction in average occupancy 
the increase in cost of operations was due to increases in promotional and advertising expenses 
the consistent group s operating income decreased in as compared to the consistent group s net operating income before depreciation decreased in as compared to  with rental income decreasing and cost of operations increasing 
the decrease in rental income was primarily the result of lower average occupancy levels which decreased from in to in  representing a decrease  offset partially by higher realized annual rent per occupied square foot for fiscal compared to for fiscal  representing an increase of 
the increase in cost of operations was due primarily to increases in payroll  cost of managing facilities  and property taxes 
we attribute the decrease in operating income in primarily to a change in our operating strategy during and secondarily to increased competition and economic factors  though we are not able to quantify the relative impact of each of these factors 
historically  our marketing strategy was to offer a variety of promotional discounts and to conservatively price our space to attract new tenants 
during  the consistent group s occupancy levels averaged 
this relatively high occupancy level was attained and sustained through a variety of promotional activities offering new tenants move in promotional discounts aggregating million in this annual level of discounts was consistent with those given in years prior to in  we changed our marketing strategy and began to aggressively increase rental rates and reduce the amount of promotional discounts offered to new tenants 
we believed that this strategy had the benefit of significantly increasing our rental income  with the potential risk of lowering occupancy levels 
during the first nine months of  this strategy significantly enhanced the growth in our rental income  which for the first nine months of was approximately higher than for the same period in the downside to our more aggressive strategy was that our average occupancy levels during the first nine months of were approximately below the level experienced during the same period in we believed that the decrease in occupancy levels was a manageable reduction and was more than offset by the increase in rental income attained through higher rental rates and less promotional discounting 
during the fourth quarter of  there was a rapid decline in our occupancy levels 
this reduction coincided with a reduction in call volume into our national telephone reservation center which we believe was attributable to the absence of any significant promotional discounts offered to tenants as well as to general economic conditions 
in addition  during this time frame we also experienced unusually high levels of move out activity 
at september   the average occupancy level of the consistent group of facilities was compared to one year earlier  representing a reduction of 
three months later  at december   the average occupancy level of the consistent group of facilities was compared to one year earlier  representing a reduction of 
accordingly  the year over year negative spread in occupancy levels widened significantly from september  through december  although we were very pleased with the rental growth experienced in fiscal  we were very concerned about the sudden and rapid decline in our occupancy levels experienced in the fourth quarter of this decline in occupancy levels continued into fiscal as our average occupancy levels decreased to at the end of february compared to one year earlier  representing a reduction of 
in the second half of march  in order to enhance move in activity  we significantly reduced rental rates charged to new incoming tenants and began a national television advertising campaign that offered a significant promotional discount to new move ins 
the advertising campaign was run from the second half of march through the first half of may the campaign resulted in increased move in activity during april and may compared to the same period in the prior year and helped us improve occupancy levels 
the months of may through july are seasonally high rental activity months  accordingly  in the middle of may we terminated the advertising campaign and discontinued promotional discounts 
unfortunately  we underestimated the weakness in demand and in the absence of significant promotional discounts  rental activity during june and july decreased as compared to the same periods in consequently  our average occupancy levels for the consistent group of facilities continued to decline relative to the occupancies experienced in at the end of july  our occupancy levels were as compared to at the end of july  representing a reduction of 
beginning in mid august and through the remainder of the year  we reinstated a promotional discount program and advertised on television in selected markets in an effort to enhance move in activity and improve occupancy levels 
this program had a positive impact upon move in activity throughout the third and fourth quarters and helped stabilize our occupancy levels 
by december   the reduction in the year over year occupancy levels was reduced to at december  compared to at december  from the year over year reduction that was experienced at july  stabilizing our occupancy levels during came with a significant price 
promotional discounts increased from approximately  in to  in  resulting in a negative impact to our rental income 
in hindsight  the aggressive rental rates and lack of promotional discounts that produced a increase in our net operating income in as compared to  put significant pressure on our occupancy levels during in order to reestablish our occupancy levels  we had to revert back to a marketing program that has worked in the past  namely reasonable rental rates combined with a promotional discount program 
in the process of reestablishing our occupancy levels during  we incurred significant cost relative to these costs came in the form of higher discounts given and increased costs associated with advertising on television  resulting in a significant adverse impact to our comparative operating results 
during  we expect to continue promotional discounting and television advertising  though the level of such activities cannot be estimated at this time 
the up front costs of these marketing activities  and the increases in discounts  are expected to continue to adversely impact our operating income during the following table sets forth our rental income  cost of television advertising  promotional discounts given  and average occupancies for each of the quarters in  and for the quarter ended march june september december entire year amounts in thousands total rental income television advertising promotional discounts given weighted average occupancy during the first two months of  our occupancy levels  continued to improve 
the weighted average occupancy level for our consistent group of facilities was at february  as compared to at february   representing an increase of 
this increase  however  has come at a significant cost 
television advertising for the two months ended february  was  as compared to  for the same period in promotional discounts for the two months ended february  were  as compared to only  for the same period in therefore  despite the increase in average physical occupancy  net operating income for our consistent group facilities was lower in the two months ended february  as compared to the same period in we are continuously evaluating our call volume  reservation activity  and move in move out rates for each of our markets relative to our marketing activities and rental rates 
in addition  we are evaluating market supply and demand factors and based upon these analyses we are continuing to adjust our marketing activities in an effort to increase our occupancy levels and ultimately our rental income 
cost of operations cost of operations increased approximately in as compared to cost of managing facilities principally includes payroll related to supervisory personnel combined with associated overhead costs 
cost of managing facilities and direct property payroll have increased and  respectively  in compared to these increases are principally due to adjustments to incentive compensation programs that will continue to have an impact in repairs and maintenance cost has consistently been reduced since  however  we do not anticipate this trend to continue into we anticipate increased repair and maintenance costs as a result of heavy snow in the northeastern states and costs to remedy mold issues at several facilities in southern states 
we also expect that property taxes will continue to increase into fiscal cost of operations for increased approximately as compared to advertising and promotion costs  which principally includes television and yellow page advertising cost  increased in television advertising cost was approximately  in compared to only  in yellow page advertising cost was  in compared to  in promotional advertising is an important part of our operational strategy 
our advertising activities have increased customer call volume into our national reservation system  where one of our representatives discusses with the customer space requirements  price and location preferences and also informs the customer of other products and services provided by the company and its subsidiaries 
during  we closed our telephone reservation center in texas and aggregated all the call volume into a single center in california 
as a result of the closure  telephone reservation costs decreased from million in to million in the following table sets forth regional trends in our consistent group of facilities with respect to rental income  cost of operations  net operating income  weighted average occupancy levels  and realized rent per net rentable square foot

the acquisitions include properties acquired from affiliated entities  including properties acquired on january  from an affiliated development joint venture and properties acquired on january  in connection with business combinations with two affiliated partnerships see note to the consolidated financial statements 
the acquisition includes one facility acquired from a third party 
the acquisitions include facilities acquired in business combinations  facilities acquired from entities in which we had an interest  and facilities acquired from third parties 
similar to our consistent group of facilities  the acquired facilities have experienced operating difficulties over the past year 
marketing and promotional strategies  as described above with respect to our consistent group  were employed in  and will continued to be employed in to enhance occupancy levels and rental income in of the acquired facilities 
self storage operations expansion facilities throughout the three year period ended december   we expanded self storage facilities or converted them to combination facilities 
these activities caused a drop in revenue levels  as existing capacity was made unavailable in order to accommodate construction activities 
accordingly  the operating results are not comparable in each of the three years ended december  at december   the weighted average occupancy level were approximately as compared to one year earlier 
the operating results for these facilities are presented in the self storage operations table above under the caption  expansion facilities 
depreciation expense with respect to the expansion facilities was  in   in and  in the increases in depreciation expense are due to the opening of the expanded facilities

accordingly  at the time a newly developed facility first opens for operation the facility is entirely vacant generating no rental income 
historically  we estimated that on average it took approximately months for a newly developed facility to fill up and reach a targeted occupancy level of approximately 
we believe that the current economic environment has extended the fill up period beyond months notwithstanding our marketing efforts to enhance the fill up process 
similar to our consistent group of facilities  the newly developed self storage facilities participated in promotional discounting and advertising activities to enhance occupancy levels 
during  the newly developed facilities had a weighted average occupancy level of approximately 
property operating expenses are substantially fixed  consisting primarily of payroll  property taxes  utilities  and marketing costs 
the rental revenue of a newly developed facility will generally not cover its property operating expenses excluding depreciation until the facility has reach an occupancy level of approximately to 
however  at that occupancy level  the rental revenues from the facility are still not sufficient to cover related depreciation expense and cost of capital with respect to the facility s development cost 
during construction of the self storage facility  we capitalize interest costs and include such cost as part of the overall development cost of the facility 
once the facility is opened for operations interest is no longer capitalized 
due to the relationship between the generation of rental income and immediate recognition of expenses upon opening of a facility  our development activities have had a negative impact on our net income 
we estimate that our net income has been negatively impacted by approximately   and  in the years ended december    and  respectively  as a result of the difference between the revenues generated by the developed facilities and the related operating costs denoted above 
these amounts include approximately   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively  in depreciation expense 
we continue to develop facilities  despite the short term earnings dilution experienced during the fill up period  because we believe that the ultimate returns on developed facilities are favorable 
in addition  we believe that it is advantageous for us to continue to expand our asset base and benefit from the resultant increased critical mass  with facilities that will improve our portfolio s overall average construction and location quality 
we expect that over at least the next months  the developed facilities will continue to have a negative impact to our earnings  however  to a much lesser degree than experienced in furthermore  the expansion and newly developed facilities in our development pipeline described in liquidity and capital resources acquisition and development of facilities that will be opened for operation over the next months will also negatively impact our earnings until they reach a stabilized occupancy level 
commercial property operations commercial property operations included in our consolidated financial statements include commercial space owned by the company and entities consolidated by the company 
we have a much larger interest in commercial properties through our ownership interest in psb 
our investment in psb is accounted for on the equity method of accounting  and accordingly our share of psb s earnings is reflected as equity in earnings of real estate entities  see below 
our commercial operations are comprised of  net rentable commercial space operated at certain of the self storage facilities and three stand alone commercial facilities having a total of  net rentable square feet 
in addition  we own an industrial building with  net rentable square feet that was opened in at a total cost of  this facility was previously used by our containerized storage operations and is currently being evaluated for repurposing or disposition

at december   pspud operated facilities in states  which are located in major markets in which we have significant market presence with respect to our traditional self storage facilities 
the operations with respect to the closed facilities  including historical operating results for previous periods  are not included in the table below and instead are included in discontinued operations

rental income increased to  in as compared to  in as a result of higher per container rents and an increase in the number of occupied containers 
at december   there were approximately  occupied containers in the facilities that are reflected in ongoing operations 
we continue to evaluate the business operations and additional facilities may be closed

over the past three years  facility lease expense has continued to decrease  in   in and  in 
the reduction over the past three years is principally the result of moving the operations from leased facilities to wholly owned facilities  and thus eliminating the lease expense paid to third parties 
at december   nine of the containerized storage facilities are leased from third parties 
the remaining facilities were operated in facilities owned by the company  comprised of combination facilities with an aggregate of  square feet of industrial space this square footage is a component of the total net rentable square footage of the expansion facilities and the developed facilities in the table above and five industrial facilities having an aggregate of  net rentable square feet 
the containerized storage operations may continue to adversely impact our future earnings and cash flows 
there can be no assurance as to the level of the containerized storage business s expansion  level of gross rentals  level of move outs or profitability 
see discontinued operations below for a discussion of operating results of the closed facilities 
tenant reinsurance operations on december   we acquired ps insurance company  ltd 
ps insurance from a related party 
ps insurance reinsures policies against losses to goods stored by tenants in our self storage facilities 
effective january   the operations of ps insurance are included in the income statement under revenues tenant reinsurance premiums and cost of operations tenant reinsurance 
the tenant reinsurance business earned  in revenues for the year ended december  and incurred  in operating expenses  generating a net operating profit of the level of tenant reinsurance revenues is largely dependent upon our occupancy level and move in activity 
as of december   approximately of our self storage tenant base have such policies

we have outside third party insurance coverage for losses from any individual event that exceeds a loss of  to a limit of  losses below these amounts are recorded as cost of operations for the tenant reinsurance operations 
equity in earnings of real estate entities in addition to our ownership of equity interests in psb  we had general and limited partnership interests in seven limited partnerships at december  psb and the limited partnerships are collectively referred to as the unconsolidated entities 
due to our limited ownership interest and limited control of these entities  we do not consolidate the accounts of these entities for financial reporting purposes  and account for such investments using the equity method 
equity in earnings of real estate entities for the year ended december  consists of our pro rata share of the unconsolidated entities based upon our ownership interest for the period

the decrease in equity in earnings of real estate entities when comparing to  is caused by the consolidation of the development joint venture and two additional partnerships as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  partially offset by our pro rata share of psb s gain on sale of real estate investments totaling  for equity in earnings of psb represents our pro rata share approximately at december  of the earnings of ps business parks  inc  a publicly traded real estate investment trust american stock exchange symbol psb organized by the company on january  as of december   we owned  common shares and  operating partnership units units which are convertible into common shares on a one for one basis in psb

psb also manages approximately  net rentable square feet of commercial space owned by the company and affiliated entities at december  pursuant to property management agreements 
accordingly  our future equity income from psb will be dependent entirely upon psb s operating results

equity in earnings of entities that we either no longer hold at december   or which were consolidated in the three years ended december   are included in the line item newly consolidated and disposed investments 
on january   we acquired the remaining ownership interest in the development joint venture for cash totaling approximately  as a result  we began consolidating the operating results of the development joint venture and no further equity in earnings will be recorded with respect to this entity for periods after january  effective january  see note to the financial statements  we began consolidating the operating results of two other partnerships and no longer record equity in these entity s earnings with respect to our investments in these partnerships 
effective september   we acquired the interest we didn t own in a partnership owning real estate facilities for an aggregate of  and began consolidating the operating results of this entity 
during  we disposed of an investment in a publicly held real estate investment trust for an aggregate of  our earnings with respect our interests in these entities are included in the table above in the line acquired partnerships 
no further equity in earnings will be recorded with respect to these entities for periods after their respective dates of consolidation or disposal 
the other investments includes our equity in earnings with respect to our pro rata share of earnings with respect to seven limited partnerships  for which we held an approximately consistent level of equity interest during the three years ended december  these limited partnerships were formed by the company during the s 
the company is the general partner in each limited partnership  and manages each of these facilities for a management fee that is included in interest and other income 
the limited partners consist of numerous individual investors  including the company  which throughout the s acquired units of limited partnership interests in these limited partnerships in various transactions 
our future earnings with respect to the other investments will be dependent upon the operating results of the self storage facilities that these entities own 
the operating characteristics of these facilities are similar to those of the company s self storage facilities  and are subject to the same operational issues as the consistent group of self storage facilities as discussed above with respect to self storage operations 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for the operating results of these entities for the years ended december  and 
other income and expense items interest and other income interest in other income includes i the net operating results from our third party property management operations  ii the net operating results from our merchandise sales and consumer truck rentals and iii interest income 
interest and other income has decreased in as compared to principally as a result of lower cash balances invested in interest bearing accounts  lower interest rates  and the reduction in income generated from affiliated entities that were acquired by the company 
interest and other income has increased in as compared to principally as a result of higher average cash balances invested in interest bearing accounts and the aforementioned nonrecurring other income recorded in the changes in average cash balances are primarily due to the timing of investing proceeds from the issuance of equity securities into real estate assets 
depreciation and amortization depreciation and amortization expense was  in   in and  in included in depreciation expense with respect to our real estate facilities was  in   in and  in  the increases are due to the acquisition and development of additional real estate facilities in through depreciation expense with respect to other assets  primarily depreciation of equipment and containers associated with the containerized storage operations  was  in   in and  in amortization expense with respect to intangible assets totaled  for the year ended december  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
depreciation and amortization during with respect to real estate facilities acquired or developed during amounted to  which was for a partial period for the time they were acquired until december   and we expect the annual depreciation expense with respect to these facilities for and forward will approximate  general and administrative expense general and administrative expense was  in   in and  in general and administrative costs for each year principally consist of state income taxes  investor relation expenses  and corporate and executive salaries 
in addition  general and administrative expense includes expenses that vary depending upon the company s activity levels in certain areas  such as overhead associated with the acquisition and development of real estate facilities  employee severance  and product research and development expenditures 
during and  we incurred higher levels of expenditures for product research  development overhead  consulting fees  lease termination costs relating to our pspud business and employee severance costs 
such costs totaled approximately  in and  in the reduction in general and administrative expense during was largely due to the reduction in these types of expenditures 
we expect that the level of general and administrative expense in will approximate that experienced in interest expense interest expense was  in   in and  in debt and related interest expense remain relatively low compared to our overall asset base 
the increase in interest expense in compared to and is principally the result of decreased capitalized interest 
capitalized interest expense totaled  in   in and  in in connection with our development activities 
the combined interest expense and capitalized interest was  in   in and  in we expect that our aggregate interest cost interest expensed and capitalized interest combined during fiscal will continue to decline as a result of principal amortization 
during fiscal  scheduled principal amortization approximates million 
the amount of interest which will be capitalized during fiscal will be dependent on our development activities which we believe will be lower than what was incurred during minority interest in income minority interest in income represents the income allocable to equity interests in consolidated entities  which are not owned by the company

on march  the partnership issued million of series o cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units and on august   issued million of series p cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units 
in august  we repurchased  at par  million of series o cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units 
in october  we repurchased  at par  million of series p cumulative redeemable perpetual preferred units 
for the years ended december    and  the holders of our preferred partnership units were paid in aggregate approximately   and  respectively  in distributions and received a corresponding allocation of minority interest in earnings for the respective period 
we estimate that during we will pay aggregate distributions totaling million to these units with a corresponding allocation of income to minority interest in earnings 
in november  we formed a development joint venture the consolidated development joint venture with a joint venture partner whose partners include an institutional investor and the company s chairman and former ceo  b 
wayne hughes mr 
hughes 
the consolidated development joint venture is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from the company and from the joint venture partner 
included in minority interest in income for the years ended december    and is   and  respectively  representing our joint venture partner s pro rata interest in the operations of the consolidated development joint venture 
the facilities in the entity are newly developed facilities that are all in the fill up phase 
the increase in minority interest in income in and as compared to the preceding years with respect to the consolidated development joint venture is due to the opening and fill up of the facilities owned by this entity 
we expect that such minority interest in income will continue to increase during as the facilities continue to fill up and increase the earnings of this entity 
newly consolidated partnerships reflect the minority interests in two partnerships that we began consolidating effective january   as described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  as described in note  during we recorded the pending sale of a partnership interest in the newly consolidated partnerships  and for all periods following the sale of this interest  income will be allocated to these interests 
the acquired minority interests reflect interests in the consolidated entities that the company acquired in the three years ended december  and are therefore no longer outstanding 
there will be no further income allocated to these interests in and beyond 
other minority interests reflect income allocated to minority interests that have maintained a consistent level of interest throughout the three years ended december   comprised of investments in the consolidated entities and the operating partnership units described in note to the company s financial statements 
the level of income allocated to these interests in the future is dependent upon the operating results of the storage facilities that these entities own  as well as any acquisitions of minority interests that the company does in the future 
we recently mailed an information statement relating to the april  acquisition by the company of all of the remaining limited partnership interest not currently owned by the company in ps partners iv  ltd  a partnership which is consolidated with the company  for an aggregate of  included in minority interest in income for the year ended december   with respect to these interests was approximately  including  in depreciation expense 
if completed  the transaction would have the effect of reducing minority interest in income on a go forward basis 
see acquisition and development of facilities below 
discontinued operations as described more fully in the note to the consolidated financial statements  we implemented a business plan which included the closure of certain non strategic containerized storage facilities the closed facilities 
also  we sold one of our commercial facilities to a third party for an aggregate million in cash 
during  in connection with the closure or planned closure of these facilities  we recorded asset impairment losses with respect to the furniture  fixtures  and equipment totaling  in addition  lease termination costs for the expected remaining lease liability following closure of the facilities were recorded in the amount of  the historical operations of the closed facilities including the asset impairment losses and lease termination costs are classified as discontinued operations  with the rental income  cost of operations  and depreciation expense with respect to these facilities for current and prior periods included in the line item discontinued operations on the income statement

many of the closed facilities are in the process of closing which may take up to several months to complete 
we expect that these facilities will continue to generate operating losses until final closure 
gain loss in disposition of real estate in the year ended december   we recorded a net loss on disposition of real estate of  as compared to a gain of  and  respectively  in and the net loss in is composed of a loss on disposition of land and a commercial facility totaling  as described in note  combined with a loss on disposition of partnership interests in the amount of  as described in note the gain in is related to the disposition of two real estate facilities and a parcel of land 
the gain in is composed a  gain on the sale of eight storage facilities and two parcels of land  and a  gain on the sale of investments 
liquidity and capital resources we believe that our internally generated net cash provided by operating activities will continue to be sufficient to enable us to meet our operating expenses  capital improvements  debt service requirements and distributions to shareholders for the foreseeable future 
operating as a real estate investment trust reit  our ability to retain cash flow for reinvestment is restricted 
in order for us to maintain our reit status  a substantial portion of our operating cash flow must be used to make distributions to our shareholders see requirement to pay distributions below 
however  despite the significant distribution requirements  we have been able to retain a significant amount of our operating cash flow 
the following table summarizes our ability to fund distributions to the minority interest  capital improvements to maintain our facilities  and distributions to our shareholders through the use of cash provided by operating activities 
the remaining cash flow generated is available to make both scheduled and optional principal payments on debt and for reinvestment 
for the year ended december  amount in thousands net cash provided by operating activities    allocable to minority interests preferred units    allocable to minority interests common equity    cash from operations allocable to our shareholders    capital improvements to maintain our facilities storage facilities    commercial properties   add back minority interest share of capital improvements to maintain facilities  remaining operating cash flow available for distributions to our    shareholders distributions paid preferred stock dividends    equity stock  series a dividends    regular distributions to common and class b shareholders    special distributions to common and class b shareholders a   cash available for principal payments on debt and reinvestment    a the special distribution for was declared in august and paid in september the special distribution for was declared in august and paid in september in each instance  the special distribution enabled the company to maintain its reit status with respect to the distribution requirements 
our financial profile is characterized by a low level of debt to total capitalization  increasing net income  increasing cash flow from operations  and a conservative dividend payout ratio with respect to the common stock 
we expect to fund our growth strategies with cash on hand at december   internally generated retained cash flows  and proceeds from issuing equity securities 
in general  our current strategy is to continue to finance our growth with permanent capital  either common or preferred equity 
we have in the past used our million line of credit as temporary bridge financing  and repaid those amounts with internally generated cash flows and proceeds from the placement of permanent capital 
as of december   we had no outstanding borrowings under our million bank line of credit 
over the past three years we have funded substantially all of our acquisitions with permanent capital both common and preferred securities 
we have elected to use preferred securities as a form of leverage despite the fact that the dividend rates of our preferred securities exceed the prevailing market interest rates on conventional debt 
we have chosen this method of financing for the following reasons i under the reit structure  a significant amount of operating cash flow needs to be distributed to our shareholders making it difficult to repay debt with operating cash flow alone  ii our perpetual preferred stock has no sinking fund requirement  or maturity date and does not require redemption  all of which eliminate any future refinancing risks  iii after the end of a non call period  we have the option to redeem the preferred stock at any time  which in and enabled us to effectively refinance higher coupon preferred stock with new preferred stock at lower rates  iv preferred stock does not contain onerous covenants  thus allowing us to maintain significant financial flexibility  and v dividends on the preferred stock can be applied to our reit distribution requirements 
our credit ratings on each of our series of cumulative preferred stock by each of the three major credit agencies are baa by moody s and bbb by both standard poor s and fitch ibca 
our portfolio of real estate facilities remains substantially unencumbered 
at december   we had mortgage debt outstanding of million which encumbers real estate with a book value of million and unsecured debt in the amount of million  and real estate facilities with a book value of approximately billion 
we believe that our size and financial flexibility enables us to access capital when appropriate

accordingly  at our option  we redeemed for cash our cumulative preferred stock series g  series h  series i in and series a and series j in  each having higher coupon rates than either the series r  series s or series v 
in addition  during we repurchased all of our outstanding series p partnership preferred units and a portion of our outstanding series o partnership preferred units

requirement to pay distributions we have operated  and intend to continue to operate  in such a manner as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code of  but no assurance can be given that we will at all times so qualify 
to the extent that the company continues to qualify as a reit  we will not be taxed  with certain limited exceptions  on the taxable income that is distributed to our shareholders  provided that at least of our taxable income is so distributed to our shareholders prior to filing of the company s tax return 
we have satisfied the reit distribution requirement since aggregate dividends paid during  totaled million to the holders of our cumulative preferred stock  million to the holders of our common stock  million to the holders of our class b common stock and million to the holders of our equity stock  series a 
although we have not finalized the calculation of our taxable income  we believe that the aggregate dividends paid in to our shareholders were designed to enable us to continue to qualify as a reit 
we estimate that the distribution requirements for fiscal with respect to our cumulative preferred stock outstanding  and assuming the redemption of cumulative preferred stock  series b  will be approximately million 
during  we paid distributions totaling million with respect to our preferred partnership units 
we estimate the annual distributions requirements with respect to the preferred partnership units outstanding at december  to be approximately million 
for  distributions with respect to the common stock and equity stock  series a will be determined based upon our reit distribution requirements after taking into consideration distributions to the preferred shareholders 
we anticipate that  at a minimum  quarterly distributions per common share will remain at per common share increased from per common share during and in the first two quarters of 
for the first quarter of  a quarterly distribution of per common share has been declared by our board of directors 
prior to  in addition to the regular quarterly dividends paid to our common shareholder  we also paid special distributions 
these special distributions were necessary to meet our distribution requirements in order to maintain our reit tax status 
while we don t expect to need a special distribution in  the need to make a special distribution is not determinable at this time and will depend in large part on our taxable income relative to the distributions being paid to all of our shareholders 
with respect to the depositary shares of equity stock  series a  we have no obligation to pay distributions if no distributions are paid to the common shareholders 
to the extent that we do pay common distributions in any year  the holders of the depositary shares receive annual distributions equal to the lesser of i five times the per share dividend on the common stock or ii 
the depositary shares are noncumulative  and have no preference over our common stock either as to dividends or in liquidation 
capital improvement requirements during  we have budgeted approximately million for capital improvements 
capital improvements include major repairs or replacements to the facilities which keep the facilities in good operation condition and maintain their visual appeal 
capital improvements do not include costs relating to the development or expansion of facilities 
debt service requirements we do not believe we have any significant refinancing risks with respect to our mortgage debt  all of which is fixed rate 
at december   we had total outstanding notes payable of approximately million 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for approximate principal maturities of such borrowings 
we anticipate that our retained operating cash flow will continue to be sufficient to enable us to make scheduled principal payments 
it is our current intent to fully amortize our debt as opposed to refinance debt maturities with additional debt 
acquisition and development of facilities during  we acquired nine self storage facilities for approximately million 
during  we acquired one self storage facility for approximately million 
during  we acquired a commercial facility and storage facilities at an aggregate cost of approximately million 
our low level of third party acquisitions over the past three years is not indicative of either the supply of facilities offered for sale or our ability to finance the acquisitions  but is primarily due to prices sought by sellers and our lack of desire to pay such prices 
during fiscal  we will continue to seek to acquire additional self storage facilities from third parties  however  it is difficult to estimate the amount of third party acquisitions we will undertake 
on january   we acquired the remaining interest in the development joint venture for approximately  in cash 
the development joint venture was formed in april with equity capital consisting of from the company and from an institutional investor  which owns storage facilities opened since this transaction was principally financed with the capital raised through the issuance of our cumulative preferred stock  series t 
on april   we acquired through a merger all of the remaining limited partnership interest not currently owned by the company in ps partners v  ltd  a partnership which is consolidated with the company 
the acquisition cost consisted of approximately  shares  of our common stock and approximately  in cash 
on september   we acquired through a merger all of the remaining limited partnership interest not currently owned by the company in ps partners vi  ltd  a partnership which is consolidated with the company 
the acquisition cost consisted of approximately  shares  of our common stock and approximately  in cash 
on september   we acquired the remaining ownership interests in an affiliated partnership  of which we were the general partner  for an aggregate acquisition cost of million 
this partnership owned self storage facilities 
we recently mailed an information statement relating to the april  acquisition by the company of all of the  limited partnership units that it did not own in ps partners iv  ltd  a partnership which is consolidated with the company 
the acquisition of the  units will be accomplished through a merger of a subsidiary of the company into the partnership and the conversion of the  units into either cash or common stock of the company 
each unit will be converted into the right to receive a value of in our common stock or  at the election of the unitholder  in cash 
we expect that the cash portion of the transaction will be funded by available cash on hand or  if necessary  borrowings on our line of credit 
in november  we formed a second joint venture partnership for the development of approximately million of self storage facilities 
the venture is funded solely with equity capital consisting of from us and from the joint venture partner 
the term of the joint venture is years 
after six years  the joint venture partner has the right to cause the company to purchase the joint venture partner s interest for an amount necessary to provide them with a maximum return of or less in certain circumstances 
at december   this development joint venture was fully committed having developed facilities approximately  net rentable sq 
ft 
for million 
we currently have a development pipeline of self storage facilities  combination facilities  and expansions to existing self storage facilities with an aggregate estimated cost of approximately million 
approximately million of development cost has been incurred as of december  we have acquired the land for of these projects  which have an aggregate estimated cost of approximately million  and costs incurred as of december  of approximately million 
the remaining facilities represent identified sites where we have an agreement in place to acquire the land  generally within one year 
we anticipate that the development of these projects will be funded solely by the company 
the development and fill up of these storage facilities is subject to significant contingencies such as obtaining appropriate governmental approvals 
we estimate that the amount remaining to be spent of approximately million will be incurred over the next months
