as a result of this acquisition  we added products and over  associates 
critical accounting policies 
we prepare our consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the year 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we consider the following policies to be most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our financial statements and the uncertainties that could impact our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
throughout this report  net sales represents the gross sales amounts reflected on our invoices to our associates less associate discounts  sales returns  and freight income 
beginning june   we adopted a new billing policy  which requires billing customers a portion of freight costs  which is included in net sales 
all of our products include a customer satisfaction guarantee 
our products may be returned within days of purchase for a full refund or credit toward the purchase of another product 
we also have a buy back program whereby we repurchase products sold to an independent associate subject to a restocking fee  provided the associate terminates his her associateship agreement with us and returns the product within months of original purchase in marketable condition 
we receive our net sales price in cash or through credit card payments upon receipt of orders from associates 
our gross profit consists of net sales less commissions and bonuses  consisting of commission payments to associates based on their current associate level within their organization  and other one time incentive cash bonuses to qualifying associates  cost of products  consisting of the prices we pay to our manufacturers for products and royalty overrides earned by qualifying associates on sales within their associate organizations  and cost of shipping  consisting of costs related to shipments  duties and tariffs  freight expenses relating to shipment of products to associates  and similar expenses 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products  training aids and promotional material to the independent associates 
all of our customers pay for sales in advance of shipment 
as such  we have no trade receivables 
loans to associates are repayable in five years or less  are secured by commissions controlled by us  and are no longer allowed 
interest rates on loans are typically two percent or more above the prime rate and are fixed 
all loans and receivables are secured by guaranteed payment sources that are within our control 
as such  management believes there is no need for an allowance for doubtful accounts 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this standard requires companies to stop amortizing existing goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives effective january  under the new rules  companies would only adjust the carrying amount of goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets upon an impairment of the goodwill or indefinite life intangible assets 
we implemented these standards effective january  based on an evaluation of goodwill at october   we determined that goodwill of approximately  was impaired and should be written off in its entirety 
we write down our inventory to provide for estimated obsolete or unsalable inventory based on assumptions about future demand for our products and market conditions 
if future demand and market conditions are less favorable than management s assumptions  additional inventory write downs could be required 
likewise  favorable future demand and market conditions could positively impact future operating results if written off inventory is sold 
we account for contingencies in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for contingencies 
sfas requires that we record an estimated loss from a loss contingency when information available prior to issuance of our financial statements indicates that it is probable than an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements and the amount of the loss can be reasonable estimated 
accounting for contingencies such as legal and income tax matters requires us to use our judgment 
many legal and tax contingencies can take years to resolve 
generally  as the time period increases over which the uncertainties are resolved  the likelihood of changes to the estimate of the ultimate outcome increases 
however  an adverse outcome in these matters could have a material impact on our results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
units offering 
on november   we completed the offering of  units  each consisting of one share of common stock and one redeemable common stock purchase warrant 
as a result of this offering  we received proceeds of  each redeemable common stock purchase warrant is exercisable for the purchase of one share of our common stock for on or before november  in connection with this offering  we sold to the underwriters  paulson investment company  inc and joseph charles assoc  inc  warrants exercisable for the purchase of  units for per unit on or before november  on september   we extended the exercise period for the redeemable stock purchase warrants and the underwriter warrants from november  to november  warrant modification offering and rights offering 
in january  we distributed non transferable rights to our common stock shareholders 
these rights entitled the holders to subscribe for and purchase up to  units  each unit consisting of one share of our common stock and one a warrant  for the price of per unit 
concurrently  we called and redeemed our outstanding class a and class b common stock purchase warrants for 
per warrant on march  however  in connection with the warrant redemption  we offered to the holders of the class a and class b warrants the right to purchase units  each comprised of one share of common stock and one a warrant  at an exercise price of per unit 
each a warrant is exercisable on or before november   to purchase one share of common stock for  subject to adjustment in certain events 
we may redeem the a warrants at any time upon days notice  at a price of 
per a warrant 
on september   we extended the exercise period for the a warrants from november  to november  we received proceeds from these two offerings of  accumulated offering costs of  were charged against the net proceeds from these offerings 
pursuant to these offerings we issued  shares of common stock and the same number of a warrants 
associate stock purchase plan 
we registered  stock purchase plan participation interests in the advantage marketing systems  inc associate stock purchase plan 
the participation interests are offered to the associates of our products and services in lots of five participation interests 
a participant in this plan is entitled through purchase of the participation interests to purchase in the open market through the plan  shares of our common stock 
the participation interests are non transferable 
other than an annual service fee of per participant and a transaction fee of per month  we do not receive any proceeds from the purchase of the common stock by the plan 
the offering price of each participation interest is  and each participant is initially required to purchase a minimum of participation interests

accounting standards to be adopted in april  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
and technical corrections  that  among other things  rescinded sfas no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt 
with the rescission of sfas no 
 the early extinguishments of debt generally will no longer be classified as an extraordinary item for financial statement presentation purposes 
the provision is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which replaces emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the new standard required companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
the statement is to be applied prospectively to exit or disposal activities initiated after december  we do not anticipate that the adoption of sfas no 
will have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amended sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation 
the new standard provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
additionally  the statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in the annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used in reported results 
this statement is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december  in compliance with sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to follow the intrinsic value method in accounting for our stock based employee compensation arrangement as defined by apb no 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  or fin for a guarantee subject to fasb interpretation no 
 a guarantor is required to measure and recognize the fair value of the guarantee liability at inception 
for many guarantees  fair value will likely be determined using the expected present value method described fasb concepts statement  using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements 
in addition  fin provides new disclosure requirements 
we adopted the disclosure requirements of fin as of december  the measurement and liability recognition provisions are applied prospectively to guarantees or modifications after december  we anticipate that fin will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin subject to certain criteria defined in the interpretation  fin will require consolidation by business enterprises of variable interest entities if the enterprise has a variable interest that will absorb the majority of the entity s expected losses  receive the majority of it s expected returns  or both 
the provisions of fin are effective immediately for interests acquired in variable interest entities after january   and at the beginning of the first interim or annual period beginning after june   for interests acquired in variable interest entities before february  we will adopt fin in the third quarter of certain disclosures concerning variable interest entities are required in financial statements initially issued after january  we are evaluating the effect of fin but do not believe fin will have a material impact on our financial statements 
commitments and contingencies recent regulatory developments a significant portion of our net sales continues to be dependent upon our am product 
our net sales of am represented and of net sales for the years ended december  and one of the ingredients in our am products is ephedra  an herb that contains naturally occurring ephedrine 
our manufacturer uses a powdered extract of that herb when manufacturing am we market am principally as an aid in weight management 
the extract is an extract  which means that every milligrams of the powdered extract contains approximately eight milligrams of naturally occurring ephedrine alkaloids 
in addition  our sine eze product  used as a food supplement to relieve symptoms associated with allergies  contains ephedrine alkaloids 
ephedrine containing products have been the subject of adverse publicity in the united states and other countries relating to alleged harmful effects 
the fda published a proposed rule in the federal register on june   which proposed significant limitations on the sale of ephedrine containing dietary supplements 
the proposed rule would have significantly limited our ability to sell products containing ephedra if it had been made effective 
on april   the fda withdrew most of the provisions of its proposed rule 
this action was prompted largely by a report issued by the united states general accounting office  or gao  in which the gao criticized the scientific basis for the proposed rule and the fda s evaluation of approximately reports of adverse events supposedly related to the consumption of dietary supplements containing ephedrine alkaloids 
the fda has made available for public inspection most of these adverse event reports 
on march   the fda published a notice in the federal register  which indicates that it will be taking final action on the proposed rule in the near future 
the fda re opened the public comment period  until april   to allow for additional public input on the two proposed limitations on the sale of ephedrine containing dietary supplements that remained after the fda s action of april  one proposed limitation is a warning that would be required to appear on the label of all ephedrine containing supplements 
the other proposed limitation is that ephedrine containing supplements may not contain other substances that are known to have stimulant effects eg  caffeine 
the proposed warning addresses potential health risks allegedly associated with ephedrine containing dietary supplements 
it is similar  but not identical  to mandatory warnings that have been required by texas law since and california law since january  am and our other ephedrine containing supplements comply with these state law requirements 
however  some of our ephedrine containing products  like am  contain caffeine or other stimulants 
therefore  if the proposed rule is made final in its current form  it will prohibit the sale of some of our products in their present formulations 
on march   the fda published a proposed rule in the federal register which proposes comprehensive requirements for the manufacturing  packing and holding dietary supplements  also known as good manufacturing practices 
the fda is accepting public comments on the proposed gmps until june   final gmps will be promulgated after the fda has reviewed the public comments 
once final gmp regulations become effective  our manufacturer will be required to adhere to them 
the fda will most likely institute an effective date for the gmps which will allow our manufacturer a reasonable amount of time to conduct this review and  if necessary  revise its manufacturing operations to comply with the final gmp regulations 
product liability we  like other marketers of products that are intended to be ingested  face the inherent risk of exposure to product liability claims in the event that the use of our products results in injury 
we maintain limited product liability insurance coverage with limits of  per occurrence and  in the aggregate 
products containing ephedra  which represented approximately of our net revenue  are not covered by our product liability insurance 
we generally do not obtain contractual indemnification from our product manufacturers 
however  all of our product manufacturers carry product liability insurance  which covers our products 
a product liability claim could result in material losses 
legal proceedings we are currently involved in two products liability suits related to the ingestion of our ephedra based products 
answers to these petitions are due april and  as such  we have not had sufficient time to either investigate the facts of these cases or analyze appropriate defenses to the allegations 
we will deny any wrongdoing and intend to vigorously defend the claims 
the amounts of damages sought are unknown  but include compensatory and punitive damages 
liquidity and capital resources our primary source of liquidity has been cash provided by sales of our common stock  marketable securities and operating activities 
at december   we had working capital of  compared to  at december  we believe our cash and cash equivalents and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund our working capital needs over the next months 
during the year ended december   net cash provided by operating activities was  net cash provided by investing activities was  and net cash used in financing activities was  we had a net increase in cash during this period of  primarily as a result of operations 
our working capital needs over the next months consist primarily of marketing  distribution and administrative expenses 
in  we completed construction of a  square foot distribution and call center facility in oklahoma city 
this project was funded  in part  with bank loans of  for the land and building and  for the warehouse equipment 
both loans are with bank one oklahoma  na and accrue interest at an annual rate of 
under the prime rate 
the loans contain covenants restricting us from various activities without written consent of bank one  the most significant of which restrict us from transferring  selling or otherwise disposing of any assets  making any loans to any persons or entity in excess of  in the aggregate  engaging in any merger or acquisition in which we are not the surviving corporation  changing executive management personnel  and purchasing or acquiring any interest in any other entity 
the loans also contain financial covenants requiring us to maintain tangible net worth  consisting of total assets excluding intangible assets less total liabilities excluding subordinated debt  of at least debt coverage ratio  consisting of net income plus amortization  depreciation and interest expense  divided by current maturities of long term debt and capital leases plus interest expense  of at least  and debt to ebitda ratio  consisting of current and long term maturities of debt and capital leases  divided by net income plus amortization  depreciation  income tax and interest expense  of less than through december   less than for and less than thereafter 
at december   we were not in compliance with our debt coverage ratio or the debt to ebitda ratio 
per letter dated february   bank one oklahoma  na granted a waiver for the covenant violations for the period ended december  we have negotiated a new agreement with bank one  whereby the debt is secured by marketable securities 
as such  the debt will no longer be subject to financial covenants 
the following summarizes our contractual obligations at december  and the effect such obligations are expected to have on our liquidity and cash flow in future periods 
less than total year years years bank loans and notes 
    capital lease obligations 
   operating leases    total     see note to our financial statements 
at december   we had marketable debt and equity securities of  compared to  at december  all of our securities are unrestricted investments 
during the first quarter of  we agreed to loan john w 
hail  our chief executive officer and a major shareholder  up to  subsequently we also agreed to loan up to an additional  in  an additional  was approved 
on january  the outstanding balance on all the notes plus interest were combined into one note payable in monthly installments 
our board of directors unanimously approved the loans and extension 
these loans are collateralized by stock and property  and bear interest at per annum 
as of december   the balance due on these loans plus interest was  these loans will be paid in full in no new loans will be made to our officers or directors 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our balance sheet includes marketable securities  which we believe are a conservative blend of income and growth investments resulting in moderate market risk 
we invest in equity marketable securities to generate capital growth  and fixed income marketable securities to provide current income 
because of the nature of these investments  both current interest rates and equity market movements will affect total return and risk 
our fixed income investments of approximately  are subject to interest risk and market value risk 
we have approximately  of equity investments that are exposed to market risk 
interest rate risk 
we currently maintain an investment portfolio of high quality fixed income marketable securities 
all securities are available for sale and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value with fluctuations in fair value reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
we do not hedge our investment portfolio or our outstanding credit facility or other long term indebtedness 
fixed income investments with a maturity date of three months or less at the date of purchase are deemed to be cash equivalents 
any remaining fixed income securities are considered short term and mainly consist of investments in us treasury notes and bonds 
the following table lists our cash equivalents and our short term fixed income marketable securities at december  and december  december  december  average average interest fair interest rate fair rate cost value cost value cash equivalents 
    short term investments     average interest rate is calculated by taking the individual security interest rates multiplied by each investments weighted average share of the total fixed income marketable securities 
average interest rates for the year ended december  decreased 
from december  due to the redemption of  units of us government agency securities in the first quarter   units of us government agency securities in the third quarter and  units of us government agency securities in the fourth quarter these securities represented of our total fixed income marketable securities at december  fair value of the cash equivalents and fixed income marketable securities decreased  during the year ended december  to  from  at december  this decrease was primarily due to the reinvestment of approximately  of cash equivalents to equity securities  partially offset by an increase in short term investments of approximately  equity market risks 
we currently maintain an investment portfolio of equity securities 
all securities are available for sale and recorded in the balance sheet at fair value with fluctuations in fair value reported as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income in stockholders equity 
we do not engage in hedging our equity portfolio or otherwise purchase derivative securities 
because of the quality of our portfolio and liquid nature of our equity investments  we do not consider the market risk related to these investments to be material 
at december   our equity investments had a value of  compared to  at december   primarily due to the purchase of mutual fund equity investments in the second  third and fourth quarters of we attempt to manage our interest and market risk by evaluating and purchasing what we believe to be the best investment securities and rates of return available
