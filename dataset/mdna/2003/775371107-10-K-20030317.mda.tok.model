information regarding our industry segments and foreign operations can be found in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements and is incorporated herein by reference 
raw materials we use a variety of commodity chemicals as raw materials in our operations 
in most cases  these raw materials are purchased from multiple sources under long term supply contracts  created to provide access to key raw materials 
our monomers business purchases chemicals such as propylene  acetone  and various alcohols as raw materials for the manufacture of acrylic acid and its esters  as well as methyl methacrylate 
these monomeric products are sold to both external and internal businesses  such as coatings  adhesives and sealants and plastics additives 
competition and seasonality we experience vigorous competition in each of our segments 
our competitors include many large  multinational chemical firms based in europe  asia and the united states 
in some cases  we compete against firms that produce commodity chemicals  purchased by us as raw materials to make our products 
however  we do not believe this places us at any significant competitive disadvantage 
our products compete with similar products offered by other manufacturers on the basis of product quality and specifications  customer service and price 
most of our products are specialty chemicals which are sold to customers who demand a high level of customer service and technical expertise from us and our sales force 
our salt segment is most affected by weather related sales of highway ice control salt in the eastern united states and eastern canada 
to a much lesser extent  sales in the coatings segment destined for the architectural paint market are affected by weather in various regions 
environmental a discussion of environmental related factors can be found in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and is incorporated herein by reference to note contingent liabilities  guarantees and commitments in the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
research and development our principal research and development laboratories are located in spring house  pennsylvania 
a complete list of our technical and research centers throughout the world can be found in the table below 
we are committed to ongoing investment in research and development as a way to differentiate our existing products  while bringing new technologies and innovative  high value products to market 
we believe that our many intellectual properties are of substantial value in the manufacturing  marketing and application of our various products 
though we are not dependent  to a material extent  upon any one trademark  patent or license  certain of our businesses may be so dependent 
we spent million  million and million in  and  respectively  for research and development 
approximately of our spending is targeted to our three major growth businesses coatings  electronic materials  and adhesives and sealants

all other plants recorded favorable operating efficiencies and cost controls  especially considering the decline in demand due to slower global economies 
safety was a key focus  as well  and significant improvement was made throughout the year 
the overall corporate safety record improved from a rate of injuries for every  hours worked in  to injuries on a comparable basis in ninety one sites operated injury free throughout the year 
as part of our repositioning efforts  we closed manufacturing facilities in tustin and orange  california  moss point  mississippi and paterson  new jersey 
throughout  we announced plans to make further reductions in manufacturing capacity in several businesses  including two plants in europe 
continual improvements in design  operation  and process control have significantly improved the efficiency of our remaining manufacturing capacity 
we believe that we have the ability to generate significant additional production capacity using our existing manufacturing operations

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following commentary should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements for the years ended december   and significant items affecting the results of operations impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with this statement  we ceased amortization of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives 
as a result of our impairment testing in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 a non cash charge of million million after tax  was reflected in the results as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
the impairment charges impacted the majority of our reportable segments as follows coatings million  electronic materials million  performance chemicals million and salt million 
the impairment charges were primarily the result of the economic downturn over the past two years affecting growth assumptions in certain key markets 
in addition  customer consolidation in some areas has led to downward pressure on pricing and volume 
sale of the agricultural chemicals business in june  we completed the sale of our agricultural chemicals business ag to dow agrosciences llc das  a wholly owned subsidiary of the dow chemical company  for approximately billion

table of contents critical accounting estimates management s discussion and analysis is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments in the application of accounting policies that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
actual results may differ from these estimates if different assumptions are made or different conditions exist 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our accounting policies and disclosure practices 
in management s opinion  the critical accounting estimates  as defined below  are more complex in nature and require a higher degree of judgment than the remainder of our accounting policies in note organization and summary of significant accounting policies of the accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 
litigation and environmental reserves we are involved in litigation in the ordinary course of business including personal injury  property damage and environmental litigation 
additionally  we are involved in environmental remediation and spend significant amounts for both company owned and third party locations 
we are required to assess these matters to determine if a liability exists 
if we believe that a liability is probable and if the loss can be reasonably estimated  we will record a liability 
these estimates involve judgments we make after considering a broad range of information  including the claims  demands  settlement offers received from a governmental authority or private party  estimates performed by independent third parties  identification of other responsible parties and an assessment of their ability to contribute and our prior experience 
if we believe that no best estimate exists  we accrue the minimum in a range of possible losses as we are required to do under gaap 
we review these judgments on a quarterly basis and revise our accruals and disclosures as new facts become available 
the accruals we record are estimates and may differ materially from the ultimate outcome if our judgment and estimates turn out to be inaccurate 
income taxes the objectives of accounting for income taxes are essentially to recognize the amount of taxes payable or refundable for the current year and deferred tax liabilities and assets for the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in an entity s financial statements or tax returns 
all foreign earnings are expected to be remitted to the united states and since  upon remittance  such earnings are taxable  we provide federal income taxes on income from our foreign subsidiaries 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in our financial statements or tax returns 
if the outcome of these future tax consequences differs from our estimates the outcome could materially impact our financial position or our results of operations 
in addition  we operate within multiple taxing jurisdictions and are subject to audit in these jurisdictions 
we record accruals for the estimated outcomes of these audits and the accruals may change in the future due to the outcome of these audits 
restructuring from time to time  we record charges relating to efforts to strategically reposition our manufacturing footprint and support services 
these accruals include estimates for termination costs for employees affected by plant closings and other reduction in force efforts 
these accruals are based on various factors including length of service  contract provisions and salary levels 
at the time an accrual is established  we calculate our best estimate based upon detailed analysis 
although significant changes are not anticipated  actual costs may differ from these estimates 
long lived assets our long lived assets include land  buildings  equipment  long term investments  goodwill  indefinite lived intangible assets and other intangible assets 
long lived assets  other than investments  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets  are depreciated over their estimated useful lives  and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  whenever changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable 
such circumstances would include items  such as  a significant decrease in the market price of a long lived asset  a significant adverse change in the manner the asset is being used or in its physical condition or a history of operating or cash flow losses associated with the use of the asset 
when such events or changes occur  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use and  if applicable  the eventual disposition of the assets 
the key variables that we must estimate include assumptions regarding future sales volume  prices and other economic factors 
significant management judgment is involved in estimating these variables  and they include inherent uncertainties since they are frequently forecasting future events 
the assumptions used are consistent with our internal planning  however  different assumptions would result in different estimates 
therefore  we periodically evaluate and update the estimates based on the conditions that influence these variables 
if such assets are considered impaired  they are written down to fair value as appropriate 

table of contents goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are reviewed annually or sooner if changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable under the provisions of sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
fair values are estimated based upon forecasted cash flows discounted to present value 
if actual cash flows or discount rate estimates change  we may have to record additional impairment charges not previously recognized 
the fair values of our long term investments are dependant on the performance of the entities in which we invest  as well as volatility inherent in their external markets 
in assessing potential impairment for these investments  we will consider these factors as well as the forecasted financial performance of its investment entities 
if these forecasts are not met  we may have to record additional impairment charges 
pension and other employee benefits certain assumptions are used to measure plan obligations and related assets of company sponsored defined benefit pension plans  post retirement benefits  post employment benefits eg medical  disability and other employee liabilities 
plan obligations and annual expense calculations are based on a number of key assumptions 
these assumptions include the weighted average discount rate at which obligations can be effectively settled  the anticipated rate of future increases in compensation levels  the expected long term rate of return on assets and increases or trends in health care costs 
we typically use actuaries to assist us in preparing these calculations and determining these assumptions 
these assumptions involve inherent uncertainties  which may not be controllable by management  and as a result  adjustments to expense may be required in future periods 
for further information concerning our pension plans and other employee benefits  refer to note pension plans and note employee benefits in our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements 

table of contents business segments at december  based on realignment of internal management accountability  we changed our reportable business segments in accordance with sfas no

consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net sales and operating margins in  our consolidated net sales were  million  an increase of or million  from net sales of  million 
favorable volume  improved product mix and the favorable impact of foreign currencies increased sales by in total  or million 
volume and product mix contributed million and the favorable impact of foreign currencies contributed million to the increase 
these increases were offset by or million  primarily from lower selling prices and the impact of exited businesses  net of acquisitions 
the growth from reflects strong sales in our coatings segment  particularly for products in the home improvement and automotive markets 
sales in our electronic materials segment also increased as the market for these products began to recover and demand for advanced technology product lines increased 
these increases were partially offset by lower sales in the adhesives and sealants segment  due to the lack of sales in the current year from the divested liquid polysulfide business  which was exited at the end of our operating gross profit for was  million  an increase of from  million in our gross profit margin increased to from in primarily due to favorable volumes  product mix and raw material costs in  offset by lower selling prices and the impact of exited businesses  net of acquisitions 
in  we recognized approximately million of additional costs for demolition  dismantlement and employee relocation over levels associated with the implementation of our repositioning efforts 
however  insurance settlements of million recognized in more than offset the impact of these increased costs 
in  we anticipate raw material and natural gas prices to significantly exceed levels  however  it is difficult to predict the extent and duration of the higher prices 
to support our operations  we purchase approximately billion pounds of petrochemical based raw materials globally  the single largest of these raw materials is propylene at approximately billion pounds annually 
we have hedges in place for about half of our annual natural gas purchases of approximately million mmbtu s 
although we are making efforts to mitigate the impact of escalating raw material and energy costs  we anticipate the gap between raw material and selling prices to increase at least in the short term  negatively impacting gross margin in additionally  we anticipate higher 
table of contents expenses for employee related benefits in see selling  administrative and research below for additional discussion of these increases 
selling  administrative and research sar expenses in  sar expenses increased  or million  to  million from  million in primarily due to higher levels of research and development spending 
consistent with our commitment to continue investing in research and development as a way of differentiating our existing products  while bringing new highly valued products to market  spending increased from the remaining increase is due to higher selling and administrative expense from increased health care costs and normal wage increases 
our sar expenses were of net sales for compared to in we anticipate higher employee related costs in as a result of normal salary increases  the increasing trend of health care costs  an increase of approximately million in pension costs due to a combination of the decline in the market value of pension plan assets and changes in certain pension plan assumptions  particularly the discount rate  and the impact of a change in accounting for stock options 
beginning in  we will expense stock options 
further  we will increase our use of restricted stock which  along with stock options  will increase stock based compensation expense in by 

per share  after tax 
interest expense interest expense for was million  a decline from million in  primarily due to lower effective interest rates on lower average debt levels 
amortization of goodwill and other intangibles amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets for was million  a decrease from million in the decrease is a direct result of the company s adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on january   which ceased the amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles 
excluding amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles in accordance with sfas no 
 amortization expense would have been million in on a pro forma basis 
the decrease from  on a pro forma basis  is primarily attributable to the impact of intangible asset impairments 
share of affiliate net earnings in  we recorded affiliate net earnings of million  a increase from earnings of million in provision for restructuring and asset impairments in  we recognized million for restructuring and asset impairments 
this charge is comprised of million for the impairment of certain long lived assets and costs associated with workforce reductions initiated in offsetting this charge was million of income resulting from pension settlement gains associated with individuals terminated from our pension plans and changes to estimates  both of which were in connection with our repositioning 
of the total charges  million was non cash in nature and comprised of asset impairments recorded to reduce the carrying value of certain identified assets to their fair values  which were calculated using cash flow analyses 
the assumptions used in the calculations were consistent with our internal planning process 
the largest  single asset write down was million  recorded to write down certain long lived intangible and fixed assets of the printed wiring board business in the electronic materials segment in accordance with sfas no 
accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the remaining million of non cash charges  recorded during  related largely to the closure of two european plants and other building and equipment impairments 
in a continued effort to streamline operational efficiencies  approximately million of expense was recognized for costs associated with a general reduction in force of over positions throughout various functions of our organization 
in most cases  separated employees were offered early termination benefits 
the charge is based on actual amounts paid to employees as well as amounts expected to be paid upon termination 
the anticipated annual costs savings from these efforts is approximately million  primarily in compensation expense 
in  we recognized a million restructuring and asset impairment charge that enabled several of our businesses to respond to structural changes in the global marketplace 
the largest component related to the partial closure of certain manufacturing and research facilities across all business groups and included exit costs related to the liquid polysulfide business in adhesives and sealants and part of the dyes business in performance chemicals 
approximately of the assets impaired were in the north american region 
the charge included severance benefits for employees affected by plant closings  capacity reductions and various 
table of contents personnel in corporate  administrative and shared service functions 
approximately  positions were expected to be affected by the restructuring efforts 
offsetting the charge of million recorded in june  was a pre tax gain of million from the recognition of settlement gains recorded for employees terminated from our pension plans in connection with restructuring activities and changes in estimates to restructuring liabilities established for the initiatives 
therefore  in total  we incurred charges of million for our repositioning 
it is our policy to recognize settlement gains at the time an employee s pension liability is settled 
we may continue to undertake productivity initiatives  including organizational restructuring  plant closures and manufacturing footprint redesign to improve performance and generate cost savings 
future initiatives could result in restructuring and asset impairment charges 
other income  net in  net other income declined to million from million in largely due to income items such as currency gains and the gain on sale of a divested business recorded in that did not repeat during effective tax rate the effective tax rate for earnings from continuing operations of million for the year ended december  was 
the loss in from continuing operations reflected a effective tax rate 
the rate was affected by two items non deductible restructuring expense  and non deductible amortization expense 
the effective tax rate on continuing operations in was 
net earnings loss in  we reported a net loss of million compared to earnings of million 
this equates to a loss per diluted share of in compared to earnings per share of 
the net loss in was primarily a result of adopting sfas no 
 which resulted in a million charge for impairment losses 
this charge was reflected as a cumulative effect of accounting change 
in addition  we recognized million after tax in provisions for restructuring and asset impairments  which also contributed to this net loss 
improved gross profit and lower interest and amortization expense favorably impacted the earnings 
net earnings of million in largely resulted from the million gain on sale of ag 
net earnings were negatively impacted by million  after tax  by the provision for restructuring and asset impairments relating to the repositioning initiatives 
results of operations for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  by business segment pro forma results for presented below exclude amortization of goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets 
coatings in  net sales from our coatings segment were  million  an increase of from net sales of  million in earnings from continuing operations were million for  as compared to million in on a pro forma basis 
asset impairment and restructuring charges of million after tax  recognized in connection with the repositioning efforts  drove the change from additionally  in our coatings segment realized benefits primarily from favorable volume and product mix  in addition to cost savings achieved from cost reduction efforts 
more specifically  consumer markets in architectural and functional coatings continued to drive earnings with increased demand in the consumer paint and paper markets 
new products for the semi gloss paint market in the us and europe  a formaldehyde free insulation binder and opaque polymers also provided favorable results 
automotive coatings experienced an increase in net sales due to an increase in north american automotive production and the continued demand for plastic parts used in automobiles 
the acquisition of ferro corporation s european powder coatings business favorably impacted the net sales of powder coatings by million in the fourth quarter of  although us markets remained weak 
adhesives and sealants in  net sales from adhesives and sealants were million  a decline of from net sales of million in the decline in sales was primarily due to the impact of exiting the liquid polysulfide business at the end of on a comparable basis  net sales increased from due to increased demand for flexible packaging  more environmentally friendly adhesives and the positive impact of new products launched in 
table of contents this segment reported a loss from continuing operations of million in  compared to a loss of million from the prior year on a pro forma basis primarily due to restructuring and asset impairment charges recognized in connection with our repositioning efforts 
the increase from is offset by the impact of the exited liquid polysulfide business and additional research and engineering costs associated with the redesign of our manufacturing and laboratory footprint 
electronic materials in  net sales from electronic materials were million  an increase of from prior year net sales of million 
the increase can be primarily attributed to greater demand for advanced technology products 
in  electronic materials reported no earnings as compared to million in on a pro forma basis 
in addition to the benefits realized from increased demand for higher value product lines through sales and gross profit this segment demonstrated cost savings reductions primarily in selling and administrative costs during these gains were offset in full by the million  after tax impairment charge recognized in for some of the intangible and fixed assets in the printed wiring board business 
performance chemicals in  net sales from performance chemicals were  million  an increase of from prior year net sales of  million 
plastics additives contributed approximately million from increased volume  product mix and currency gains 
these gains were partially offset by lower sales of million from inorganic and specialty solutions due mostly to the impact of exited businesses 
increased volume and favorable product mix were offset by decreased selling prices in consumer and industrial specialties 
net sales from ion exchange resins remained flat over earnings from continuing operations were million for the current year compared to million in the prior year on a pro forma basis 
the year over year change was driven by restructuring and asset impairment charges recognized in in connection with our repositioning efforts 
the earnings increase was driven primarily by plastics additives and inorganic and specialty solutions 
salt in  net sales from salt were million  a decline of from prior year net sales of million 
the effect of the milder winter weather on the ice control market was the primary cause for the decline 
earnings from continuing operations were million for compared to million from the prior year on a pro forma basis due to charges incurred in connection with our repositioning efforts 
the year over year change was driven by restructuring and asset impairment charges recognized in in connection with our repositioning efforts 
monomers in  net sales from monomers were million  an increase of from prior year net sales of million 
the increase was generated primarily by increased volume from internal customers  mostly in the coatings segment 
earnings from continuing operations were million for the current year compared to million in the prior year on a pro forma basis 
the difference was primarily driven by volume increases  moderate energy costs  lower logistics costs and on going cost reduction initiatives  which were partially offset by costs related to production outages experienced during the second half of at our deer park  texas plant 
corporate corporate reported a loss from continuing operations in of million  compared to a loss of million as reported and a loss of million on a pro forma basis in the decrease is primarily attributed to charges incurred in in connection with our repositioning efforts 
in addition  the decrease is due to a reduction of million after tax in interest expense and million after tax of favorable insurance settlements  compared to net insurance expense of million in the prior year 
this decrease was partially tempered by a reduction in pension credits of approximately million after tax compared to  due to transition assets which were fully amortized as of december  and diminished economic returns from pension assets 
consolidated results of operations for the year ended december   as compared to the year ended december  net sales and operating margins consolidated net sales in were  million  below net sales of  million 
the decrease from was driven by persistently weak global demand across all businesses and the impact of exited businesses 

table of contents compared to  net sales for electronic materials declined  which had been buffeted by a precipitous industry wide decline since april coatings net sales declined from the prior year on lower volumes and performance chemicals fell due to persistent sluggishness in the paper and industrial markets served by the businesses in this group 
salt sales  on a same business basis  remained flat as both periods benefited from strong demand for highway ice control products in the winter season 
in the fourth quarter of  we sold our european salt business 
the company s operating gross profit for was  million  a decline from  million in our gross profit margin was  down from in primarily due to lower manufacturing efficiency driven by reduced demand 
we responded by maintaining price increases and improving internal efficiencies 
selling  administrative and research sar expenses sar expenses were  million for  a decrease from  million in  reflecting savings from our repositioning efforts as well as a decrease in employee related expenses 
these cost reductions were offset by increased research and development costs reflecting our continued focus on developing cutting edge technologies and enterprise resource planning erp expenditures

since the second quarter of  when we increased our ownership from to  rodel s results of operations have been fully consolidated 
provision for restructuring and asset impairments provision for restructuring of million pre tax or million after tax was comprised primarily of asset impairment and restructuring charges relating to our repositioning initiatives that commenced in june we recognized a million restructuring and asset impairment charge in the second quarter of  which enabled several of our businesses to respond to structural changes in the global marketplace

on a pro forma basis  corporate losses decreased to million compared to million in liquidity  capital resources and other financial data during the year ended december   cash increased by million primarily from continuing operating activities  which generated million in as compared to million in  a net increase of million 
the increase derived primarily from higher sales  reduced cash outflows for working capital  prior year income tax refunds  and insurance settlements 
these favorable cash inflows were offset partially by cash used to cover retiree health care costs  previously funded by transfers from the us pension plan 
cash used by investing activities was million in additions to land  buildings and equipment accounted for million of the cash outflow 
the remaining cash was used for acquisitions and income tax payments on the gain from the sale of ag

net cash used in financing activities was million in as compared to  million in during  million of long term debt was repurchased and million was paid out in dividends 
we also issued billion yen denominated approximately million  year coupon notes via a private placement in the net repayments of million of short term borrowings and million of long term debt were the primary uses of cash in we consider the reduction of debt to be one of our important strategic objectives 
we evaluate operating performance based upon several factors including the ability to generate free cash flow 
our definition of free cash flow is cash provided by operating activities less capital asset spending and dividends 
free cash flow is not a measurement recognized in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap and should not be viewed as an alternative to gaap measures of performance 
furthermore  this measure may not be consistent with similar measures presented by other companies 
free cash flows for the years ended december   and were as follows in millions cash provided by operating activities less additions to land  building and equipment less dividends free cash flow 
table of contents we focus on increasing free cash flow to achieve our financial objectives and to provide consistent shareholder return within dividend growth 
in and  we utilized free cash flow primarily to reduce debt levels and secondarily make strategic acquisitions 
in  we anticipate utilizing free cash flow to further reduce our debt levels and continue to pay out dividends 
total borrowings were  million and  million at december  and  respectively 
in total  principal amounts of our long term debt increased to  at december  from  at december  in general  this increase is attributable to changes in currency from our euro and yen denominated debt 
debt repayments were essentially offset by the issuance of debt in for further information concerning our borrowings  refer to note short term obligations and note long term debt in our accompanying notes to consolidated financial statements

environmental there is a risk of environmental impact in chemical manufacturing operations 
our environmental policies and practices are designed to ensure compliance with existing laws and regulations and to minimize the possibility of significant environmental impact 
the laws and regulations under which we operate require significant expenditures for capital improvements  the operation of environmental protection equipment and remediation 
future developments and even more stringent environmental regulations may require us to make additional unforeseen environmental expenditures 
our major competitors are confronted by substantially similar environmental risks and regulations 
we are a party in various government enforcement and private actions associated with former waste disposal sites  many of which are on the us environmental protection agency s epa national priority list  and we have been named a potentially responsible party prp at approximately inactive waste sites where remediation costs have been or may be incurred under the federal comprehensive environmental response  compensation and liability act and similar state statutes 
in some of these cases we may also be held responsible for alleged property damage 
we have provided for future costs at certain of these sites 
we are also involved in corrective actions at some of our manufacturing facilities 
we consider a broad range of information when we determine the amount necessary for remediation accruals  including available facts about the waste site  existing and proposed remediation technology and the range of costs of applying those technologies  prior experience  government proposals for this or similar sites  the liability of other parties  the ability of other prps to pay costs apportioned to them and current laws and regulations 
we assess the accruals quarterly and update as additional technical and legal information becomes available 
however  at certain sites  we are unable  due to a variety of factors  to assess and quantify the ultimate extent of our responsibility for study and remediation costs 
among the sites for which we have accrued liabilities are both non company owned superfund sites and company facilities 
our significant sites are described in more detail below 
whitmoyer site the whitmoyer site  located in jackson township  lebanon county  pennsylvania  was the location of a veterinary pharmaceutical manufacturing facility 
when rohm and haas acquired the site in  it discovered arsenic contamination and we voluntarily undertook extensive remedial measures with the guidance of the pennsylvania department of health 
in  we sold the site to beecham  inc  which in turn sold the site to stafford laboratories in glaxosmithkline is the successor entity to beecham  inc  and the only other solvent known prp for this site 
remediation on the site has been completed except for ongoing groundwater remediation 
in january  the company settled litigation with glaxosmithkline out of court and based on this settlement adjusted the accrual as of december  to reflect the agreed upon allocation of the remediation costs 
woodlands sites the woodlands sites include two separate locations in the new jersey pinelands near chatsworth  new jersey 
the other known prps share remedial costs with rohm and haas 
these prps are performing a groundwater treatment program at these sites that is expected to be completed in to years 
once the groundwater treatment program is completed  the prps are required to monitor a downgradient groundwater plume 
kramer landfill during the s  our manufacturing waste and that of numerous other known prps was disposed of at the kramer landfill located in mantua township  new jersey 
rohm and haas and other prps entered into a consent decree with the new jersey department of environmental protection and the epa in march all remedial tasks have been completed except for groundwater remediation 
the prps are currently operating the groundwater treatment facility at the site 
the groundwater treatment program is expected to continue for an indeterminate time 
wood ridge site in wood ridge  new jersey  morton and velsicol chemical corporation velsicol have been held jointly and severally liable for the cost of remediation of environmental problems associated with a mercury processing plant site subsequently acquired by morton 
as of the date we acquired morton  morton disclosed and accrued for certain ongoing studies related to the site 

table of contents additional data gathering has delayed completion of these studies until or later 
in our allocation of the purchase price of morton  we accrued for additional study costs as of december  and additional remediation costs in the first half of based on the ongoing studies 
our exposure at the site will depend on the results of attempts to obtain contributions from others believed to share responsibility 
a cost recovery action against certain parties is pending in federal court 
this action has been stayed pending future regulatory developments and the appeal of a summary judgment ruling in favor of one of the defendants 
settlements have been reached with some defendants for de minimis claims associated with the site 
our exposure will also depend upon the continued ability of velsicol to contribute to remediation costs 
in  velsicol stopped paying its share of expenses 
velsicol s indemnitor  fruit of the loom  inc  has been reorganized under chapter bankruptcy and was discharged of its responsibility for this site after a payment to us of approximately million 
in  the bankruptcy court approved a government settlement entered into with velsicol  fruit of the loom  and other parties  which created a fund to be used to respond to the velsicol liabilities at several sites  including wood ridge 
morton has contractual rights against velsicol for payment of a share of remedial costs 
these rights are not affected by the government settlement 
we also agreed to fund up to  for the epa to develop a workplan for a separate study of contamination in berry s creek  which runs near the site  and of the surrounding wetlands 
in october  the epa requested information relating to sources of contamination in berry s creek  we understand this request was sent to over ninety potentially responsible parties 
the estimated costs of any resulting remediation of berry s creek were not considered in the allocation of the morton purchase price 
there is much uncertainty as to what will be required to address berry s creek  but cleanup costs could be very high and our share of these costs could be material to the results of our operations  cash flows and consolidated financial position 
moss point during  the epa notified morton of possible irregularities in water discharge monitoring reports filed by its moss point  mississippi plant in early morton investigated and identified other environmental issues at the plant 
although at the date of acquisition morton had accrued for some remediation and legal costs  we revised these accruals as part of the allocation of the purchase price of morton based on our discussions with the authorities and on the information available as of june  in  we reached agreement with the epa  the department of justice and the state of mississippi  resolving these historical environmental issues 
the agreement received court approval in early the final settlement included payment of million in civil penalties  which were paid in the first quarter of  million in criminal penalties  which were paid in the fourth quarter of  and million in various supplemental environmental projects 
the accruals established for this matter were sufficient to cover these and other related costs of the settlement 
in december  we closed the chemicals portion of the moss point facility 
although we have not yet been served  in december a complaint was filed in mississippi on behalf of over plaintiffs against morton international  rohm and haas  joseph magazzu and the mississippi department of environmental quality alleging personal injury and property damage caused by environmental contamination 
at this time  we see no basis for these claims and we will defend this case vigorously 
houston plant our houston plant is an approximately acre facility located in deer park  texas 
the texas commission on environmental quality tceq issued a resource conservation and recovery act rcra part b permit and a compliance plan calling for a rcra facility investigation for certain solid waste management units swmu s and remediation of other units 
pursuant to the compliance plan and subsequent investigations  the facility continues to operate groundwater recovery systems at two units  has investigated and continues to monitor one unit  will prepare a corrective measures study for another unit  and has submitted the affected property assessment report apar concluding that no further action is required for four units 
final approval of the apar is pending tceq s review 
paterson site we closed the former morton plant at paterson  new jersey in december  and are currently undertaking remediation of the site under new jersey s industrial site recovery act 
investigation of contamination of shallow soils and groundwater is nearly complete  with further investigation of deeper groundwater ongoing 
remediation systems for product and shallow groundwater recovery are in place and awaiting authorization from new jersey authorities to operate  and soil remediation measures are undergoing evaluation 
an accrual was recorded for known remediation activities in september  and revised in september  to address information obtained during the ongoing site investigation 

table of contents other environmental matters the amount charged to earnings pre tax for environmental remediation was million  million and immaterial for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the reserves for remediation were million and million at december  and  respectively  and are recorded as liabilities current and long term in the consolidated balance sheets 
these reserves include amounts resulting from the allocation of the purchase price of morton 
we are pursuing lawsuits over insurance coverage for certain environmental liabilities 
it is our practice to reflect environmental insurance recoveries in results of operations for the quarter in which the litigation is resolved through settlement or other appropriate legal processes 
resolutions typically resolve coverage for both past and future environmental spending 
we settled with several of our insurance carriers and recorded income pre tax of approximately million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in addition to accrued environmental liabilities  we have reasonably possible loss contingencies related to environmental matters of approximately million and million at december  and december   respectively 
we have reserved for the costs we believe are probable and estimable and other costs which have not met the definition of probable have been included in our disclosure of reasonably possible loss contingencies 
further  we have identified other sites  including our larger manufacturing facilities  where additional future environmental remediation may be required  but these loss contingencies cannot reasonably be estimated at this time 
these matters involve significant unresolved issues  including the number of parties found liable at each site and their ability to pay  the outcome of negotiations with regulatory authorities  the alternative methods of remediation and the range of costs associated with those alternatives 
we believe that these matters  when ultimately resolved  which may be over an extended period of time  will not have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or consolidated cash flows  but could have a material adverse effect on consolidated results of operations or cash flows in any given period 
capital spending for new environmental protection equipment was million in versus million in and million in spending for and is expected to be million and million  respectively 
capital expenditures in this category include projects whose primary purposes are pollution control and safety  as well as environmental aspects of projects in other categories that are intended primarily to improve operations or increase plant efficiency 
we expect future capital spending for environmental protection equipment to be consistent with prior year spending patterns 
capital spending does not include the cost of environmental remediation of waste disposal sites 
cash expenditures for waste disposal site remediation were million in  million in and million in the expenditures for remediation are charged against accrued remediation reserves 
the cost of operating and maintaining environmental facilities was million  million and million in  and respectively  and was charged against current year earnings 
other litigation in february  we were served with european commission decisions requiring submission to investigations in france and the united kingdom  a search permit in japan from the japanese fair trade commission  an order for the production of records and information in canada and two grand jury records subpoenas in the united states all relating to a global antitrust investigation of the plastics additives industry 
we are cooperating fully with all governmental authorities 
there has been increased publicity about asbestos liabilities faced by manufacturing companies 
as a result of the bankruptcy of most major asbestos producers  plaintiffs attorneys are increasing their focus on peripheral defendants  including the company 
we believe that we have adequate reserves and insurance and do not believe we have a material asbestos exposure 
there are pending lawsuits filed against morton related to employee exposure to asbestos at a manufacturing facility in weeks island  louisiana with additional lawsuits expected 
we expect that most of these cases will be dismissed because they are barred under worker s compensation laws  however  cases involving asbestos caused malignancies may not be barred under louisiana law 
subsequent to the morton acquisition  we commissioned medical studies to estimate possible future claims and recorded accruals based on the results 
morton has also been sued in connection with the former friction division of the former thiokol corporation  which merged with morton in settlement amounts to date have been minimal and many cases have closed with no payment 
we estimate that all costs associated with future claims  including defense costs  will be well below our insurance limits 
in addition  like most manufacturing companies  we have been sued  generally as one of many defendants  by non employees who allege exposure to asbestos on company premises 
we do not believe that it is reasonably possible that a material loss will be incurred in excess of the amounts recorded for all pending cases 

table of contents we are also parties to litigation arising out of the ordinary conduct of our business 
recognizing the amounts reserved for such items and the uncertainty of the ultimate outcomes  it is our opinion that the resolution of all these pending lawsuits  investigations and claims will not have a material adverse effect  individually or in the aggregate  upon our results of operations  cash flows or our consolidated financial position 
indemnifications in connection with the divestiture of several of our operating businesses  we have agreed to retain  and or indemnify the purchaser against certain liabilities of the divested business  including liabilities relating to defective products sold by the business or environmental contamination arising or taxes accrued prior to the date of the sale 
our indemnification obligations with respect to these liabilities may be indefinite as to duration and may or may not be subject to a deductible  minimum claim amount or cap 
as such  it is not possible for us to predict the likelihood that a claim will be made or to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential loss or range of loss

ferro corporation s powder coatings business produces materials used mostly by manufacturers of metal products to finish materials like window frames and automotive wheels 
we have not yet finalized the purchase price allocation for this acquisition 
in september  we increased our ownership in rodel at an additional cost of million  retaining a ownership 
the additional cost was recorded as goodwill 
rodel is a leader in precision polishing technology serving the semiconductor  memory disk and glass polishing industries 
in december  we acquired the global plastics additives business of our joint venture partner  kureha chemical  for approximately million 
included in the acquisition are the commercial operations throughout the asia pacific region and other areas along with the manufacturing facilities and laboratories in singapore  as well as technical service laboratories in beijing 

table of contents additionally  we gained full control of manufacturing sites in singapore and grangemouth  scotland  which were sites previously part of the joint venture 
the acquisition effectively terminates the joint ventures we had with kureha chemical 
we have not yet finalized the purchase price allocation for this acquisition 
we completed the following significant acquisitions and divestitures in in  we increased our ownership in rodel from to at an additional cost of approximately million 
in the second quarter of we increased our ownership from to approximately at a cost of approximately million 
the financial statements reflect allocations of the purchase price amounts based on estimated fair values  and resulted in acquired goodwill of million  which  until the adoption of sfas no 
 was amortized on a straight line basis over years 
prior to march  the investment had been accounted for under the equity method with our share of earnings reported as equity in affiliates 
since the second quarter of  the results of rodel s operations were fully consolidated 
on june   we completed the sale of ag to das  a wholly owned subsidiary of the dow chemical company  for approximately billion  subject to a purchase price adjustment 
we recorded a gain on the sale in the amount of million pre tax million or per share  after tax in during  we reduced this gain by approximately million after tax due to additional working capital adjustments 
in february  all remaining working capital disputes with das were resolved through binding arbitration 
no additional adjustment to the gain on sale is expected 
under the terms of the agreement  the divestiture included fungicides  insecticides  herbicides  trademarks  and license to all agricultural uses of our biotechnology assets  as well as the agricultural business related manufacturing sites located in brazil  colombia  france and italy  our share of the nantong  china joint venture and our assets in muscatine  iowa 
we recorded the sale of ag as discontinued operations in accordance with apb opinion no 
reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions 
the operating results of ag have been reported separately as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of operations for each year presented 
net sales and income from discontinued operations are as follows in millions net sales operating income income tax expense income from discontinued operations change in functional currencies on december   we substantially completed the legal restructuring and business integration of our foreign operations  primarily in europe  following the morton and learonal acquisitions in based on these significant operational changes  on january  we determined that the functional currency of a majority of our foreign entities was their respective local currency 
this change resulted in a one time write down of fixed assets and inventories of approximately million in the first quarter of with a corresponding charge to other comprehensive income loss  included in currency translation adjustment

as of december   the majority of our european  electronic materials and plastics additives businesses were operational on the new erp platform 
we intend to convert the majority of both the north american region  including the corporate office and the spring house research facility  and the asia pacific region to the new erp platform in new accounting pronouncements goodwill and other intangible assets effective january   we adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
in accordance with this statement  as of january   we ceased amortization of goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives  and reclassified certain intangible assets to goodwill 
under sfas no 
 goodwill and certain indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but instead are reviewed for impairment at least annually and are written down only in periods in which it is determined that the fair value is less than the book value 
as a result of our impairment testing in connection with the adoption of this standard  a non cash charge of million million after tax  was reflected in the results of operations 
in addition  the annual impairment review required under sfas no 
was completed with no additional impairments identified 
the charge from adoption was reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the consolidated statement of operations 
of the total impairment  million pertained to goodwill and million million after tax related to indefinite lived intangible assets within the salt segment 
the after tax charge is as follows coatings million  electronic materials million  performance chemicals million  and salt million 
the impairment charges are primarily the result of the economic downturn over the past two years affecting growth assumptions in certain key markets 
in addition  customer consolidation in some areas has led to downward pressure on pricing and volume 
sfas no 
requires the transitional impairment review for goodwill  as well as an annual impairment review  be performed on a reporting unit basis 
when evaluating goodwill for impairment  sfas no 
requires us to first compare a reporting unit s book value of net assets  including goodwill  to its fair value 
fair value was estimated based upon discounted cash flow analyses 
to the extent that the book value exceeded fair value  we were required to perform a second step to measure the amount of the impairment loss 
in the second step  we determined implied goodwill by determining the fair value for the assets and liabilities of our reporting units 
to the extent that a reporting unit s book value of goodwill exceeded its implied fair value  impairment existed and was recognized 
long lived assets  other than investments  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are depreciated over their useful lives and are reviewed for impairment in accordance with sfas no 
we evaluated our finite lived intangible assets and determined there to be no change in circumstances that would indicate that the carrying value of any given asset may not be recoverable 
asset retirement obligations in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement requires the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets to be recognized when a legal obligation to incur such costs arises as a result of the acquisition  construction  development and or the normal operation of a long lived asset 
this statement also requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred  if 
table of contents a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made 
these asset retirement costs are included as part of the carrying asset and subsequently allocated to expense over the asset s useful life similar to depreciation 
sfas no 
is effective for fiscal years beginning after december  we adopted this statement effective january  and will recognize expense for asset retirement obligation liabilities for assets already in place as of january  based on our evaluation to date  the adoption of sfas no 
is expected to result in a charge of approximately 
to 
per share  after tax that will be reported as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the first quarter of impairment or disposal of long lived assets on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement provided guidance for the recognition of impairment losses on long lived assets to be held and used or to be disposed of and also broadened the definition of what constitutes a discontinued operation and how the results of a discontinued operation are to be measured and presented

sfas no 
is effective for years beginning after may  we will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
during the first quarter of year for the year ended december   we recorded extraordinary losses on early extinguishment of debt of million after tax 
these losses will be reclassified to continuing operations in after adopting sfas no 
 to maintain comparability for the reported periods 
costs associated with exit or disposal activities in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement addresses the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for pursuant to the guidance in emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the statement requires recording costs associated with exit or disposal activities at their fair values when a liability has been incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for disposal activities initiated after december  the new guidance will impact the timing of recognition and the initial measurement of the amount of liabilities that we recognize in connection with exit or disposal activities initiated after the effective date 
we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial statements 
guarantor s accounting in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin requires that the guarantor recognize  at the inception of certain guarantees  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing such guarantee 
fin also requires additional disclosure requirements about the guarantor s obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   and the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statement periods ending after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on our financial statements 
stock based compensation in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to fair value based method of accounting for stock based compensation 
the statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements of the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the methods used on reported results 
while sfas no 
does not amend sfas no 
to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are applicable to all companies with employee stock based compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the interim disclosure provisions are effective for interim periods beginning after december  we adopted the annual disclosure provisions as of december  and the interim 
table of contents disclosure provisions will be adopted during the first quarter of effective january   we prospectively adopted the fair value method of recording stock based compensation as defined in sfas no 
for stock options awarded to employees after the date of adoption 
we expect the impact of adoption to increase stock based compensation expense in by approximately 
per share  after tax 
under the prospective method  the initial year impact is roughly one third based on our vesting policy of the estimated fair value of the grants

management is currently assessing the impact of the new standard on our financial statements 
cautionary statements any statements we make in our filings with the securities and exchange commission or other communications including press releases and analyst meetings and calls that are not statements of historical fact are forward looking statements 
these statements include  without limitation  those relating to anticipated product plans  litigation and environmental matters  currency effects  profitability  and other commitments or goals 
forward looking statements are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results to differ materially from the statements made 
these risks and uncertainties include  but are not limited to  the following currencies and economic conditions approximately of our revenues are derived from outside the united states  a significant portion of which are denominated in foreign currencies 
also  significant production facilities are located outside of the united states 
our financial results therefore can be affected by changes in foreign currency rates 
we use certain financial instruments to mitigate these effects  but we do not hedge our foreign currency exposure in a manner that would entirely eliminate the effects of changes in foreign exchange rates on our earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
accordingly  reported revenue  net income  cash flows and fair values have been and in the future may be affected by changes in foreign exchange rates 
in addition  because of the extensive nature of our foreign business activities  financial results could be adversely affected by changes in worldwide economic conditions  changes in trade policies or tariffs  changes in interest rates  and political unrest 
competition and demand our products are sold in a competitive  global economy 
competitors include many large multinational chemical firms based in europe  asia and the united states 
new competitive products or pricing policies of our competitors can materially affect demand for and pricing of our products 
in addition  financial results are subject to fluctuations in demand  the seasonal activity of certain of our businesses and weather conditions  particularly for the salt segment 
we also manufacture and sell our products to customers in industries and countries that are experiencing periods of rapid change  most notably countries in eastern europe  latin america and the asia pacific region 
these factors can affect demand for our products and therefore may have a significant impact on financial results 
supply and capacity from time to time  certain raw materials we require become limited 
it is likely this will occur again in the future 
should such limitations arise  disruptions of our supply chain may lead to higher prices and or shortages 
also  we are subject to increases in raw material prices and  from time to time  experience significant capacity limitations in our manufacturing operations 
these limitations  disruptions in supply  price increases and capacity constraints could adversely affect financial results 
technology we have invested significant resources in intellectual properties such as patents  trademarks  copyrights and trade secrets 
since we depend on these intellectual resources for our financial stability and future growth  we rely on the protection that these intellectual property rights provide 
the development and successful 
table of contents implementation of new  competing technologies in the market place could significantly impact future financial results 
joint ventures  acquisitions and alliances we have entered  and in the future may enter  into arrangements with other companies to expand product offerings and to enhance our own capabilities 
we may continue to make strategic acquisitions and divestitures 
the success of acquisitions of new technologies  companies and products  or arrangements with third parties  is not predictable and there can be no assurance that we will be successful in realizing our objectives  or that realization may not take longer than anticipated  or that there will not be unintended adverse consequences from these actions 
environmental litigation risks and uncertainties related to environmental matters are discussed previously in this section under the caption environmental 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices since we denominate our business transactions in a variety of foreign currencies  finance our operations through long and short term borrowings  and purchase raw materials at market prices 
as a result  future earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities are subject to uncertainty 
our operating and financing plans include actions to reduce this uncertainty including  but not limited to  the use of derivative instruments 
we have established policies governing our use of derivative instruments 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes  nor are we a party to any leveraged derivative instruments or any instruments of which the fair market values are not available from independent third parties 
we manage counter party risk by entering into derivative contracts only with major financial institutions of investment grade credit rating and by limiting amount of exposure to each financial institution 
the terms of certain derivative instruments contain a credit clause where each party has a right to settle at market if the other party is downgraded below investment grade 
as of december   the fair market value of all such contracts was an million asset  all of which were held by investment grade financial institutions 
we enter into derivative contracts based on economic analysis of underlying exposures  anticipating that adverse impacts on future earnings  cash flows and fair values due to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices will be offset by the proceeds from and changes in the fair value of the derivative instruments 
our exposure to market risk is not hedged in a manner that completely eliminates the effects of changing market conditions on earnings  cash flows and fair values 
sensitivity analysis is used as a primary tool in evaluating the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates  interest rates and commodity prices on our business operations 
the analyses assume simultaneous shifts in those rates and quantifies the impact of such shifts on our earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities during a one year period 
the range of changes used for the purpose of this analysis reflects our view of changes that are reasonably possible over a one year period 
fair values are the present value of projected future cash flows based on market rates and chosen prices 
foreign exchange rate risk short term exposures to changing foreign exchange rates are primarily due to operating cash flows denominated in foreign currencies and transactions denominated in non functional currencies 
known and anticipated external transactions and operating exposures are covered by using foreign exchange option  forward and swap contracts 
most significant foreign currency exposures are related to western european countries primarily germany  france  italy  netherlands  the united kingdom  sweden and switzerland  as well as brazil  mexico  canada  japan  taiwan  china and australia 
we conduct a sensitivity analysis on the fair value of our foreign currency hedge portfolio assuming an instantaneous change in foreign currency exchange rates from their levels as of december   with all other variables held constant 
a appreciation or depreciation of the us dollar against foreign currencies would increase or decrease by million the fair value of foreign currency hedging contracts held at december  the sensitivity in fair value of the foreign currency hedge portfolio represents changes in fair values estimated based on market conditions as of december   without reflecting the effects of underlying anticipated transactions 
when those anticipated transactions are realized  actual effects of changing foreign currency exchange rates could have a material impact on earnings and cash flows in future periods 

table of contents long term exposures to foreign exchange rate risk are managed primarily through operational activities 
our products are manufactured in a number of locations around the world and have a cost base in a variety of european  asian and latin american currencies 
additionally  we finance operations outside of the united states in local currencies 
such a diverse base of local currency costs and financings serves to partially counterbalance the impact of changing foreign currency exchange rates on earnings  cash flows and fair values of assets and liabilities 
interest rate risk we are exposed to changes in interest rates primarily due to our financing  investing and cash management activities  which include long and short term debt to maintain liquidity and fund business operations 
our current strategic policy is to maintain from to of floating rate debt 
a basis point increase in interest rates would reduce the fair value of interest rate sensitive liabilities including short and long term debt by million  net of derivative contracts outstanding as of december  a basis point decrease in interest rates will increase the fair value by million 
however  such changes in fair values would not have a material impact on our earnings per share or cash flows as the majority of our debt portfolio at december  consisted of fixed rate instruments 
a basis point movement is equivalent to approximately of our weighted average rate on our worldwide debt 
commodity price risk we purchase certain raw materials and energy sources such as natural gas  propylene  acetone  butanol and styrene under short and long term supply contracts 
the purchase prices are generally determined based on prevailing market conditions 
changing raw material and energy prices have historically had material impacts on our earnings and cash flows in the past  and will likely continue to have significant impacts on earnings and cash flows in future periods 
commodity derivative instruments are used to reduce portions of commodity price risks 
assuming a change in the underlying commodity price  the potential change in the fair value of commodity derivative contracts held at december  approximates million  which would not be material when compared with our earnings and financial position 
forward looking statements this market risk discussion and the estimated amounts presented are forward looking statements that assume certain market conditions known at december  actual results in the future may differ materially from these projected results due to changes in business climate  economic and competitive uncertainties  future acquisitions activities and any unforeseen developments in relevant financial markets  including asia and latin america 
the methods used above to assess risk should not be considered projections of expected future events or results
