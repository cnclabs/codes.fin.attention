item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations liquidity and capital resources 
nonetheless  the company expects to explore and test alternative platforms for re establishing growth within the company 
costs for conversion of existing stores to the new prototype design  as well as the timing of renovations of existing stores  will depend on a variety of factors  including the success of the new prototype 
as conditions allow  the company intends to consider increasing the number of shopko retail stores to achieve economies of scale and to capitalize on the company s existing infrastructure 
the company currently plans to resume opening new shopko stores in existing markets in the company s plans with respect to new store growth are subject to change  and there can be no assurances that the company will achieve its plans 
competition shopko retail the discount general merchandise business is very competitive 
shopko competes in most of its markets with a variety of national  regional and local discount stores  national category killers  specialty niche retailers  catalog merchants and internet retailers 
in addition  department stores compete with some branded merchandise lines  discount specialty retail chains compete with some merchandise lines such as health and beauty aids  household cleaning and supplies  electronics  bed and bath  housewares  casual furniture and toys  and pharmaceutical and optical operations compete with some of shopko s pharmacy and optical centers 
shopko believes that the principal competitive factors in its markets include store location  differentiated merchandising  competitive pricing  quality of product selection  attractiveness and cleanliness of the stores  responsiveness to changing lifestyle needs and regional and local trends  customer service  in stock availability of merchandise  and advertising 
shopko s principal national general merchandise discount chain competitors are wal mart  kmart and target  each of which is substantially larger than  and has greater resources than  the company 
the percentage of shopko stores where these competitors are present within the applicable market is as follows wal mart kmart target shopko also competes with regional chains in some markets in the midwest and the pacific northwest 
these competitors continue to open new stores in shopko s markets 
historically  the entry of one of these chains into an area served by a shopko store generally has had an adverse effect on the affected store s sales growth for approximately months 
after the month time period  the shopko store generally has resumed a positive growth trend  although not necessarily to previous levels 
entry by one of these competitors into a shopko market often has resulted in permanently intensified price competition 
in addition  shopko store sales are generally negatively affected by a competitor s increased saturation through expansion  relocation and additional stores in an existing market 
the company s efficiency measures and distribution center expenditures are important aspects of shopko s efforts to maintain or improve operating margins and market share in these markets 
seasonality shopko retail shopko s retail general merchandise operations are highly seasonal 
historically  shopko s third and fourth fiscal quarters have contributed a significant part of the company s earnings due to the christmas selling season 
pamida retail on july   the company acquired all of the outstanding voting and nonvoting common stock of pamida  inc pamida for million in cash  million in assumed debt and million in assumed trade and other accrued liabilities 
pamida is a retail chain headquartered in omaha  nebraska 
merchandising philosophy pamida retail pamida s strategy is to offer consumers in small  rural communities a convenient one stop shopping format 
a typical store carries a broad assortment of value priced softlines and hardlines merchandise  including consumables  and of pamida s stores have retail pharmacies 
pamida stores generally are located in small towns where there often is less competition from another major general merchandise retailer and which pamida considers to be either too small to support more than one major general merchandise retailer thereby creating a potential barrier to entry by a major competitor or too small to attract competitors whose stores generally are designed to serve larger populations 
pamida s merchandising strategy is to provide customers with a reliable and convenient family shopping experience featuring nationally advertised brand name products as well as select private label merchandise at competitive prices 
pamida stores are self service 
advertising circulars are run weekly 
pamida places special emphasis on maintaining a strong in stock position in all merchandise categories 
merchandising and services pamida retail the pamida retail store net sales mix for the last three fiscal years was hardlines softlines pharmacy pamida s softlines division includes men s  women s  children s and infant s clothing  men s and women s footwear  jewelry and accessories  and cosmetics 
pamida s hardlines division includes categories such as home furnishings  seasonal  hardware  consumables  domestics  health and beauty aids  electronics  automotive  and lawn and garden  toys 
as of february   pamida owned and operated pharmacies in of its stores with an additional two pharmacies leased to and operated by independent pharmacists 
the pharmacies have proven to be effective in building customer loyalty and attracting customers who are likely to purchase other items in addition to prescription drugs 
pamida intends to aggressively grow its pharmacy base  looking to add to pharmacies per year for the next couple of years 
marketing and advertising pamida retail pamida s advertising primarily utilizes colorful weekly circulars coordinated by an internal advertising staff 
circulars advertise brand name and other merchandise at competitive prices 
pamida retail store layout and design the company tests various alternative layouts and merchandising mixes for its pamida stores and is currently remodeling several stores to reduce the space devoted to softlines  with more space to be devoted to consumables and convenience oriented items 
if the test is successful  more stores will be converted to the newer design 
pamida historically has invested approximately to million in building a new store  but is currently exploring the less expensive alternative of leasing existing retail locations for expansion and growth 
the risks associated with this alternative will be minimized through the negotiation of shorter lease terms and options for lease extensions 
pamida s stores average approximately  square feet of sales area and range in size from approximately  to  square feet of sales area 
historically  pamida has used a  square foot prototype when building new stores  but will continue to make adjustments to its prototype as it identifies new strategies and trends 
pamida retail store operations and management the methods pamida employs to build customer loyalty and satisfaction are weekly advertised specials  competitive pricing  clean and orderly stores and friendly  well trained personnel 
purchasing and distribution pamida retail pamida maintains a centralized purchasing  merchandise allocation and space planning staff at its central offices 
pamida s point of sale data equipment provides current information to pamida s buyers and inventory management specialists to assist them in managing inventories  effecting prompt reorders of popular items  eliminating slow selling merchandise and reducing markdowns 
centralized purchasing enables pamida to more effectively control the cost of merchandise and to take advantage of promotional programs and volume discounts offered by certain vendors 
pamida continuously seeks to optimize merchandise costs 
pamida purchases merchandise from more than  vendors 
pamida s ten largest vendors accounted for approximately of pamida s purchases during fiscal pamida believes that most merchandise  other than branded goods  is available from a variety of sources 
pamida is working with its entire supply chain to link its vendors into pamida s general merchandise business planning process to reduce costs and to replenish its inventory more efficiently 
the majority of pamida s vendors are linked to its electronic data interchange purchase order systems 
select vendors electronically receive point of sale information from pamida  which allows them to respond to changing inventory levels in the stores 
in addition  the majority of pamida s vendors are electronically transmitting invoices directly into the company s automated invoice matching system 
pamida has entered into an agreement with payless shoesource  inc to be the primary vendor within the shoe category 
purchasing and distribution of merchandise is a critical aspect of pamida s business 
the company controls the flow of main store merchandise through the use of centralized purchasing  replenishment and allocation processes and information systems 
allocation and distribution management is closely tied to the merchandise buying organization to effectively control and plan merchandise logistics 
pamida s pharmacy merchandise is replenished primarily through the use of a distributor 
pharmacies are electronically linked to the distributor and place orders  as product is needed 
direct imports accounted for approximately of pamida s purchases  based upon cost of goods  during fiscal pamida buys its imported goods principally in the far east and ships the goods to its distribution centers for distribution to the stores 
pamida operates distribution facilities in omaha  nebraska and lebanon  indiana  both of which serve primarily as distribution centers for bulk shipments and promotional and replenishment merchandise on which cost savings can be realized through quantity purchasing 
during fiscal  approximately of pamida s merchandise  excluding pharmaceutical products  was distributed to the stores through these distribution centers  while the remaining merchandise was supplied directly to the stores by manufacturers or distributors 
the primary omaha distribution facility is  square feet 
pamida owns another distribution center in omaha  which is  square feet and is used primarily as a cross dock operation for seasonal merchandise 
the lebanon distribution center is  square feet and is used as a full service operation providing both full case and less than case merchandise distribution  similar to the primary omaha facility 
management information systems pamida retail similar to shopko  pamida employs an up to date suite of integrated retail information systems  including merchandise procurement  inventory management  automated replenishment  merchandise and space planning  warehouse management  pharmacy management and point of sale 
in fiscal  the company consolidated pamida s data center and information technology support functions into the corporate headquarters in green bay  wisconsin 
in addition  during fiscal  pamida completed a major upgrade of its core merchandise management system and is in the process of implementing a centralized pharmacy claims management system 
expansion pamida retail on june   the company acquired the retail chain  pm place stores company places  which operated discount stores in missouri  iowa  kansas  and illinois 
forty eight of these stores were reopened as pamida stores  and one places store  located in an existing pamida location  was closed 
during fiscal  pamida opened new stores  including the converted places stores  and closed four stores 
during fiscal  four additional stores were closed 
during fiscal  pamida closed two stores  decreasing the total number of pamida stores to as of february  the company does not currently anticipate pursuing significant growth of the pamida retail business in fiscal through the addition of new stores 
however  the company does plan on expanding pharmacy locations in existing pamida retail stores and is examining the possibility of leasing existing retail locations as described earlier 
the company intends to return to modest store growth as conditions allow  and the company has identified numerous communities as potential sites for pamida stores and in which it believes it can achieve a leading market position 
there is  however  no assurance that the company will open stores in such communities or on any particular time schedule 
competition pamida retail the general merchandise retail business is highly competitive 
pamida s stores generally compete with other general merchandise retailers  supermarkets  drug and specialty stores  mail order and catalog merchants  internet retailers and  in some communities  department stores 
the type and degree of competition and the number of competitors with which pamida s stores compete vary by market 
pamida stores generally are located in small towns where there is no direct local competition from another major general merchandise retailer in the town  and which may be either too small to support more than one major general merchandise retailer thereby creating a potential barrier to entry by a major competitor or too small to attract competitors whose stores generally are designed to serve larger populations 
the percentage of pamida stores where national general merchandise discount chains are present within miles is as follows wal mart kmart target in recent years pamida s business strategy has been to focus its store expansion program on communities with less likelihood of the entry of a new major competitor  but there can be no assurance that in the future major competitors will not open additional stores in pamida s markets 
seasonality pamida retail pamida s business  like that of most other general merchandise retailers  is seasonal 
first quarter sales are lower than sales during the other three fiscal quarters  while fourth quarter sales amount to approximately of the full year s sales and normally involve a greater proportion of higher margin merchandise 
discontinued operations at the start of fiscal  the company maintained a ownership interest in provantage health services  inc provantage 
provantage provided health benefit management services  pharmacy mail services  vision benefit management services and health information technology and clinical support services 
on june   the company sold its interest in provantage pursuant to a tender offer by a third party to acquire all of the outstanding shares of provantage 
for financial information regarding the sale  see note a of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
consolidated employees the company employs approximately  persons in its shopko division  of whom approximately  are full time employees and  are part time employees and approximately  persons in its pamida division  of whom approximately  are full time employees and  are part time employees 
during the christmas shopping season  the company typically employs additional persons on a temporary basis 
no employees of the company are covered by collective bargaining agreements 
government regulation the company s pharmacy and optical services business is subject to extensive federal and state laws and regulations governing  among other things licensure and regulation of retail pharmacies and optical centers there are extensive federal and state regulations applicable to the practice of pharmacy and optometry at the retail level 
most states have laws and regulations governing the operation and licensing of pharmacies and optical centers  and regulate standards of professional practice by pharmacy and optical service providers 
these regulations are issued by an administrative body in each state  typically a pharmacy board or board of optometry  which is empowered to impose sanctions for non compliance 
future legislative initiatives legislative and regulatory initiatives pertaining to such healthcare related issues as reimbursement policies  payment practices  therapeutic substitution programs  and other healthcare cost containment issues are frequently introduced at both the state and federal level 
the company is unable to predict accurately whether or when legislation may be enacted or regulations may be adopted relating to the company s pharmacy and optical services operations or what the effect of such legislation or regulations may be 
substantial compliance the company s management believes the company is in substantial compliance with  or is in the process of complying with  all existing statutes and regulations material to the operation of the company s pharmacy and optical services businesses and  to date  no state or federal agency has taken enforcement action against the company for any material non compliance  and to the company s knowledge  no such enforcement against the company is presently contemplated 
forward looking statements and risk factors in accordance with the private securities litigation reform act of  the company can obtain a safe harbor for forward looking statements by identifying those statements and by accompanying those statements with cautionary statements which identify factors that could cause actual results to differ from those in the forward looking statements 
accordingly  the following information contains or may contain forward looking statements information included or incorporated by reference in this annual report on form k  including  without limitation  statements made under item  business  and under item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  information included or incorporated by reference in future filings by the company with the securities and exchange commission sec including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth  acquisition and expansion plans  store layouts and evolving prototypes  financing plans and projected sales  revenues  earnings  costs and capital expenditures  and information contained in written material  releases and oral statements issued by  or on behalf of  the company including  without limitation  statements with respect to growth  acquisition and expansion plans  store layouts and evolving prototypes  financing plans and projected sales  revenues  earnings  costs and capital expenditures 
the company s actual results may differ materially from those contained in the forward looking statements identified above 
factors which may cause such a difference to occur include  but are not limited to  i the impact of recent accounting pronouncements as described herein  ii the risk factors described below  and iii other risks described from time to time in the company s sec filings 
an investment in shopko s common stock or other securities carries certain risks 
investors should carefully consider the risks described below and other risks  which may be disclosed from time to time in shopko s filings with the sec  before investing in shopko s common stock or other securities 
the company has a significant amount of debt  which could adversely affect its business and growth prospects 
at february   the company had approximately million of total debt and lease obligations  including million outstanding on a senior secured credit facility the secured credit facility 
the restrictions and limitations in the secured credit facility  as well as the significant amount of debt in general  could have material adverse effects on the company s business 
for example  it makes it more difficult for the company to obtain additional financing on favorable terms  restricts capital expenditures  requires the company to dedicate a substantial portion of its cash flows from operations to the repayment of its debt and the interest on its debt  limits the company s ability to open new stores or to make acquisitions  limits the company s ability to capitalize on significant business opportunities  makes the company more vulnerable to economic downturns  adverse retail industry conditions and competitive pressures  and subjects the company to certain covenants which restrict its ability to operate its business 
the company finances a significant portion of its operations through vendor financing 
the credit terms provided by the company s vendors are an important source of financing for the company s operations 
future operating performance could negatively impact the favorable credit terms the company now maintains with these vendors 
if the credit terms provided to the company by a significant portion of its vendors were to deteriorate  the company would be materially adversely affected 
the company may not achieve the expected benefits of current or future reorganizations 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company announced a strategic reorganization plan to improve the productivity of its assets and reduce debt 
the plan included store and distribution center closings and a charge to earnings of approximately million 
the company believes that implementation of the plan has resulted in an increase in the company s profitability and efficiency 
however  the analysis underlying this plan involved many variables and uncertainties 
based on the overall softness in the real estate market and an independent valuation analysis  the company determined that an additional million should be added to the reserve in the fourth quarter of the company may not achieve all of the expected benefits of its plan and additional charges may be necessary in the future 
there can be no assurances that additional reorganizations of this nature  together with related charges to earnings  will not be required in the future to improve the productivity and efficiency in the company s shopko and pamida segments 
such reorganizations and charges to earnings could have a material adverse effect on our financial position or results of operations 
the company may be unable to execute its expansion plans  which may have a significant adverse effect on its financial performance and its growth strategy and prospects 
the company considers expansion in the number of its retail stores to be an integral part of its plan to achieve projected operating results in future years 
in an effort to reduce the company s overall debt  as well as to comply with the restrictions and limitations in its secured credit facility  the company does not anticipate opening any significant number of new retail locations in fiscal furthermore  the company expects that any new stores will typically require an extended period of time to reach the sales and profitability levels of its existing stores 
the opening of any new stores does not ensure that those stores will ever be as profitable as existing stores  especially when those new stores are opened in highly competitive markets 
the failure to expand by opening new retail stores as planned and the failure to generate anticipated sales and earnings growth in markets where new stores are opened could have a material adverse effect on the company s future sales growth and profitability 
if the company is not able to remodel its existing store base on schedule or to carry out such plans in a cost effective manner  then the company s results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
the company believes that the identification of new store designs to fit its customers changing lifestyles and preferences and the remodeling of its stores is a necessary aspect of its growth plans 
the failure to upgrade the company s existing retail stores could have a material adverse effect on the company s anticipated sales and profitability 
to the extent the company is able to upgrade its existing stores  the associated expenses could result in a significant impact on our net income in the future and there can be no assurance that these upgrades will generate any of the anticipated benefits 
the company s quarterly performance fluctuates  which may cause volatility or a decline in the price of its securities 
fluctuations in the company s quarterly operating results have occurred in the past and may occur in the future based on a variety of factors  including seasonality in the company s operations  especially during the christmas selling season which has historically contributed a significant part of the company s earnings and primarily impacts the fourth fiscal quarter  inventory imbalances caused by unanticipated fluctuations in consumer demand or inefficiencies in the company s distribution centers and methods  margin rate compression resulting from competitive pricing pressure  increases and decreases in advertising and promotional expenses  changes in the company s product mix  the ability to manage operating expenses  and the competitive and general economic conditions discussed below 
these fluctuations could cause the company s operating results to vary considerably from quarter to quarter and could materially adversely affect the market price of its securities 
competition in the retail industry could limit shopko s growth opportunities and reduce its profitability 
the company competes in the discount retail merchandise business 
this business is highly competitive 
the competitive environment subjects the company to the risk of reduced profitability 
the company competes with other discount retail merchants as well as mass merchants  catalog merchants  internet retailers and other general merchandise  apparel and household merchandise retailers 
the discount retail merchandise business is subject to excess capacity and some of the company s competitors are much larger and have substantially greater resources than the company 
the competition for customers and store locations has intensified in recent years as larger competitors  such as wal mart  kmart and target  have moved into the company s geographic markets 
the company expects a further increase in competition from these national discount retailers 
there can be no assurance the company will be able to continue to compete successfully 
the long term economic effects of us and international political unrest and an extended economic slowdown could negatively affect the company s financial condition 
the existing conflict in iraq  terrorist attacks  the national and international responses to terrorist attacks and other acts of war or hostility have created many economic uncertainties 
these events could adversely affect the company s business and operating results in ways that presently cannot be predicted 
if terrorist attacks  political unrest  international conflict or other factors cause further overall economic decline  the company s financial condition and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
general economic conditions and adverse weather could have a significant adverse effect on the company s business 
the company operates its retail stores in limited regions of the country 
to the extent adverse economic conditions and weather have a regional impact on the regions in which the company operates  the company may be disproportionately susceptible to such factors compared to peers that have a larger  national base of operations 
general economic factors in the regions in which the company operates that are beyond its control may materially adversely affect its forecasts and actual performance 
the factors that may materially adversely affect its forecasts and actual performance include energy prices  interest rates  recession  inflation  deflation  consumer credit availability  consumer debt levels  tax rates and policy  unemployment trends and other matters that influence consumer confidence and spending 
increasing volatility in financial markets may cause these factors to change with a greater degree of frequency and magnitude 
because the company s business is subject to adverse weather conditions in its retail markets  particularly in the midwest  western mountain and pacific northwest regions  its operating results may be unexpectedly and materially adversely affected 
frequent or unusually heavy snow  ice or rain storms in its markets could have a material adverse effect on its sales and earnings and could adversely impact its ability to make scheduled interest payments on its indebtedness 
the company is dependent on the smooth functioning of its distribution network 
the company relies upon the ability to replenish its depleted inventory through deliveries to its distribution centers from vendors  and from the distribution centers to its stores and  to a limited extent  direct to store deliveries from vendors 
problems that cause delays or interruptions in the distribution network could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and results of operations 
labor conditions may have a material adverse impact on its performance 
if the company cannot attract and retain quality employees  its business will suffer 
the company depends on attracting and retaining quality employees 
many of its employees are in entry level or part time positions with historically high rates of turnover 
the company may be unable to meet its labor needs while controlling costs due to external factors such as unemployment levels  minimum wage legislation and changing demographics 
anti takeover provisions in the company s organizational documents and statutes may inhibit premium offers for its common stock 
anti takeover provisions in its amended and restated articles of incorporation  by laws and wisconsin law and its rights plan may deter unfriendly offers or other efforts to obtain control of the company 
this could make the company less attractive to a potential acquirer and deprive its shareholders of opportunities to sell their shares of common stock at a premium price 
pending or future changes in federal  state or local laws or regulations could negatively impact the company 
various aspects of the company s operations are subject to federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations 
any of these laws  rules or regulations could change at any time 
such changes could have the effect of increasing the company s exposure to liabilities  increasing the cost of operations or restricting the ability to set prices 
this is especially true with respect to our pharmacy business  which could be subject to any number of legislative proposals regarding prescription drugs 
pending or future litigation could subject the company to significant monetary damages 
if the company becomes subject to liability claims that are in excess of its insurance coverage or are not covered by its insurance policies  the company may be liable for damages and other expenses which could have a material adverse effect on its business  operating results and financial condition 
in addition  any claims against the company  regardless of merit or eventual outcome  may have a material adverse effect on its reputation and business 
the sale of retail merchandise and provision of in store pharmacy and optical services entail a risk of litigation and liability 
the company is currently subject to a number of lawsuits  and expects that from time to time it will be subject to similar suits in the ordinary course of business 
the company currently maintains insurance intended to cover a majority of liability claims  subject to a  deductible for general liability claims and for liability claims arising from prescription dispensing errors 
the company believes that its insurance coverage is adequate 
the company cannot assure that it will be able to maintain appropriate types or levels of insurance in the future  that adequate replacement policies will be available on acceptable terms  or that insurance will cover all claims against the company

some of these lawsuits involve claims for substantial amounts 
although the ultimate outcome of these lawsuits cannot be ascertained at this time  it is the opinion of management  after consultation with counsel  that the resolution of such suits will not have a material adverse effect on the consolidated financial statements of the company 
in addition  the company is involved in two purported class action lawsuits 
first  during fiscal  the company was added as a defendant in a purported class action the provantage action filed may  in the circuit court of the state of wisconsin for waukesha county by james jorgensen allen v 
provantage health services  case no 
cv  an alleged stockholder of provantage health services  inc provantage 
the original complaint in the provantage action the original complaint named provantage and the directors of provantage as defendants the original defendants and alleged  among other things  that provantage s directors breached their fiduciary duties in connection with the sale of provantage to merck co  inc merck  and the proposed price for provantage s common stock did not represent the true value of provantage 
on or about august   an amended complaint the amended complaint was filed in the provantage action which  among other things  added the company as a defendant 
the amended complaint alleges  among other things  that the company aided and abetted the original defendants in breaching their fiduciary duties 
the amended complaint requests that the circuit court  among other things  declare that the provantage action is a proper class action  rescind the tender offer merger pursuant to which provantage was purchased by merck  and award compensatory monetary damages  including reasonable attorneys and experts fees 
second  during fiscal  alleged shareholders of the company filed purported class action securities lawsuits against the company and its then chief executive officer containing substantially identical claims in the federal district court for the eastern district of wisconsin 
the suits were consolidated into one action in re shopko s securities litigation no 
c ed wis 
the action alleges that the company and its former chief executive officer  william podany  made various misrepresentations and omissions in public disclosures concerning the company between march  and november  specifically  it is alleged that the company failed to disclose that the company was experiencing significant shipping and inventory control problems at the pamida distribution facility in lebanon  indiana 
the complaints request  among other things  that the court declare the action is a proper class action and award compensatory monetary damages  including reasonable attorneys fees and experts fees 
on or about february   the court granted  in part  the company s motion to dismiss the action  ruling that all allegations are dismissed except those based on statements made in connection with an earnings warning on october  as a result of the court s ruling  the class period and potential class is significantly narrowed 
the company believes the above described actions to be without merit and the company intends to contest all allegations set forth 
there can be no assurances  however  with regard to the outcome of the actions

changes in pamida comparable store sales in fiscal by category were as follows pharmacy   hardlines   and softlines  
the company believes the soft retail environment  a decline in consumer confidence and increased competition in certain of its markets  as well as an increasingly promotional environment  especially in the fourth quarter  negatively affected sales 
generating sales growth is a company priority  which will be challenging in the current environment 
the company does not expect changes in consumer sentiment or competitive intrusion in the near future 
to address this priority  the company has implemented management changes and initiated store development plans to focus on our strong retail health segment and to strengthen the performance in hardlines and softlines 
moreover  the company will continue to refine merchandising and advertising techniques in this challenging environment 
there can be no assurance that such efforts will succeed

shopko s gross margin as a percent of net sales was percent for fiscal compared with percent for fiscal shopko retail gross margins were favorably impacted by a reduction in the lifo reserve of million for fiscal and million for fiscal shopko s gross margin dollars increased percent to million for the same period

pamida s gross margin dollars increased percent to million for the same period 
pamida retail gross margins were favorably impacted by a reduction in the lifo reserve of million for fiscal and million for fiscal the improvement in pamida s gross margin was primarily attributable to reduced shrink expense  better merchandise margin rates and reduced distribution expense  partially offset by lower vendor allowances and a lower lifo reserve reduction 
the company believes that better inventory management is benefiting gross margin in both divisions 
the improvement in margin helped to offset the sales decline  but the company does not expect to see the same kind of improvement in future periods

pamida s selling  general and administrative expenses as a percent of net sales were percent for fiscal compared with percent in fiscal the increases at both divisions were primarily attributable to a lack of sales leverage  increases in employee incentive plans and liability insurance costs  and one time expense obligations relating to employment contracts and severance agreements 
notwithstanding the margin management and tight expense controls  operating profit has been adversely affected by the decline in sales in recent years  making continued focus on margin and expenses a management priority

the company will attempt to continue to reduce its outstanding debt  but anticipates smaller reductions in future periods

continuing operations consolidated net sales for fiscal decreased to billion  compared with billion for fiscal this decrease was due to store closures in fiscal and an additional week of sales in the prior year

in addition  shopko retail comparable store sales weeks versus weeks increased  compared to a increase in the prior year 
changes in comparable store sales in fiscal by category were as follows retail health   hardlines   and softlines  
pamida retail store sales have been included in consolidated net sales since their acquisition in july but they were not included in retail comparable store sales until fiscal pamida retail store sales for the weeks ended february  were million and sales for the weeks ended february  were million

pamida retail comparable store sales weeks versus weeks decreased 
changes in comparable store sales in fiscal by category were as follows retail health   hardlines   and softlines  
changes in retail comparable store sales for a year are based upon those stores that were open for the entire preceding fiscal year

the pamida retail gross margin as a percent of sales was for fiscal compared to for fiscal pamida retail gross margins were favorably impacted by a reduction in the lifo reserve of million for fiscal and million for fiscal the decrease in gross margin rate is primarily attributable to increased inventory shrinkage and distribution costs including freight  partially offset by the favorable lifo adjustment 
consolidated selling  general and administrative expenses sg a  as a percent of sales  were in fiscal compared to in fiscal in fiscal  sg a includes a million impairment charge related to the closure and planned sale of pamida s bethany distribution center and a million impairment charge for an office building held for sale 
shopko retail selling  general and administrative expenses were and of net sales in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
comparable amounts for pamida retail were for both fiscal and fiscal the improvement in the shopko retail segment and on a consolidated basis is primarily due to savings related to corporate restructuring initiatives 
in fiscal  the company incurred special charges of million consisting of million for integration and employee retention costs associated with the pamida acquisition and million for store conversion costs associated with the places acquisition 
in addition  the company recorded a million restructuring charge in the fourth quarter of fiscal which is further described in critical accounting policies and estimates and note c of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
net interest expense for the weeks ended february  was million  or of net sales  compared to million  or of net sales  for fiscal critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires the appropriate application of certain accounting policies  many of which require management to make estimates and assumptions about future events and their impact on amounts reported in our financial statements and related notes 
since future events and their impact cannot be determined with certainty  the actual results will inevitably differ from our estimates 
such differences could be material to the financial statements 
management believes its application of applicable accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
management periodically reevaluates these accounting policies and estimates in the preparation of our financial statements and makes adjustments when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies which are described below 
merchandise inventory 
our merchandise inventory is carried at the lower of cost or market on a last in  first out lifo basis 
the valuation of inventories at cost requires certain management judgments and estimates  including among others  an assessment of any excess inventory levels  lower of cost or market and shrinkage rates 
these assumptions can have a significant impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
restructuring reserve 
in connection with the reorganization plan announced in the fourth quarter of fiscal to close shopko retail stores  a distribution center  and to downsize its corporate workforce  the company incurred a pre tax charge of million  including million related to inventory and property write downs  million related to lease termination and property carrying costs  and million for employee separation and other costs 
the decision to close the facilities was based on management s determination that the long term future economic cost of continuing to operate such facilities would be more costly than closing them 
the company closed all stores and the distribution center in fiscal and the inventory and fixed asset write down reserves were recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company utilized all of the employee severance reserve prior to fiscal of the properties covered by the restructuring reserve  six were disposed of in fiscal  nine were disposed of in fiscal and nine remain undisposed 
the amount of the asset write downs and reserves for lease termination and property carrying costs are based in part on management s estimates as to the timing for disposition of  sales proceeds from  and disposition costs of the closed facilities 
the company s intention has been  and continues to be  to relieve all obligations associated with the closed facilities 
due to continuing softness in the retail climate in general  as well as a growing number of vacant retail properties coming on the market as the company s competitors continue to restructure and downsize their operations  in the fourth quarter of fiscal the company utilized a real estate consulting firm to evaluate the lease obligations of the remaining four closed stores and potential sales prices for the remaining five owned closed store properties 
based on this evaluation  the company lowered the estimated valuations of the properties and believes disposition of some properties may take longer than originally estimated 
as a result  the company took a million pre tax additional impairment charge on the owned properties and a million additional charge for future lease obligations on the leased properties in the fourth quarter of fiscal as of february   the remaining reserve for lease termination and related property carrying costs  as well as other costs  was million and the remaining property write down reserve was million 
with the adjustments described above  the company believes the reserves are adequate 
the company continues to negotiate lease terminations with landlords and actively market closed stores for sale 
however  due to a soft retail real estate market and the number of available properties on the market  sales of owned stores and lease terminations have been slower than anticipated 
accordingly  the level of reserves could prove to be inadequate such that additional charges may be required 
the company will continue to evaluate the adequacy of the amounts reserved as it proceeds with the disposition of the real estate and termination of the leases 
vendor allowances 
the company records vendor allowances and discounts in the income statement when the purpose for which those monies were designated is fulfilled 
allowances provided by vendors generally relate to profitability of inventory recently sold and  accordingly  are reflected as reductions of cost of merchandise sold 
vendor allowances received for advertising or fixturing programs reduce the company s expense for the related advertising or fixturing program 
liquidity and capital resources the company s liquidity requirements are met primarily by cash generated from operations  with remaining funding requirements provided by short term and long term borrowings 
cash provided by operating activities was million  million and million in fiscal  and  respectively 
the decrease in fiscal resulted primarily from a diminished rate of inventory reduction a decrease of million in fiscal versus a decrease of million in 
the significant increase in fiscal was due to the company s efforts to reduce inventory levels decrease of million in fiscal  versus an increase of million in fiscal 
the company finances a significant portion of its operations through vendor financing 
as of february   accounts payable totaled million 
the company currently maintains favorable terms with its vendors  however these terms could be impacted based on the company s future operating performance 
as of february   the company had million of senior unsecured notes outstanding 
these senior unsecured notes have maturity dates ranging from august to march  with approximately million principal amount of senior unsecured notes maturing between august and november a more detailed description of these notes is contained in note e of the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
subject to certain limitations set forth in our secured credit facility described below  proceeds of the secured credit facility or funds from other sources may be used to retire or repurchase those senior unsecured notes maturing during the term of the secured credit facility 
the company anticipates funding the retirement of the notes due august through a combination of operating cash flow and available borrowings under the secured credit facility 
during fiscal  the company repurchased million in principal amount of the outstanding senior unsecured notes  million due in and million due in payments due under the senior unsecured notes could be accelerated in the event the company defaults on any obligation in excess of million 
in addition to the senior unsecured notes  the company had million outstanding under its secured credit facility as of the end of fiscal compared to million outstanding as of the end of fiscal on march   the company entered into a million senior secured revolving credit and term loan facility secured credit facility  which is secured by the company s inventory and accounts receivable 
the secured credit facility provided for revolving credit borrowings of up to million and a term loan of million  both of which bear interest at the bank s base rate plus a margin of to or the eurodollar rate plus a margin of to  depending on borrowing availability under the facility and the company s operating cash flow 
on december   the company voluntarily terminated the term loan portion of the secured credit facility  reducing the overall commitment under the facility from million to million 
the secured credit facility terminates march   but the facility may be extended for an additional year at the company s option subject to certain conditions 
the secured credit facility prohibits the payment of dividends  limits new indebtedness  repurchases of common stock and capital expenditures  and requires the company to meet financial performance covenants relating to borrowing availability and minimum operating cash flows 
the consequences of failing to comply with the various covenants and requirements range from increasing the interest rate  to restrictions on cash management  to default and acceleration of the debt 
the indebtedness under the secured credit facility can be declared immediately due and payable in the event other company debt in excess of million is accelerated 
during fiscal and and giving effect to the write down of goodwill pursuant to sfas no 
 the company was in compliance with all covenants in the secured credit facility 
during the first quarter of fiscal  the company closed on a million private placement mortgage financing 
the loan has a term of years at an interest rate of percent and is secured by shopko stores and one distribution center 
principal payments are based on a year amortization schedule with a balloon payment due march prepayments are permitted subject to certain penalties 
the loan was used to retire five lease liabilities associated with closed stores controlled by affiliates of the lender  to provide additional liquidity  and to add a layer of longer term debt to the company s capital structure 
the following schedule sets forth the company s contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of february  payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years in thousands long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations capital lease obligations represent the total minimum future obligations inclusive of interest 
operating leases are the aggregate future payments for operating leases as of february   including closed stores 
the company believes that the secured credit facility and expected cash from operations  together with continued favorable vendor credit terms  will provide sufficient liquidity to finance continuing operations  including planned capital expenditures  for fiscal however  if the company s operating results were to deteriorate significantly for whatever reason  or if the company were to require significant additional capital for unexpected events  the company could suffer liquidity problems  which would materially adversely affect its results of operations and financial condition 
furthermore  as described above  the company has a significant amount of debt obligations maturing in the period from august to november while the company believes it will have sufficient liquidity to retire these debt obligations as they mature  there can be no assurance that the company will be able to retire or refinance these obligations 
if the company cannot retire or refinance these obligations as they mature  the company s results of operations and financial condition will be materially adversely affected 
capital expenditures and acquisitions the company spent million on capital expenditures in fiscal  compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the following table sets forth the components of capital expenditures and acquisitions in millions fiscal years ended feb 
 weeks feb

 weeks capital expenditures new stores remodeling and refixturing distribution centers management information and point of sale equipment and systems other total acquisitions the company s projected capital expenditures for fiscal are to million  which will be primarily focused on store remodels including new merchandise initiatives  general maintenance including technology enhancements  pharmacy business expansion and initial development for a new store opening program 
inflation inflation has and is expected to have only a minor effect on the results of the company s operations and internal and external sources of liquidity 
recent pronouncements in january  the emerging issues task force eitf  issued eitf issue no 
 accounting by a customer including a reseller for certain consideration received from a vendor  applicable to fiscal years beginning after december  issue no 
provides accounting guidance on how a customer  including a reseller  should characterize consideration received from a vendor and when to recognize and how to measure that consideration in its income statement 
the company has not completed the process of evaluating the impact of eitf issue however  the company does not expect that its adoption in fiscal will have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements  but it may change the classification of some consideration received from vendors within the consolidated statements of operations 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
it amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
as of february   the company has not elected to expense stock options 
the potential impact on consolidated financial statements of expensing of stock options is disclosed in note a of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that guarantors record the fair value of its obligations under certain guaranties and requires disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements are effective for interim and annual financial statements ending after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this fasb interpretation to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
therefore  sfas no 
eliminates the definition and requirements for recognition of exit costs in eitf no 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on its consolidated financial statements 
the company adopted sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective february  under sfas no 
 the company no longer amortizes goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives 
instead  the carrying value is evaluated for impairment on an annual basis 
during fiscal  based on the analysis of an independent appraiser  the company completed its assessment of the impairment of goodwill of the pamida retail segment in accordance with the guidelines provided by sfas no 
the fair value of the pamida retail segment was determined by the appraiser based on a combination of a discounted cash flow analysis and an analysis of market prices of other retail companies 
the fair values of the underlying assets and liabilities were determined using standard valuation practices  including income capitalization  sales comparisons  market rent analysis  relief from royalty and replacement cost 
as a result of this assessment  the company recorded a charge of million related to the write down of all goodwill recorded on the company s balance sheet  all of which related to the pamida retail segment 
the company has received a report from an independent appraiser containing an analysis of intangible assets with indefinite lives  which primarily consist of a trademark associated with the pamida retail segment 
no impairment was recorded as a result of this assessment 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk because of the level of variable interest rate debt in the company s capital structure  the company is exposed to earnings or cash flow fluctuations due to changes in interest rates 
at february   the company had million of variable rate debt outstanding with a weighted average interest rate of 
this debt exposes the company to changes in interest expense brought about by changes in interest rates 
during fiscal  the monthly average amount borrowed under the variable rate credit facilities was approximately million  and the weighted average interest rate was 
if the weighted average interest rate were to increase by for fiscal  net income would have decreased by approximately million 
at february   the company had fixed rate long term debt totaling million 
as these instruments are fixed rate  they do not expose the company to the possibility of earnings loss or gain due to changes in market interest rates 
in general  fluctuation in the market value of these instruments based on fluctuation in interest rates would impact the company s earnings and cash flows only if the company were to reacquire all or a portion of these instruments prior to their maturity 
management continually monitors the interest rate environment with the objective of lowering borrowing costs without subjecting the company to excessive exposure to fluctuating interest rates
