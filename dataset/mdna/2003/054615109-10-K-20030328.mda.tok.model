item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations acquisitions and divestitures during the fourth quarter of  we sold our automation group  comprised of the fiber automation division fad and automation engineering  inc aei 
on november   we sold the net assets of fad to palomar technologies  inc fad designed and manufactured nano positioning stages and fiber alignment test tools 
fad has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and the related net assets and operating results have been reported separately from continuing operations in all years presented 
revenues applicable to this discontinued operation were million in and million in there were no revenues in on october   we sold all of the stock of aei  a wholly owned subsidiary  to an investor group 
aei designed and manufactured flexible automation systems for the photonics market 
aei has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and the related net assets and operating results have been reported separately from continuing operations in all years presented 
revenues applicable to this discontinued operation were million in  million in and million in aei was merged with axsys on october  on april   we sold all of the stock of our teletrac  inc subsidiary to storage test solutions sts of aurora  colorado 
teletrac  which was based in santa barbara  california  designed and manufactured high performance spin stands that are used in the test and certification of data storage recording heads found in magnetic disk drives 
as a result of the sale  we closed our santa barbara manufacturing facility and relocated our micro positioning stage  laser interferometer and autofocus product lines to our imaging systems division located in rochester hills  michigan 
axsys sold the stock of teletrac in exchange for an interest bearing  note  which provides for payments equal to ten percent of the revenues generated from the sales of spin stands by sts with the balance  if any  due in five years 
because of the uncertain market conditions for data storage products and the terms of the note  axsys has reserved the entire value of this note and will record any principal and interest payments as ordinary income during the period received 
as a result of this sale  an asset impairment and cost of sale charge of million has been included in axsys consolidated statement of operations 
under applicable accounting principles  teletrac has not been treated as a discontinued operation 
during june of  we closed a manufacturing support facility located in manchester  connecticut 
the costs associated with closing the california and connecticut operations are included in continuing operations 
on september   teletrac acquired westlake technology corporation westlake 
this acquisition has been accounted for using the purchase accounting method 
accordingly  the results of westlake have been included in axsys consolidated statement of operations since the date of acquisition 
on march   axsys sold the net assets of the beau interconnect division for million in cash and recorded an after tax gain of approximately million in the first quarter of beau designed and manufactured interconnect devices  barrier terminal blocks and connectors 
beau has been accounted for as a discontinued operation and the related net assets and operating results have been reported separately from continuing operations 
revenues applicable to this discontinued operation during were  results of operations the following tables set forth selected financial data from continuing operations on a consolidated and segment basis for the years ended december    and the segment tables  shown below  exclude one time charges  which are shown separately 
consolidated overview in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales    cost of sales    gross margin    overall sales from continuing operations for the year ended december  decreased compared to and as indicated below  the aerospace and defense segment has seen modest growth over the prior two years while depressed markets have impacted the commercial products and distributed products segments 
aerospace and defense segment in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales    cost of sales    gross margin    sales in the aerospace and defense segment increased for the year ended december  compared to in addition  sales in this segment increased for the year ended december  compared to the increases in revenue are primarily due to increased sales of our beryllium machined products and increased sales of our optical components to the aerospace and defense market 
gross margin as a percent of sales for the year ended december  increased compared to the prior year 
operational improvements  including improved quality  material procurement and facility management  have contributed to improved margins compared to significant improvements in gross margin for the year ended december  compared to were primarily the result of a cost reduction program implemented in june of see note of the consolidated financial statements 
commercial products segment in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales    cost of sales    gross margin    sales in the commercial products segment declined for the year ended december  as compared to  while sales in were down compared to on april   we sold our data storage business in santa barbara  california  which had sales of million in and million in these sales are included in the above table 
additionally  the decline in shipments is partially a result of a general downturn in the market for air bearing scanners  which began in the second quarter of gross margin  as a percent of sales  increased during as compared to  reflecting operational improvements including the closure of the santa barbara facility during the second quarter of and the closure of a manufacturing support facility in connecticut during the second quarter of see note of the consolidated financial statements 
the decline in gross margin from fiscal year compared to was primarily the result of a decline in data storage sales 
distributed products segment in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  sales    cost of sales    gross margin    sales in the distributed products segment declined for the year ended december  as compared to  while sales in fiscal year declined by compared to fiscal year the decline in revenue is driven primarily by the overall weakness in the us economy 
in and  conditions were very weak in the industrial automation and commercial markets for our precision ball bearings  including lower sales to electronic capital equipment markets  which had been particularly strong in gross margin as a percent of sales decreased in compared to  primarily due to additional excess inventory reserves taken in as a result of lower sales volumes 
gross margin  as a percentage of sales  decreased by in fiscal year compared to fiscal year  which was the result of decreased revenues 
adjusting for the inventory reserve adjustments in  gross margin percentages have remained relatively stable despite decreased revenues  as we have reacted to the depressed market conditions by lowering overhead and reducing spending 
one time charges included in cost of sales non allocated in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  one time charges   during  we recorded a one time charge of thousand for the elimination of some small product lines resulting from the closure of the california facility 
during the second quarter of  in conjunction with the cost reduction plan  we recorded a one time charge of million  which primarily included a million charge for excess and obsolete inventory disposals and million charge for loss contract reserves for two long term government contracts 
during the first quarter of  we recorded a one time charge of million when we re evaluated slow moving and potentially obsolete inventory as part of the strategic realignment plan 
these charges are included in cost of sales but are not allocated to a particular segment 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
operating expenses in thousands and as a percentage of sales years ended december  selling  general and administrative expenses   research and development expenses    restructuring and special charges    selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in compared to million in  a net decrease of million 
the decrease is primarily a result of the closure of the california and connecticut facilities  which accounted for savings of million for compared to the prior year  lower incentive compensation as a result of lower revenues and lower overall spending 
sg a expenses were lower in fiscal year compared to fiscal year primarily as a result of the cost reduction plan 
see note of the consolidated financial statements 
research and development expenses 
research and development r d expenses were million in compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the closure of the california and connecticut facilities 
the reduction in r d spending in as compared to is a result of the june closure of the connecticut facility  which was primarily an r d facility 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
restructuring charges 
costs categorized as restructuring charges were million in  million in and million in see note to the consolidated financial statements 
during  restructuring charges included million for termination expenses incurred in connection with the restructuring of the business  million associated with asset write downs and severance expenses resulting from the sale of teletrac and million of costs relating to the relocation of some commercial oem product lines from santa barbara  california to rochester hills  michigan 
during  in conjunction with the cost reduction plan  axsys recorded restructuring charges of million 
the restructuring charges were recorded for severance pay and benefits for sixty employees and exit costs relating to the closing of two facilities 
during  in conjunction with the strategic realignment plan  axsys recorded a restructuring charge of million for a workforce reduction of employees and the relocation or consolidation of two facilities 
other income and expenses interest income and expense  net 
net interest expense was thousand in the year ended december   compared to net interest income of thousand and thousand in and  respectively 
the decline in interest income since is a result of lower prevailing interest rates and lower average investment balances 
in addition  interest income of thousand in  thousand in and thousand in  from a note receivable  has declined as the principal balance has been reduced 
other income and expense  net 
net other income in was thousand compared to other income of thousand in and thousand in during  we recorded a charge of thousand for the disposal of fixed assets 
we also received income of thousand in  thousand in and thousand in  which was recovered from a fully reserved note from the sale of sensor systems 
taxes 
the consolidated effective tax rate for continued and discontinued operations was for the year ended december  compared to in and in the changes in the effective rates are primarily due to the establishment of a valuation allowance partially offset by an anticipated capital loss carry back benefit relating to the sale of teletrac  inc the effective tax rate for discontinued operations in is 
the tax provision for continuing operations for was million primarily as a result of two events 
in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards no 
 in we established a million valuation allowance against our deferred tax asset 
as we record income in the future  we will reduce this valuation allowance accordingly 
the tax expense recorded as a result of the valuation allowance was partially offset by a tax benefit resulting from a permanent book and tax basis difference on the sale of teletrac  inc at december   we continued to recognize a portion of our deferred tax asset as we have a prudent and feasible tax planning strategy  which we would implement before allowing any of our deferred tax benefits to expire 
discontinued operations 
during the third quarter of  we decided to divest our automation group 
we completed the disposal of the group in the fourth quarter of during  we recorded a special charge of million  net of taxes  which included thousand for the impairment of assets and thousand of closing related expenses 
these costs are discussed in more detail in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the loss  net of tax  from these operations included in discontinued operations was million in compared to million in and million in the remainder of the loss from discontinued operations in included a thousand charge for an environmental related expense for a previously divested operation  which was partially offset by thousand of income from the reversal of unutilized reserves primarily associated with the sale of the beau interconnect division in in march  we sold the beau interconnect division 
results of operations from the discontinued business have been reported separately from continuing operations in all periods presented 
the sale of beau resulted in a gain of million before a tax provision of million 
we also recorded a charge of million  before a tax benefit of million  to increase environmental accruals for the remediation of two former operating sites 
during  our environmental consultants advised us to increase these accruals to better reflect the ongoing costs to complete the remediation of these sites 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
net income 
we had a net loss of million in  a new loss of million in and net income of million in during  we sold our automation group  which resulted in a net loss of million including both operating losses and loss on the sale 
in addition  we recorded a tax provision of million from continuing operations  which was primarily the result of the establishment of a valuation allowance to reduce our net deferrred tax assets 
in  we recorded a restructuring and special charge associated with our cost reduction plan of million  net of taxes 
in addition  our automation group incurred a net loss of million 
during  we sold our beau division  which resulted in a net gain of million and recorded a restructuring and special charge associated with our strategic realignment plan of million  net of taxes 
liquidity and capital resources axsys funds its operations primarily from cash flow generated by operations  cash on hand and  to a limited extent  capital lease financing 
as of december   cash and cash equivalents totaled million 
net cash provided by or used in operations was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in  axsys net loss of million included a million deferred tax valuation allowance  million of depreciation and thousand of losses on capital asset disposals 
in  we received a million federal income tax refund 
we also incurred million in cash costs related to our discontinued automation group 
during  we collected million in customer advances for our beryllium based products offset by million in increased inventories for these products 
in  axsys net loss of million was offset by depreciation and amortization of million as well as working capital changes 
accounts receivable declined million  reflecting lower fourth quarter sales in inventory levels declined by million  including the effects of inventory write downs taken with the cost reduction plan 
current tax receivable increased by million  due to an anticipated significant tax refund  which was received in  for net operating losses generated in trade accounts payable declined by million in response to lower production volume and reduced year end capital spending compared to the prior year 
long term liabilities increased million  which was primarily the result of a reserve for a loss on a long term government contract 
in  our net income of million  which included the non operating gain on the sale of beau of million  was offset by depreciation and amortization of million 
axsys made income tax payments of million related to the gain on the sale of beau 
accounts receivable balances increased by million due to higher billings at the end of the fourth quarter in this effect was partially offset by a decrease in inventories and other assets 
net cash used in or provided by investing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
investing activities in were principally related to capital spending of million  which was lower than spending levels in and significant investments in and were focused on upgrading precision machining capabilities and test and measurement equipment for imaging and motion control products 
capital spending in included an investment of million to expand the motion control manufacturing facility as well as investments in telecommunications infrastructure 
in  the major source of funds was the million in gross proceeds from the divestment of beau in march net cash used in financing activities was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
in general  cash used in financing activities is for the repayment of capital leases 
in addition  in  axsys repaid the outstanding balance of million on borrowings under an million senior secured revolving credit facility in conjunction with the sale of beau on march  the credit facility was subsequently terminated 
as of december   axsys had no significant obligations or commitments for capital expenditures other than those arising in the ordinary course of business 
management believes that the company has sufficient funds on hand to finance its operations  capital expenditures  and working capital requirements for the foreseeable future 
the following table reflects a summary of our contractual cash obligations and other commercial commitments as of december  payments due by period contractual cash obligations total less than year to years to years after years in thousands operating leases      capital leases    total      backlog a substantial portion of our business is of a build to order nature requiring various engineering  manufacturing  testing and other processes to be performed prior to shipment 
as a result  a significant portion of our annual sales is in our backlog of orders 
our backlog of orders increased by percent or million  to million at december  from million at december  strong bookings in the aerospace and defense segment during have contributed to our increased backlog 
we believe that a substantial portion of our backlog of orders at december  will be shipped over the next twelve months 
critical accounting policies our significant accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements are described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
the following is a brief discussion of the more significant accounting policies and methods used by us 
general 
the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the most significant estimates and assumptions relate to inventory valuation and the adequacy of allowances for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation  long term loss contract reserves and environmental contingencies 
actual amounts could differ significantly from these estimates 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we periodically review the aging of our accounts receivable over ninety days to identify potentially uncollectible accounts and establish reserves based on experience and discussion with customers 
actual write offs could differ from our allowance for doubtful accounts 
if circumstances change  ie  higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customers ability to meet its financial obligations our estimates of recoverability of amounts due to us could be reduced by a material amount 
inventory valuation 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated market value of the inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess or obsolete inventory based on current requirements and historical usage 
as demonstrated during  demand for our products can fluctuate 
a significant increase in the demand for our products could result in a short term increase in the cost of inventory purchases while a significant decrease in demand could result in an increase in the amount of excess or obsolete inventory quantities on hand 
in addition  some of our industries are characterized by rapid technological change or frequent new product development that could result in an increase in the amount of obsolete inventory on hand 
additionally  our estimates of future product demand may prove to be inaccurate  in which case we may have understated or overstated the provision required for excess or obsolete inventory 
in the future  if our inventory were determined to be overvalued  we would be required to recognize those costs in our cost of goods sold at the time of such determination 
likewise  if our inventory is undervalued  we may have over reported our costs of goods sold in previous periods and would be required to recognize additional operating income at the time of sale 
therefore  although we make every effort to ensure the accuracy of our forecasts of future product demand  any significant unanticipated changes in demand or technological developments could have a significant impact on the value of our inventory and our reported operating results 
long term loss contract reserves two long term contracts are covered by a loss contract reserve 
we accrued for these contracts based on the contract price and the current cost structure 
to the extent future manufacturing costs ie  labor rates and material costs change  our loss contract reserves will be impacted 
environmental contingencies 
we are currently involved in several environmental remediation projects 
we accrue for environmental contingencies when responsibility for clean up is determined and costs are probable and reasonably estimatable 
when costs are not probable and reasonably estimatable  no accrual is made 
as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we have accrued our estimate of the probable costs for the resolution of these claims 
these estimates have been developed in consultation with outside environmental consultants handling these matters and are based upon an analysis of the anticipated remediation plans 
we do not anticipate these projects will have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations could be materially affected by changes in our assumptions 
recently issued accounting standards in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supersedes emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity  including certain costs incurred in a restructuring eitf 
sfas requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
in addition  sfas no 
establishes that fair value is the basis for initial measurement of the liability 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  the effect of adoption of sfas is dependent on our activities subsequent to adoption 
in december  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas amends sfas to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the transition guidance and annual disclosure requirements are effective for fiscal years ending after december  the company adopted the disclosure provisions for this form k 
the company will continue to account for stock based compensation under the provisions of apb opinion no 
accounting for stock issued to employees using the intrinsic value method 
accordingly  the adoption of sfas is not anticipated to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations  or cash flows 
cautionary factors that may affect future results this filing contains forward looking statements within the meaning of section e of the securities exchange act of  as amended  including  without limitation  statements regarding our ability to reduce design and manufacturing lead times and manufacturing costs  our ability to integrate existing technologies  our ability to implement our strategy to develop and sell  among other things  higher level subsystems  the changes to be achieved from our cost reduction efforts  our objective to grow through strategic acquisitions and anticipated expenditures for environmental remediation 
one can identify these forward looking statements by the use of the words such as expect  anticipate  plan  may  will  estimate or other similar expressions 
discussion containing such forward looking statements is found in the material set forth under business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  as well as within the filing generally 
one should understand that many factors could cause actual results to differ from those expressed or implied in the forward looking statements 
these factors include those discussed below as well as inaccurate assumptions 
axsys cautions the reader  however  that this list of factors may not be exhaustive 
risk factors the following risk factors should be considered carefully in addition to the other information contained in this filing 
the aerospace and defense industry  which represents the majority of our sales  is subject to economic cycles 
a significant portion of our business and business development efforts is concentrated in the aerospace and defense industry 
our business depends  in significant part  upon the us government s continued demand in the area of defense for high end  high performance components and subsystems of the type that we manufacture 
approximately of our net sales in  of net sales in and in were derived directly from contracts with the us government  or its agencies or departments  or indirectly from subcontracts with us government contractors 
the majority of these government contracts are subject to termination and renegotiation 
as a result  our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially affected by changes in us government expenditures for defense 
in addition  we cannot assure you that current and future government programs will continue to use our products 
our operating results may vary substantially due to factors that are difficult to forecast 
factors such as announcements of technological innovations or new products by axsys or our competitors  domestic and foreign general economic conditions and the cyclical nature of the industries that we serve could cause substantial variations in our operating results 
the defense  aerospace  semiconductor  electronics capital equipment  high performance graphic art  medical imaging capital equipment  industrial automation oem and mro markets  each of which represents a significant market for our products  have historically been subject to substantial economic fluctuations due to changing demands for their products and services  introduction of new products and product obsolescence 
any future fluctuations arising from these or other conditions could have an adverse impact on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  significant fluctuations in our quarterly and annual operating results due to a variety of factors  including market acceptance of new and enhanced versions of our products timing and shipment of significant orders mix of products sold length of sales cycles plant openings and closings the timing of acquisitions or dispositions delays in raw materials shipments  as well as other manufacturing delays and disruptions  completion of large projects the level of backlog of orders domestic and foreign general economic conditions  and demand in the markets that we serve to some extent  primarily in our bearing distribution division  our net sales and operating results for a specific quarter will depend upon generating orders to be shipped in the same quarter in which the order is received 
the failure to receive anticipated orders or delays in shipments near the end of a particular quarter  due  for example  to unanticipated rescheduling or cancellations of shipments by our customers or unexpected manufacturing difficulties  may cause our net sales in a particular quarter to fall significantly below expectations  which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations for such quarter 
the rapid pace of technological change will require continuous new product development 
our success will continue to depend in substantial part upon our ability to introduce new products that keep pace with technological developments and evolving industry standards and to apply appropriate levels of engineering  research and development resources necessary to keep pace with these developments 
in addition  our success will depend on how well we respond to changes in customer requirements and achieve market acceptance for our products and capabilities 
any failure by axsys to anticipate or respond adequately to technological developments and customer requirements could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in order to develop new products successfully  we are dependent upon close relationships with our customers and their willingness to share proprietary information about their requirements and participate in collaborative efforts with us 
we cannot assure you that our customers will continue to provide us with timely access to information or that we will be successful in developing and marketing new products and services or their enhancements 
in addition  we cannot assure you that the new products and services or their enhancements  if any  that we develop  will achieve market acceptance 
our markets are extremely competitive 
we compete primarily on the basis of our ability to design and engineer our products to meet performance specifications set by our customers  most of whom are oems who purchase component parts or subsystems for inclusion in their end products 
product pricing and quality  customer support  experience  reputation and financial stability are also important competitive factors 
there are a limited number of competitors in each of the markets for the various types of precision optical and positioning components and subsystems that we sell 
our competitors  especially those in the precision optical and positioning product lines  are typically focused on a smaller number of product offerings than we are  and they are often well entrenched 
some of our competitors have substantially greater resources than we do 
our competitors could develop enhancements to or future generations of competitive products that will offer superior price or performance features to ours 
in addition  new processes or technologies could emerge that render our products less competitive or obsolete 
in addition  a substantial investment is required by an existing or potential customer to integrate components and subsystems into their product design 
we believe that once a customer has selected particular components or subsystems from one vendor  the customer generally relies upon that vendor to provide equipment for the specific product application and may seek to rely upon that vendor to meet other component or subsystem requirements 
accordingly  axsys may be at a competitive disadvantage with respect to a prospective customer that chooses to utilize a competitor s components or subsystems 
further  there are numerous competitors in markets to which we distribute precision ball bearings 
our competitors  who vary in size  include other ball bearings distributors as well as ball bearing manufacturers 
the bases of competition in the industries in which we compete could shift and we may not be able to compete successfully 
our levels of international sales and purchases could pose risks to our operating results 
our international sales from continuing operations accounted for approximately of net sales in  in  and in in addition  our products are sold to domestic customers who use them in products they sell to international markets 
also  we purchase a substantial portion of our ball bearing products from two foreign suppliers and certain other products from other foreign suppliers 
our international sales and purchases are subject to a number of risks generally associated with international operations  including general economic conditions  import and export duties and restrictions  currency fluctuations  changes in regulatory requirements  tariffs and other barriers  political and economic instability and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any of these factors could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we may not be able to successfully manage expanded operations and acquisitions 
as part of our business development strategy  we plan to pursue acquisitions in order to expand our product offerings  add to or enhance our base of technical and sales personnel or provide desirable customer relationships 
this growth could result in a significant strain on our managerial  financial  engineering and other resources 
the rate of our future expansion  if any  in combination with the complexity of the technologies involved in our businesses  may demand an unusually high level of managerial effectiveness in anticipating  planning  coordinating and meeting our operational needs as well as the needs of our customers 
additionally  we cannot assure you that axsys will be able to acquire complementary businesses on a cost effective basis  integrate acquired operations into our organization effectively  retain and motivate key personnel  or retain customers of acquired firms 
we compete for attractive acquisition candidates with other companies or investors  and that competition could increase the cost of pursuing our acquisition strategy or reduce the number of attractive candidates to be acquired 
although axsys reviews and considers possible acquisitions on an on going basis  no specific acquisitions are being negotiated or planned as of the date of this report 
many key product components come from single source suppliers 
a significant portion of our precision machining business depends on the adequate supply of specialty metals  such as beryllium  at competitive prices and on reasonable terms 
we currently procure all of our beryllium from brush wellman  the sole us supplier  and expect to continue to rely on brush wellman for beryllium for the foreseeable future 
although we have not experienced significant problems with our supplier in the past  we cannot assure you that such relationship will continue or that we will continue to obtain such supplies at cost levels that would not adversely affect our gross margins 
the partial or complete loss of brush wellman as a supplier of beryllium  or production shortfalls or interruptions that otherwise impair our supply of beryllium  would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
it is uncertain whether alternative sources of supply could be developed without a material disruption in our ability to provide beryllium products to our customers 
although we have not experienced significant problems with our other suppliers in the past  we cannot assure you that such relationships will continue or that  in the event of a termination of our relationships with those other suppliers  we would be able to obtain alternative sources of supply without a material disruption in our ability to provide products to our customers 
in addition  we purchase a substantial amount of ball bearings that we distribute from two foreign suppliers 
any material disruption in our supply of products would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations 
our future success depends on our ability to retain key personnel 
axsys success depends to a significant extent on the continued services of our key executive officers and senior management personnel 
the loss of the services of one or more of these individuals may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we do not maintain key man life insurance on our executive officers 
in addition  since our continued success is largely dependent upon our ability to design  manufacture and sell high performance components and subsystems for the high performance technology market  we are particularly dependent upon our ability to identify  attract  motivate and retain qualified technical personnel  including engineers and skilled machinists  with the requisite educational background and industry experience 
our employees may voluntarily terminate their employment with us at any time  and competition for personnel is intense 
accordingly  we cannot assure that we will be successful in retaining our existing personnel 
the loss of the services of a significant number of our technical or skilled personnel  or the future inability to attract technical or skilled personnel  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must protect our intellectual property rights 
the patents of competitors could impact our business 
our ability to compete effectively with other companies will depend  in part  on our ability to maintain the proprietary nature of our technology 
we rely upon a combination of patents  trademarks and trade secrets  non disclosure agreements and other forms of intellectual property protection to safeguard our proprietary technology 
we cannot assure you as to the degree of protection offered by these patents 
we also cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain the confidentiality of our trade secrets or that our non disclosure agreements will provide meaningful protection of our trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information in the event of any unauthorized use  misappropriation or disclosure of such trade secrets  know how or other proprietary information 
competitors in the united states and foreign countries  many of which have substantially greater resources than we do and have made substantial investments in competing technologies  may have applied for or obtained  or may in the future apply for and obtain  patents that will prevent  limit or interfere with our ability to make and sell some of our products 
although we believe that our existing products do not infringe on the patents or other proprietary rights of third parties  third parties could assert infringement claims against us and such claims could be successful 
we must comply with strict environmental regulations  both compliance and non compliance could result in material liabilities or costs 
we are subject to a variety of federal  state and local laws  rules and regulations relating to the use  storage  discharge and disposal of hazardous chemicals used during our engineering  research and development and manufacturing activities 
failure to comply with applicable environmental requirements could result in substantial liability to axsys  suspension or cessation of our operations  restrictions on our ability to expand our operations or requirements for the acquisition of additional equipment or other significant expense  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we cannot assure you a that changes in federal  state or local laws  regulations or regulatory policy  or the discovery of unknown problems or conditions  will not in the future require substantial expenditures  or b as to the extent of our liabilities  if any  for past failures  if any  to comply with applicable environmental laws  regulations and permits  any of which also could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
during  axsys recorded a charge to discontinued operations of million  before a tax benefit of million  relating to increases in reserves for certain environmental costs associated with formerly owned properties 
the current accruals of million associated with these sites assume that various approvals will be received from state regulatory authorities 
however  we cannot assure you that we will receive these approvals 
if these approvals are not received  our costs could increase substantially 
in addition  even if such approvals are received  the costs actually incurred may exceed the reserves established 
during december  we received a letter from the united states environmental protection agency epa notifying us that we are considered to be a potentially responsible party at a site located in prospect  connecticut  which until was owned by a former subsidiary 
it is our policy to accrue environmental cleanup related costs only when those costs are believed to be probable and can be reasonably estimated 
the quantification of environmental exposure with respect to this site  if any  requires an assessment of many factors  including the quality of information available  the assessment stage of each investigation  preliminary findings and the length of time involved in remediation 
in  axsys recorded a charge to discontinued operations of thousand  net of taxes relating to attorney fees for researching our connection to the site and our response to the epa 
we have made and continue to make investments in protective equipment  process controls  manufacturing procedures and training in order to minimize the risks to our employees  surrounding communities and the environment due to the presence and handling of hazardous materials 
the failure to properly handle these materials could lead to harmful exposure for employees or to the discharge of certain hazardous waste materials 
since axsys does not carry environmental impairment insurance  such a failure could lead to a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
also  environmental problems could develop in the future which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we must continue to invest significant resources to maintain and upgrade our manufacturing capabilities 
we have invested  and intend to continue to invest  in state of the art equipment in order to increase  expand  update or relocate our manufacturing capabilities and facilities 
changes in technology or sales growth beyond currently established manufacturing capabilities would require that we make further investment
