item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations business environment the company is one of the leading international providers of offshore drilling and marine transportation services to the oil and gas industry 
the company s operations are concentrated in the geographic regions of north america  europe west africa  asia pacific and south america caribbean 
demand for the company s services is significantly affected by worldwide expenditures for oil and gas drilling 
expenditures for oil and gas drilling may fluctuate substantially from year to year and from region to region 
such fluctuations result from many factors  including demand for oil and gas  world economic conditions  the legislative environment in the us and other countries in which the company operates  production levels and other activities of opec and other oil and gas producers  and the impact that these and other events have on the current and expected future pricing of oil and natural gas 
the company s domestic offshore drilling operations are conducted in the gulf of mexico 
the us natural gas market and trends in oil company spending largely determine domestic offshore drilling industry conditions 
u 
s natural gas prices increased significantly during  and demand  and ultimately day rates  for offshore drilling rigs increased as many oil companies accelerated drilling programs in response to historically high natural gas prices 
jackup rigs mobilized to the gulf of mexico from international markets to take advantage of this strong demand 
during  natural gas prices decreased from record levels  and oil company gulf of mexico drilling budgets were sharply reduced over the course of the year and remained at moderate levels during currently  demand for jackup drilling rigs in the gulf of mexico is significantly lower than that realized in early although some jackup rigs have now departed the gulf of mexico for international service  the supply of jackup rigs is still in excess of current demand 
as a result of this imbalance  day rates are significantly lower today than they were in and early the company does not expect any significant improvement in domestic day rates during the first half of industry conditions in most international offshore drilling markets have improved over the last two years  as many of the major international and government owned oil companies have increased spending in those markets 
cutbacks in opec production and an improved outlook for oil demand contributed to higher oil prices in and  and a more favorable climate for oil company spending 
although oil prices declined somewhat over the course of  increased drilling activity related to major natural gas development projects in asia pacific and the middle east contributed to increased demand for jackup drilling rigs in those regions 
demand and day rates for international jackup rigs strengthened during and much of  particularly in europe and asia pacific 
however  in the second half of  day rates began to decrease modestly in europe 
day rates for jackups in europe have stabilized to date in at the levels in effect at the end of  but current activity levels could lead to some near term softening of day rates in europe 
recently  concerns related to global economic activity and the impact on oil demand growth have contributed to more modest increases in oil company spending 
uncertainty with regard to the middle east and the political unrest in venezuela have also contributed to cautiousness by oil companies  and this may impact spending plans over the course of although the outlook is uncertain  at this time the company expects day rates and utilization for international jackup rigs to remain relatively stable throughout results of operations on august   the company completed its merger with chiles offshore inc chiles  which has been accounted for as a purchase business combination in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles in the united states  with the company treated as the acquirer 
under the terms of the merger agreement  each chiles shareholder received of a share of the company s common stock and in cash in exchange for each share of chiles common stock held 
upon completion of the transaction  the company issued approximately million shares of its common stock and paid approximately million in cash to the holders of chiles common stock 
the company s financial statements include the operating results of chiles from the august  acquisition date 
the acquired chiles operations consisted of a fleet of five ultra premium jackup rigs  including two rigs operating in the gulf of mexico  one rig operating offshore australia  one rig operating offshore trinidad and tobago  and one rig under construction that subsequently entered service in the gulf of mexico 
the acquisition of chiles further strengthened the company s position in the premium jackup market  which the company believes currently represents one of the strongest segments of the offshore drilling market 
the company s results for as compared to generally reflect a weakened demand for drilling rigs in the gulf of mexico and the resulting decrease in industry day rates 
the reduced operating results in domestic drilling operations are somewhat offset by the continued strength of the company s international operations  particularly in the asia pacific region  where operating results have improved substantially from the prior year as a result of increased day rates and the increased size of the company s asia pacific rig fleet 
the decrease in overall operating results in as compared to is also attributable to a million impairment charge in related to the company s barge rigs in venezuela and million of lump sum  early contract termination payments received in also related to the company s venezuelan operations 
the company s results reflect a continued improvement in industry conditions from those experienced during in  the company experienced improved operating results from both its marine transportation and contract drilling segments  including both domestic and international regions of its contract drilling segment 
the improvement in operating results is primarily attributable to increased day rates and the contributions of the recently constructed ensco and ensco  which commenced drilling operations in december and april  respectively

in  revenues for the ensco increased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  as compared to the increase in revenue is primarily attributable to a increase in average day rates which resulted from contractual rate adjustments that compensate the company for certain cost increases 
the decrease in operating margin is due primarily to higher contract drilling expenses  which increased by million  or  due primarily to costs associated with steel hull repairs during the first quarter of and an increase in insurance costs 
asia pacific barge rig the ensco i  one of the company s larger barge rigs  was mobilized from venezuela in august to a shipyard in singapore for modifications and enhancements to fulfill a long term contract in indonesia 
shipyard modifications were completed  and contract operations commenced  in late december substantially all of the million of revenue for is attributable to the mobilization of the rig from venezuela to the drilling location in indonesia 
south america caribbean barge rigs in  revenues for the south america caribbean barge rigs decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  as compared to the decrease in revenues and operating margin is due primarily to lower utilization  which decreased to in from in the prior year  and the termination of two contracts in in september and november of  a customer elected to terminate two long term contracts after approximately half of the respective five year contract terms had been completed 
the terminations resulted from the customer s disappointing oil production rates from the reservoir and the ensuing reduction in their drilling plans  and were not due to any fault with the company s drilling rigs 
in connection with the two contract terminations  the company received lump sum  early contract termination payments totaling million  all of which was recognized as revenue during contract drilling expenses decreased by million  or  from the prior year due primarily to lower utilization 
in  excluding the million early contract termination revenue discussed above  revenues for the south america caribbean barge rigs increased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  from the increase in revenues is primarily attributable to a increase in average day rates  which resulted from contractual rate adjustments that compensate the company for certain cost increases 
contract drilling expenses increased by million  or  from the prior year  which contributed to a decrease in operating margin 
the increase in contract drilling expenses is primarily due to higher personnel costs resulting from collective contracts with the unions representing petroleum industry personnel in venezuela and to an increase in costs associated with idle rigs 
platform rigs in  revenues for the platform rigs decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  from the decrease in revenues and operating margin is primarily due to two rigs  one of which was idle during compared to being utilized during the prior year and a second rig that earned a minimal standby rate during substantially all of compared to earning a full day rate in contract drilling expenses for the platform rigs decreased by million  or  from the prior year due primarily to the two rigs discussed above 
in  revenues for the platform rigs increased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by  or  as compared to the increase in revenues is primarily due to a increase in average day rates 
contract drilling expenses increased by million  or  from the prior year primarily due to higher personnel related costs 
the contract drilling expenses also increased  and the operating margin declined  as a result of  in nonrecurring reductions in contract drilling expenses in in connection with the favorable resolution of personal injury claims and related disputes with insurance carriers 
marine transportation at december   the company had a marine transportation fleet of vessels  consisting of five anchor handling towing supply ahts vessels and supply vessels 
the company sold one supply vessel during the fourth quarter of all of the company s marine transportation vessels are located in the gulf of mexico 
in  revenues for the company s marine transportation segment decreased by million  or  and operating margin decreased by million  or  from these decreases are primarily attributable to lower average day rates  which decreased from the prior year  and lower utilization  which decreased to in from in marine transportation expenses increased by million  or  from the prior year due primarily to increases in regulatory drydocking costs and insurance costs

these increases are primarily due to higher average day rates for supply vessels  which increased from the prior year  and higher fleet utilization  which increased to in from in marine transportation expenses increased by million  or  from the prior year due primarily to increased utilization and higher personnel related costs 
depreciation and amortization effective january   the company adopted the financial accounting standards board s statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which  among other things  eliminated the requirement to amortize goodwill 
accordingly  the company recognized no goodwill amortization in  compared to million of goodwill amortization in the prior year 
depreciation and amortization expense in increased by million  or  as compared to the increase is primarily attributable to the chiles rigs acquired in august and depreciation on capital enhancement projects completed in and  partially offset by the recognition of million of goodwill amortization in and million of depreciation in the prior year associated with two barge rigs that were taken out of service in december depreciation and amortization expense in increased by million  or  as compared to the increase is primarily attributable to an million increase in depreciation expense associated with the ensco and ensco  which were placed in service in july and december  respectively  and a million increase in depreciation expense associated with the ensco  for which depreciation expense was suspended until november while the rig was undergoing conversion from a water injection unit to a conventional drilling unit 
impairment of assets the company s south america caribbean barge rig fleet operations have historically been concentrated on lake maracaibo in venezuela 
lake maracaibo market conditions have been depressed for several years due to reduced or deferred exploration and development spending by venezuela s national oil company  petroleos de venezuela  sa pdvsa  which resulted from reduced demand for venezuelan oil production  economic decline and opec quota reductions 
in addition  the economic and political situation in venezuela has become increasingly unstable during recent years 
as a result of the uncertainty surrounding its south america caribbean barge rig fleet  the company has evaluated the carrying value of the barge rigs for impairment on a regular basis during recent years 
during the fourth quarter of the economic and political environment in venezuela deteriorated severely 
a strike originating within pdvsa spread nationwide  involving the entire oil industry and the banking system  and causing substantial economic upheaval 
the strike  mass terminations of pdvsa employees  and political interference in the management of pdvsa resulted in the near shutdown of the venezuelan oil industry 
exchange controls have now been enacted and many venezuela businesses have ceased or reduced operations causing substantial layoffs 
as a result of these adverse developments  the company recognized a million impairment charge related to its venezuela based assets in the fourth quarter of see note to the company s consolidated financial statements for a further discussion of the impairment of the company s assets in venezuela 
in december  the company decided to sell the two oldest  least capable rigs in its south america caribbean barge rig fleet and removed those rigs from service 
the carrying value of the two rigs was reduced to estimated net realizable value and the company recognized a million impairment charge for the year ended december  general and administrative general and administrative expense in increased by million  or  as compared to the increase is primarily attributable to higher personnel costs  including additional personnel attributable to the chiles acquisition  and costs associated with relocating the company s corporate headquarters

off balance sheet arrangements during the fourth quarter of  the company entered into an agreement with keppel fels limited kfels  a major international shipyard  and acquired a ownership interest in a harsh environment jackup rig under construction  which was subsequently named the ensco during the second quarter of  the company and kfels established a joint venture company  ensco enterprises limited eel  to own and charter the ensco upon completion of rig construction in may  the company and kfels transferred their respective interests in the ensco to eel in exchange for promissory notes in the amount of million and million  respectively 
the company has an option to purchase the ensco from eel  at a formula derived price  which expires in may the company and kfels have initial ownership interests in eel of and  respectively 
concurrent with the transfer of the rig to eel  the company agreed to charter the ensco from eel for a two year period that expires in may under the terms of the charter  the majority of the net cash flow generated by the ensco operations is remitted to eel in the form of charter payments 
however  the charter obligation is determined on a cumulative basis such that cash flow deficits incurred prior to initial rig operations are satisfied prior to the commencement of charter payments 
charter proceeds received by eel are used to pay interest on the promissory notes and any cash remaining after all accrued interest has been paid is used to repay the outstanding principal of the kfels promissory note 
pursuant to an agreement between the company and kfels  the respective ownership interests of the company and kfels in eel are adjusted concurrently with repayments of principal on the kfels promissory note such that each party s ownership interest is equal to the ratio of its outstanding promissory note balance to the aggregate outstanding principal balance of both promissory notes

the company has historically funded the majority of its liquidity from operating cash flow 
while future operating cash flow cannot be accurately predicted  management believes its long term liquidity will continue to be funded primarily by operating cash flow 
market risk the company uses various methods to manage its exposure to foreign currency exchange risk 
the company predominantly structures its drilling rig contracts in us dollars  which significantly reduces the portion of the company s cash flows and assets denominated in foreign currencies 
the company also employs various strategies  including the use of derivative instruments  to match foreign currency denominated assets with equal or near equal amounts of foreign currency denominated liabilities  thereby minimizing exposure to earnings fluctuations caused by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
the company occasionally utilizes derivative instruments to hedge forecasted foreign currency denominated transactions 
at december   the company had foreign currency exchange contracts outstanding to exchange million us dollars for australian dollars 
the fair value of the company s outstanding foreign currency exchange contracts at december   a net unrealized loss of  is included in accrued liabilities 
the company uses various derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to interest rate risk 
the company occasionally uses interest rate swap agreements to effectively convert the variable interest rate on debt to a fixed rate  and interest rate lock agreements to hedge against increases in interest rates on pending financing 
at december   the company had no outstanding interest rate swap agreements 
in connection with the acquisition of chiles on august   the company obtained million notional amount of outstanding treasury rate lock agreements 
chiles entered into the treasury rate lock agreements during the first and second quarters of and they mature in october upon acquisition  the company designated approximately million notional amount of the treasury rate lock agreements as an effective hedge against the variability in cash flows of million of marad guaranteed bonds the company intends to issue in october the bonds will provide long term financing for the recently constructed ensco the company deemed the remaining million notional amount of treasury rate lock agreements obtained in the chiles acquisition to be speculative in nature 
in october  the company settled million of the million notional amount of treasury rate lock agreements deemed as speculative 
the fair value of the treasury rate lock agreements at december   which is included in accrued current liabilities  has declined million from the august  chiles acquisition date  and a cumulative million since their inception 
the company recognized an  loss during in connection with the treasury rate lock agreements  which resulted from the decrease in fair value of treasury rate lock agreements deemed to be speculative 
the company utilizes derivative instruments and undertakes hedging activities in accordance with its established policies for the management of market risk 
the company does not enter into derivative instruments for trading or other speculative purposes 
it is the company s intention to settle the remaining million notional amount of speculative treasury rate lock agreements obtained in connection with the chiles acquisition prior their maturity 
management believes that the company s use of derivative instruments and related hedging activities do not expose the company to any material interest rate risk  foreign currency exchange rate risk  commodity price risk  credit risk or any other market rate or price risk 
outlook and forward looking statements changes in industry conditions and the corresponding impact on the company s operations cannot be accurately predicted because of the short term nature of many of the company s contracts and the volatility of oil and natural gas prices  which impact expenditures for oil and gas drilling 
whether recent levels of regional and worldwide expenditures for oil and gas drilling will increase  decrease or remain unchanged  is not determinable at this time 
the company s domestic offshore drilling operations are conducted in the gulf of mexico 
the us natural gas market and trends in oil company spending largely determine domestic offshore drilling industry conditions 
u 
s natural gas prices increased significantly during  and demand  and ultimately day rates  for offshore drilling rigs increased as many oil companies accelerated drilling programs in response to historically high natural gas prices 
jackup rigs mobilized to the gulf of mexico from international markets to take advantage of this strong demand 
during  natural gas prices decreased from record levels  and oil company gulf of mexico drilling budgets were sharply reduced over the course of the year and remained at moderate levels during today  demand for jackup drilling rigs in the gulf of mexico is significantly lower than that realized in early although some jackup rigs have now departed the gulf of mexico for international service  the supply of jackup rigs is still in excess of current demand 
as a result of this imbalance  day rates are significantly lower today than they were in and early the company does not expect any significant improvement in domestic day rates during the first half of industry conditions in most international offshore drilling markets have improved over the last two years  as many of the major international and government owned oil companies have increased spending in those markets 
cutbacks in opec production and an improved outlook for oil demand contributed to higher oil prices in and  and a more favorable climate for oil company spending 
although oil prices declined somewhat over the course of  increased drilling activity related to major natural gas development projects in asia pacific and the middle east contributed to increased demand for jackup drilling rigs in those regions 
demand and day rates for international jackup rigs strengthened during and and much of  particularly in europe and asia pacific 
however  in the second half of  day rates began to decrease modestly in europe 
day rates for jackup rigs in europe have stabilized to date in at the levels in effect at the end of  but current activity levels could lead to some near term softening of day rates in europe 
today  concerns related to global economic activity and the impact on oil demand growth have contributed to more modest increases in oil company spending 
uncertainty with regard to the middle east and the political unrest in venezuela have also contributed to cautiousness among oil companies  and this may impact spending plans over the course of although the outlook is uncertain  at this time the company expects day rates and utilization for international jackup rigs to remain relatively stable throughout the company continues its upgrade program on several of its north america jackup rigs  particularly in light of the current gulf of mexico market weakness 
the company moved three of its north america jackup rigs to pursue international opportunities  the ensco in december  to doha  qatar for a long term contract and the ensco and ensco in the first quarter of the ensco is operating in brunei and the ensco is currently operating under a contract in india 
the chiles merger in august increased the company s gulf of mexico jackup rig count to with three of the five rigs acquired in the chiles merger located in the gulf of mexico 
currently  of the company s north america jackup rigs are working 
the three idle rigs are undergoing shipyard modifications and upgrades and regulatory work 
the ensco is completing shipyard work and will commence operating under a contract in march the ensco and ensco entered a shipyard in early february and are scheduled to return to service in august and june  respectively 
currently  six of the company s seven jackup rigs in the europe region are working  with the one idle rig in a shipyard undergoing enhancements to the crew quarters and regulatory work in preparation for operations in the netherlands commencing in may in august  the company mobilized the ensco jackup rig from the north sea to nigeria where it commenced drilling operations in september the company s asia pacific rig fleet has increased to jackup rigs  with the addition of the three jackup rigs mobilized from the gulf of mexico  the completion of the ensco in may and the addition of the ensco as a result of the chiles merger on august  currently of the company s asia pacific unit rigs are operating  with one rig  the ensco  in a shipyard 
the ensco completed its contract in thailand in january and was mobilized to a shipyard in singapore for enhancements and regulatory work  with shipyard work completion projected mid year currently the ensco is uncommitted 
the company s south america caribbean jackup rig  the ensco  is operating under a long term contract offshore trinidad and tobago 
the ensco  the company s deep water semisubmersible rig that began gulf of mexico operations in december  is committed under contract until march currently  five of the company s six barge rigs located in venezuela are without contract  with one barge rig  the ensco ii  contracted through may during the fourth quarter of the economic and political environment in venezuela deteriorated severely 
a strike originating within pdvsa spread nationwide  involving the entire oil industry and the banking system  and causing substantial economic upheaval 
the strike  mass terminations of pdvsa employees and political interference in the management of pdvsa resulted in the near shutdown of the venezuelan oil industry 
exchange controls have now been enacted and many venezuela businesses have ceased or reduced operations  causing substantial layoffs 
further substantial contraction of the venezuela economy is possible 
the company believes the timing of an expected recovery of drilling activity in venezuela is uncertain and unlikely in the near term 
the company mobilized one of its large barge rigs from venezuela in the third quarter of the rig is now operating under a long term contract in indonesia after completing shipyard enhancements and modifications in singapore 
currently  two of the company s five platform rigs are operating under short term contracts 
the company s platform rigs have experienced utilization in the to range since the company s platform rigs are all capable of completing deep well programs as the rigs are rated for  to  feet wells 
the rigs are best suited for long term  deep well drilling applications where the platform rig components will stay in place for a substantial period of time 
the company s platform rigs compete against smaller  easier to mobilize and assemble  self erecting platform rigs for shallow well drilling 
the company is not able to predict when there will be a recovery of drilling activity that will require increased use of the class of platform rigs owned and operated by the company 
the company s marine transportation segment experienced decreased fleet utilization and day rates in the company expects the marine transportation market to remain soft in the near term as a result of the recent slow down in gulf of mexico drilling activity 
the company has entered into an agreement to sell all of its marine transportation vessels and expects to cease conducting marine transportation operations upon close of the transaction  which is subject to certain regulatory approvals  in the second quarter of this report contains forward looking statements by management and the company that are subject to a number of risks and uncertainties

critical accounting policies the company s significant accounting policies are included in note to the consolidated financial statements 
these policies  along with the underlying assumptions and judgements made by the company s management in their application  have a significant impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
the company identifies its most critical accounting policies as those that are the most pervasive and important to the portrayal of the company s financial position and results of operations  and that require the most difficult  subjective and or complex judgements by management regarding estimates about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the company s most critical accounting policies are those related to property and equipment  impairment of assets and income taxes 
property and equipment at december   the carrying value of the company s property and equipment totaled  million  which represents of total assets 
this carrying value reflects the application of the company s property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate estimates  assumptions and judgements by management relative to the capitalized costs  useful lives and salvage values of the company s rigs and vessels 
the company develops and applies property and equipment accounting policies that are designed to appropriately and consistently capitalize those costs incurred to enhance  improve and extend the useful lives of its assets and expense those costs incurred to repair or maintain the existing condition or useful lives of its assets 
the development and application of such policies requires judgement and assumptions by management relative to the nature of  and benefits from  expenditures on company assets 
the company establishes property and equipment accounting policies that are designed to depreciate or amortize its assets over their estimated useful lives 
the assumptions and judgements used by management in determining the estimated useful lives of its property and equipment reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future operations  utilization and performance of its assets 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgements in the establishment of property and equipment accounting policies  especially those involving the useful lives of the company s rigs and vessels  would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 
impairment of assets the company evaluates the carrying value of its property and equipment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of such assets may be impaired 
the company tests its million of goodwill for impairment on an annual basis  or when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of the company s drilling segment likely exceeds its fair value 
generally  extended periods of idle time and or inability to contract assets at economical rates are an indication that an asset may be impaired 
however  the offshore drilling and marine transportation industries are highly cyclical and it is not unusual for assets to be unutilized or underutilized for significant periods of time and subsequently resume full or near full utilization when business cycles change 
likewise  during periods of supply and demand imbalance  assets are frequently contracted at or near cash break even rates for extended periods of time until demand comes back into balance with supply 
impairment situations may arise with respect to specific individual assets  groups of assets  such as a type of drilling rig or class of marine vessel  or assets in a certain geographic location 
the company s assets are mobile and may be moved from markets with excess supply  if economically feasible 
the company s jackup rigs  semisubmersible rig and marine transportation vessels are suited for  and accessible to  broad and numerous markets throughout the world 
however  there are fewer economically feasible markets available to the company s barge rigs and platform rigs 
asset impairment evaluations are  by nature  highly subjective 
they involve expectations of future cash flows to be generated by the company s assets  and are based on management s assumptions and judgements regarding future industry conditions and operations  as well as management s estimates of future expected utilization  contract rates  expense levels and capital requirements of the company s drilling rigs and marine vessels 
the estimates  assumptions and judgements used by management in the application of the company s asset impairment policies reflect both historical experience and an assessment of current operational  industry  economic and political environments 
the use of different estimates  assumptions  judgements and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations  would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 
income taxes the company conducts operations and earns income in numerous foreign countries and is subject to the laws of taxing jurisdictions within those countries  as well as us federal and state tax laws 
at december   the company has a million net deferred income tax liability and million of accrued liabilities for income taxes currently payable 
the carrying values of deferred income tax assets and liabilities reflect the application of the company s income tax accounting policies in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas  and are based on management s assumptions and estimates regarding future operating results and levels of taxable income  as well as management s judgements regarding the interpretation of the provisions of sfas the carrying values of liabilities for income taxes currently payable are based on management s interpretation of applicable tax laws  and incorporate management s assumptions and judgements regarding the use of tax planning strategies in various taxing jurisdictions 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgements in connection with accounting for income taxes  especially those involving the deployment of tax planning strategies  may result in materially different carrying values of income tax assets and liabilities and results of operations
