our objective is to continue to capitalize on our design expertise and customer service capabilities to enhance product quality and reduce time to market for oem customers 
we have grown  and intend to continue to do so  through a combination of internal growth and acquisitions 
we completed eleven acquisitions between and june  that broadened our product offerings and customer base 
we achieve internal growth by expanding our existing product lines through new product development  through increasing penetration of our existing customer base  and by adding new customers 
sales for the year ended june  were million  which represents a decrease from the million of sales for fiscal net loss for the year ended june  was million  or net loss per common share assuming dilution of 
included in the determination of net loss in fiscal year is a transitional goodwill impairment charge of million or per common share  net of tax  which is reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  as a result of our adoption of sfas effective on july  we completed step of our transitional impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal year and determined that the carrying values of goodwill in the communications and enterprise reporting unit and the commercial reporting unit were in excess of their implied fair value as of july  additionally  on june   we announced plans to consolidate the communications and enterprise group operations  which resulted in the closure of the company s carlsbad  california facility in august as a result  we recorded employee severance and other consolidation costs of million during the fourth quarter of fiscal year including these charges  the total employee severance and consolidation costs for fiscal year were million  which incorporates the cost reduction efforts implemented by management in fiscal year see our discussion below in the section titled  results of operations 
the net loss in fiscal year compares to a net loss for the year ended june  of million  or net loss per common share assuming dilution of 
our performance during fiscal was affected by external factors  including dramatic changes in the markets we serve  and internal factors  including changes in senior management and overall corporate strategy 
the net loss for fiscal included million of inventory write downs  million of goodwill and identifiable intangible impairment charges  and million of employee severance and consolidation costs 
on june   sbs completed the acquisition of avvida systems inc  based in waterloo  ontario  canada 
avvida specializes in the development of image processing solutions focused on programmable logic  specifically  fully programmable gateway array fpga technology used on high performance video  image and data processing solutions 
see our discussion below in the section titled  recent acquisitions 

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements and related disclosures in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we use estimates when we account for items such as inventory  allowances for uncollectible accounts  depreciation and amortization periods  goodwill and intangible assets  and income taxes see note to the sbs consolidated financial statements 
these estimates and assumptions are based upon our continuous evaluation of historical results and anticipated future events 
actual results could differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the securities and exchange commission defines critical accounting polices as those that are  in management s view  most important to the portrayal of sbs financial condition and results of operations and those that require significant judgments and estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales generally upon shipment to customers provided we have received a valid purchase order  the price is fixed  title has transferred  collection of the associated receivable is reasonably assured  and there are no remaining significant obligations 
where customer acceptance provisions exist  we generally defer revenue recognition until acceptance by the customer unless we demonstrate the product meets the customer specified criteria upon shipment provided all other revenue recognition criteria were met 
inventory valuation 
we record inventory write downs based on estimates of obsolescence or unmarketable inventory  taking into account historical usage  forecasted future demand  and general market conditions 
write downs may also be recorded based on our decision to discontinue the marketing of certain products or product lines 
if our forecasts are incorrect  market conditions deteriorate  or we decide to exit other product lines  further inventory write downs may be required which result in an increase to cost of sales and reduced gross profit 
if market conditions or demand are better than expected  we may sell inventories that have been previously written down  resulting in reduced or zero cost of sales and improved gross profit 
allowance for uncollectible accounts 
we maintain allowances for uncollectible accounts receivable resulting from the failure of our customers to make required payments 
our estimate is based on  among other things  the aging of accounts receivable  historical write off experience  and the current and projected financial condition of our customers 
if we misinterpret the financial condition of our customers or if the financial condition of customers deteriorates  additional allowances for uncollectible accounts may be required  which would increase operating costs and reduce operating profit 
goodwill 
in conjunction with the implementation of sfas as of the beginning of fiscal year  goodwill is no longer amortized  but instead tested for impairment at least annually 
the first step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the fair value of a reporting unit to its carrying value 
the fair value of a reporting unit is the amount which the unit as a whole could be bought or sold in a current transaction between willing parties 
we conducted a transitional goodwill impairment test upon adoption of sfas as of july   and an annual goodwill impairment test as of april  the goodwill impairment test requires us to identify our reporting units and obtain estimates of the fair values of those units as of the testing date 
we estimate the fair values of our reporting units using discounted cash flow and public company market multiple valuation models 
those models require estimates of future revenues  profits  capital expenditures and working capital for each reporting unit 
we estimate these amounts by evaluating historical trends  current budgets  operating plans and industry data 
a decline in the fair value of any of our reporting units below its carrying value is an indicator that the underlying goodwill of the unit is potentially impaired 
if that occurs  we are required the complete the second step of the goodwill impairment test to determine whether the unit s goodwill is impaired 
the second step of the goodwill impairment test is a comparison of the implied fair value of a reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
an impairment loss is required for the amount which the carrying value of a reporting unit s goodwill exceeds its implied fair value 
if an impairment loss is recognized  the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill becomes the new cost basis of the unit s goodwill 
the estimated fair value in our transitional impairment analysis completed in december for two reporting units was less than each respective unit s carrying value indicating a potential for impairment at the test dates 
accordingly  we performed the required second step of the goodwill impairment test and compared the implied fair value of each 
table of contents reporting unit s goodwill to its carrying value 
the implied fair value of the goodwill in both reporting units tested in step  which was finalized during the quarter ended june   was less than the carrying value 
this resulted in a transitional impairment charge of approximately  net of tax  which is reflected as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in sbs consolidated financial statements 
the estimated fair value of goodwill in the annual test on april  was determined to be in excess of its carrying value  indicating the underlying goodwill was not impaired at that date 
we plan to conduct our annual impairment test as of april of each fiscal year  when our budgets and operating plans for the forthcoming year are finalized 
the timing and frequency of our goodwill impairment tests are based on an ongoing assessment of events and circumstances that would more than likely reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying value 
we will continue to monitor our goodwill balance for impairment and conduct formal tests when impairment indicators are present 
long lived and intangible assets 
we evaluate the carrying value of long lived and intangible assets whenever certain events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
these events or circumstances include  but are not limited to  a prolonged industry or economic downturn  a significant decline in sbs market value  or significant reductions in projected future cash flows 
an asset is considered to be impaired if future undiscounted cash flows  without consideration of interest  are insufficient to recover the carrying amount of the asset 
once an asset is deemed impaired  a charge to expense is recognized to the extent that the carrying amount of the asset exceeds fair value 
fair value is generally determined by calculating the discounted future cash flows using a discount rate based upon our weighted average cost of capital 
estimates of future cash flows require significant judgment  and any change in these estimates may result in additional impairment charges and reduced operating profits 
income taxes 
our estimate of current and deferred income taxes reflects our assessment of current and future taxes to be paid or received on items reflected in the financial statements  giving consideration to the recoverability of certain of the deferred tax assets  which arise from temporary differences between the tax and financial statement recognition of revenue and expense 
estimates of current income taxes include estimates for general business credits  benefits from us sales to foreign jurisdictions  and benefits from the utilization of foreign tax credits 
actual income taxes may vary from our estimates due to future changes in tax laws or because of a review of our tax returns by taxing authorities  which may result in an increase or decrease to income tax expense 
we must also assess the likelihood that we will be able to recover our deferred tax assets 
if recovery is determined not to be more likely than not  we must increase our provision for taxes by recording a reserve  in the form of a valuation allowance  for the deferred tax assets that we estimate will not ultimately be recoverable 
as of june   we believe that all of our recorded deferred tax assets will ultimately be recovered 
however  should there be a change in our ability to recover the deferred tax assets  our tax provision would increase in the period we determine that recovery is no longer more likely than not 
recent acquisitions sbs completed the acquisitions described below during the fiscal years ended june  and the acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method of accounting  and the results of operations of the acquired companies have been combined with sbs since the respective dates of acquisition 
the purchase price has been allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values with goodwill  if any  representing the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets acquired 
on june   sbs acquired percent of the outstanding common stock of avvida holdings corp 
and its wholly owned subsidiary  avvida systems inc avvida  located in waterloo  canada 
avvida provides image processing solutions to customers serving a wide variety of applications 
avvida s focus is emerging programmable logic  including fully programmable gateway array fpga technology utilized in high performance video  image and data processing solutions 
we plan to incorporate fpga technology into existing and future products across all sbs product lines 
the aggregate purchase price of million  including acquisition costs of million  was paid in cash and shares of sbs common stock valued at  the value of the  shares of sbs common stock was determined based on the average market price of sbs common shares over the two day period before and after the terms of the acquisition were agreed to and announced 
the purchase price was allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
in conjunction with the purchase price allocation  the estimated fair value of identifiable intangible assets  specifically a core technology asset valued at  and a covenant not to compete valued at million  was based on an assessment of their fair value determined by management  and goodwill of approximately million was recorded which is not deductible for tax purposes 
the identifiable intangible assets will be amortized over a period of 
table of contents years based on the estimated economic useful life of the core technology asset and the contractual period of the covenant 
the following unaudited pro forma consolidated results of operations for the fiscal year ended june  have been prepared as if the acquisition of avvida had occurred on july  accordingly  the weighted average shares used in the pro forma per share data were increased to reflect the shares issued in the acquisition

sbs utilizes essential s infiniband product expertise and industry relationships to build on its current infiniband efforts in the enterprise server and storage markets 
the purchase price has been allocated to the underlying assets acquired and liabilities assumed based on their estimated fair values 
in conjunction with the purchase price allocation  sbs recorded approximately  of identifiable intangibles  principally core technology assets  which are being amortized over a two year period

for the year ended june   sales decreased  or million  from million for the year ended june   to million 
sales for the communications and enterprise group were down  or million  from million in fiscal  to million as we continue to experience the effects of economic and market conditions negatively impacting our telecommunications infrastructure customers 
sales for the commercial and government group increased  or million  to million for the year ended june   from sales for the comparable period in fiscal of million 
one of our greatest challenges is a market that is still not demonstrating growth 
we have seen some signs of economic recovery in our lead generation and quoting activity  but the timing and scale of the effects on our business of these early indicators are  at this point  unpredictable 
we believe that both the commercial and communications markets bottomed during fiscal year both markets remain very competitive  but we will continue to invest in our business development team and in focused r d so that we can increase our market share 
in the government market  we believe that opportunities for new systems and applications will continue 
we believe that our product portfolio is competitive  and that sbs will benefit from those opportunities 
we are aggressive in our development activities  and we believe that there will be growth in this market  which should contribute to total company sales growth in fiscal year however  should the us defense budget be reviewed in light of the growth in the federal budget deficit or for other reasons  us procurement spending may be affected 
gross profit 
for the year ended june   gross profit increased  or million  from million for the year ended june   to million 
the increase in gross profit was primarily due to significant inventory write downs and other charges recorded in fiscal in fiscal  we recorded million of inventory write downs and  of expenditures associated with our manufacturing consolidation and cost reduction efforts 
the write downs 
table of contents consisted of inventory associated with programs that were not anticipated to come back to their previous forecasts  inventory associated with our decision to exit the legacy pci chassis product line  inventory associated with products that we will no longer market  and reduced demand for certain communications and enterprise group products 
additionally  the implementation of a new inventory management methodology associated with the consolidation of our manufacturing operations  contributed to the inventory write down in fiscal the consolidation efforts and new inventory methodology resulted in a reduction in required inventory levels 
for these reasons  gross profit as a percent of sales for fiscal improved to compared with for fiscal excluding the million of charges noted above 
during the year ended june   we sold approximately million of inventory that had been previously written down to zero cost  increasing gross margin as a percentage of sales by 
based on management s sales projections for fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of sales is expected to be similar to the percentage experienced in the year ended june   however  actual results may vary 
selling  general and administrative expense 
for the year ended june   selling  general and administrative sg a expense decreased  or million from million for the year ended june   to million 
this decrease was primarily due to the benefits realized from the implementation of cost reduction efforts which began during fiscal and continued in fiscal sg a expense as a percentage of sales decreased to in the year ended june  from in the year ended june   primarily as a result of the cost reduction efforts  partially offset by reduced sales levels 
research and development expense 
for the year ended june   research and development r d expense decreased  or  from million for the year ended june   to million 
this decrease was primarily due to the cost reduction efforts implemented in both fiscal and fiscal  partially offset by the addition of research and development employees resulting from the acquisition of the assets of essential communications completed in march for the year ended june   r d expense as a percentage of sales remained consistent at compared with in the year ended june  employee severance and consolidation costs 
for the year ended june   we recorded employee severance and consolidation costs of million  which include the following a charge for the impairment of leasehold improvements of approximately  recorded in the fourth quarter  on june   we announced that we would be closing our carlsbad  california facility and consolidating its manufacturing operations into our st 
paul  minnesota facility  centralizing all manufacturing in the united states to one facility 
this consolidation was completed in august  in addition  the results for the quarter ending september   will include charges associated with the closure of the carlsbad  california facility  which we estimate will range from million to million 
employee severance and related costs of approximately  and due to the economic and market conditions facing our communications and enterprise group  on july   we notified full and part time employees at our madison  wisconsin engineering design center that their jobs had been eliminated 
additionally  for the same reason  on september   we notified employees of the communications and enterprise group that their jobs were being eliminated 
we also incurred severance costs for other employees who were notified that their jobs had been eliminated 
as a result of these actions  we incurred  of employee severance costs  of which there were no costs remaining to be paid as of june  as a result of the june announcement of the closure of our carlsbad  california facility  we recorded severance and related costs of approximately  due primarily to the planned reduction of the workforce in august of this amount  approximately  was accrued at june  and we expect to pay substantially all of these costs during the quarter ending september  the results for the quarter ending september  will include the remainder of the severance and related costs associated with the closure of the carlsbad  california facility  which we estimate will be approximately  lease termination costs of approximately  as a result of our decision to exit certain locations 
these costs compare with total employee severance and related costs of approximately million incurred during fiscal  as a result of other actions taken by management in response to unfavorable economic and market conditions 

table of contents impairment of intangible assets 
we recorded no intangible asset impairment charges in fiscal  compared to impairment charges of million recorded in fiscal for the year ended june   million of the million asset impairment charge represented the write off of the remaining goodwill recorded in connection with the acquisition of sbs technologies  inc  industrial computers formerly micro alliance in november this write off was the result of sbs decision in the quarter ended december  to exit the pci chassis business 
the remaining million represented the write down of goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets associated with the acquisition of sdl in april of the write down  which occurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal  was based on sbs projection of undiscounted future operating cash flows 
this evaluation indicated that these cash flows were not sufficient to recover the carrying amounts of the goodwill and other identifiable intangible assets 
as a result  the impairment charge was recorded to the extent that the carrying value exceeded fair value of the assets 
the evaluation was performed as a result of continued order cancellations and a continued decline in sales and bookings in the fourth quarter of fiscal amortization of goodwill 
there was no goodwill amortization expense in fiscal  whereas goodwill amortization amounted to approximately million for the year ended june  effective july   we adopted sfas and no longer amortize goodwill 
as of the date of adoption  we had unamortized goodwill of approximately million  subject to the transition provisions of sfas included in the determination of net loss in fiscal is a transitional goodwill impairment charge of million million net of income taxes  which is reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  as a result of the company s adoption of sfas we completed step of our transitional impairment analysis during the quarter ended december  and noted an indication of potential impairment for two reporting units 
accordingly  we completed step of the required transitional impairment analysis during the fourth quarter of fiscal and determined that the carrying values of goodwill of the communications and enterprise reporting unit and the commercial reporting unit component of the commercial and government group segment were in excess of their implied fair value as of july  we completed our annual goodwill impairment test for fiscal as of april  and found no indication of impairment 
amortization of intangible assets 
for the year ended june   amortization of intangible assets was million  compared to million for the same period of fiscal the decrease was primarily due to the intangible asset impairment charges recorded during fiscal discussed previously 
interest and other income  net 
for the year ended june   net interest and other income of  consisted primarily of interest income associated with surplus cash 
for the year ended june   net interest and other income of  consisted primarily of a recovery from insurance of  and interest income associated with surplus cash  partially offset by a  charge related to an other than temporary decline in our investment in a software company 
foreign exchange losses 
for the year ended june   net foreign exchange losses of  were principally attributable to changes in exchange rates relating to payments made by sbs to a foreign subsidiary for marketing and other corporate costs borne by the foreign subsidiary 
for fiscal  net foreign exchange losses were not significant 
income tax expense benefit 
for the years ended june  and  income tax expense benefit from continuing operations excluding taxes allocated to the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle of million represented effective rates of and  respectively 
the change in the effective income tax rate was due to the impact of a shift in the mix of pre tax income from domestic and foreign sources coupled with benefits realized from tax planning strategies in excess of previous estimates 
we recorded a tax benefit related to the net loss in fiscal due to our ability to realize the benefit through a tax loss carry back to prior periods 
earnings per share 
for the year ended june   income per common share and income per common share assuming dilution  before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  was compared to a loss per common share and a loss per common share assuming dilution  before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  of for the same period in fiscal the per share impact of the transitional impairment charge as a result of the company s adoption of sfas  reported as a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle in fiscal  was a loss per common share and a loss per common share assuming dilution of 
for the year ended june   net loss per common share and net loss per common share assuming dilution were compared to for the same period in fiscal 
table of contents review of business segments we operate internationally through two operating segments the communications and enterprise group  and the commercial and government group 
the commercial and government group consists of sbs government  sbs commercial  kg  ortec and sbs canada  aligning similar technologies and selling channels 
the communications and enterprise group consists of sbs communications 
these segments are based on the markets we serve and the products we provide to those markets 
each segment has its own sales and distribution channels and a manager who reports directly to the president and chief operating officer 
the commercial and government group s primary focus is to serve customers in the medical  semiconductor  aerospace  defense and other commercial markets 
the communications and enterprise group serves major telecommunications oem s and oem s that manufacture and distribute business computing equipment 
the following is a discussion of sales to external customers and segment profit loss for each reportable segment 
in the measure of segment profit loss segment profit loss  we do not allocate the following to these segments substantially all amortization expense associated with acquisitions  intangible asset impairment charges  substantially all interest income earned on cash balances  and corporate overhead costs  excluding corporate marketing costs 
communications and enterprise group sales to external segment customers loss fiscal million million fiscal million million for the year ended june   communications and enterprise group sales to external customers decreased  or million compared to the same period of fiscal this decrease was due principally to the economic and market conditions negatively affecting this group 
we continue to experience the effects of reduced booking activities compared to prior periods  and delays of existing backlog orders and prior order cancellations by our telecommunications infrastructure customers 
for the year ended june   the reduction in the group s segment loss was primarily due to significant inventory write downs recorded in fiscal  coupled with lower sales and gross profit  offset partially by reduced r d expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal total inventory write downs of million recorded in fiscal were associated with programs that were not anticipated to come back to their previous forecasts and with our decision to exit our legacy pci chassis product line 
in fiscal  we recorded employee severance and consolidation costs due to the cost reduction efforts implemented in response to the economic and market conditions negatively affecting the group and the announcement  on june   of the closure of our carlsbad  california facility and the consolidation of its manufacturing operations into our st 
paul  minnesota facility  which we completed in august  for these reasons  for the year ended june   segment loss as a percent of sales to external customers improved from for the year ended june  to 
the results for the quarter ending september  will include the balance of the costs associated with the closure of the carlsbad  california facility  estimated to be between million and million 
commercial and government group sales to external segment customers profit fiscal million million fiscal million million for the year ended june   commercial and government group sales to external customers increased  or approximately million compared to the same period of fiscal unit shipments in fiscal increased for the group s computer processor products  and decreased slightly from fiscal levels for general purpose input output products  computer connectivity and expansion products  and avionics and telemetry products 
we believe the uncertainty caused by the military activity in the middle east during the quarter ended march  adversely affected the placement of some customer orders 

table of contents for the year ended june   the increase in segment profit was primarily due to the increase in sales combined with a change in sales mix to products with higher gross margins and decreases in sg a expenses as a result of the cost reduction efforts implemented during fiscal and in addition  there were significant inventory write downs recorded in fiscal in fiscal  a million inventory write down and  of expenditures associated with our manufacturing consolidation and cost reduction efforts were recorded 
the inventory write down in fiscal consisted of inventory associated with products that will no longer be marketed and excess component parts based on the implementation of the new inventory management methodology associated with the consolidation of our manufacturing operations 
this was partially offset by increased r d expenses in fiscal compared with fiscal resulting from the essential communications asset acquisition in march for the same reasons  for the year ended june   segment profit as a percent of sales to external customers improved to in fiscal from for the same period of fiscal year ended june  compared to year ended june  references to fiscal and fiscal relate to the fiscal years ended on june sales 
in fiscal  sales decreased  or million  from million in fiscal  to million 
unit shipments declined within the communications and enterprise group  primarily due to depressed market and economic conditions  customer order cancellations  and delays of shipment dates by several of the group s telecommunications infrastructure customers 
unit shipments of the commercial and government group s avionics  telemetry and computer processor products increased 
unit shipments of the group s general purpose i o products and computer connectivity and expansion unit products declined  due to unfavorable economic and market conditions and delays of shipment dates by several customers 
gross profit 
in fiscal  gross profit decreased  or million  from million in fiscal  to million 
this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales combined with million of expenditures associated with sbs manufacturing consolidation and cost reduction efforts  a million inventory write down recorded during the second quarter of fiscal  and a million inventory write down recorded during the fourth quarter of fiscal the second quarter write down consisted of inventory associated with programs that are not anticipated to come back to their previous forecasts  inventory associated with sbs decision to exit our legacy pci chassis product line  and inventory associated with sbs products that will no longer be marketed 
additionally  the implementation of a new inventory management methodology associated with the consolidation of sbs manufacturing operations contributed to the inventory write down 
the consolidation efforts included a reduction in the number of material handling employees and inventory specialists  a reduction in the amount of floor space for the storage of inventory  and the adoption of a purchasing methodology based on projected component part demand to achieve manufacturing and material handling efficiencies 
this new methodology calculates the maximum level of inventory to be maintained by comparing historical usage over a fixed period of time to forecasted future demand 
the consolidation efforts and new inventory methodology resulted in a reduction in required inventory levels 
the fourth quarter write down was primarily due to reduced demand for certain communications and enterprise group products 
as of june   approximately million of inventory previously written down had been utilized 
excluding the million of charges noted above  for fiscal  gross profit as a percentage of sales would have been  compared to for fiscal selling  general and administrative expense 
in fiscal  selling  general and administrative expense increased  or million from million in fiscal  to million 
this increase was primarily due to an increase in sbs sales personnel associated with the realignment of our business  additional corporate personnel  increases in executive compensation  relocation expenses for recently hired employees  additional information technology department personnel  depreciation and consulting expenses associated with the implementation of sbs customer relationship management system  additional reserves for accounts receivable due to collection issues  and costs associated with the termination of sbs proposed acquisition of interactive circuit systems ics in the quarter ended december  this increase  combined with the decrease in sales  resulted in an increase in sg a expense as a percentage of sales to in fiscal from in fiscal research and development expense 
in fiscal  research and development expense decreased by  or million  from million in fiscal  to million  primarily due to cost reductions in the communications and enterprise group  resulting from depressed business conditions 
in fiscal  research and development expense as a percentage of sales increased to from in fiscal  primarily due to the decrease in sales volume 
in july  the communications and enterprise group s madison  wisconsin facility was closed  resulting in the termination of full time employees and part time employees 

table of contents employee severance and consolidation costs 
in fiscal  sbs recorded employee severance and related costs as follows on april   sbs announced the resignation of the chairman of the board and chief executive officer  grahame e 
rance 
during the quarter ended june   sbs recorded approximately million of severance and other costs related to the separation agreement between sbs and mr

unit shipments of the group s computer processor products increased  primarily due to the focus on high volume production business in the quarter ended september   and an increase in shipments to a customer in the quarter ended june   partially offset by weak demand in the quarters ended december  and march  unit shipments of the group s avionics and telemetry products increased  primarily due to the release of the conduction cooled pmc design  an increase in sales of the pmc board  and an increase in sales of integrated products 
commercial and government group segment profit decreased  or million  from million in fiscal to million 
this decrease was primarily due to the decrease in sales  million of expenditures associated with sbs manufacturing consolidation and cost reduction efforts  severance and other employee termination costs  a second quarter million inventory write down  and an increase in sg a expenses 
the inventory write down consisted of inventory associated with products that will no longer be marketed and with the implementation of a new inventory management methodology associated with the consolidation of manufacturing operations 
the increase in sg a expense was primarily due to an increase in sales and marketing costs due to sbs pro rata allocation of certain corporate sg a expenses among segments  based on sales 
for the same reasons  segment profit as a percentage of sales decreased from in fiscal to in fiscal 
table of contents liquidity and financial condition we use a combination of the sale of equity securities  internally generated funds and bank borrowings to finance our acquisitions  working capital requirements  capital expenditures and operations 
comparison of condensed consolidated statements of cash flows years ended june  thousands cash flow provided by used in operating activities financing activities investing activities net effects on cash from exchange rates cumulative effect of change in accounting principle cash totaled million at june   an increase of million from june  net cash provided by operating activities was million and proceeds from the exercise of stock options totaled  operating cash inflows during fiscal include income tax refunds of approximately million as a result of the net operating loss carryback of the tax loss generated in fiscal to prior tax years 
these cash inflows were offset by million used for the acquisition of avvida   used for the purchase of license agreements  million used for the purchase of capital equipment   used to pay off notes payable assumed in the acquisition of avvida  and  used to repurchase  shares of sbs common stock pursuant to a repurchase plan initially adopted for a one year period by the board of directors on september  and extended until september  that plan allowed for the repurchase of up to  shares of sbs common stock at an aggregate cost not to exceed  during the year ended june   the increase in accounts receivable used operating cash of  prior to foreign currency translation adjustments of  and the decrease in inventory provided cash for operations of million  prior to foreign currency translation adjustments of  due to continued efforts to reduce inventory quantities 
liabilities  which increased by million in fiscal principally due to liabilities assumed in the acquisition of sbs canada  remain consistent with our current level of business 
on september   the company canceled its amended million credit agreement agreement with bank of america  na at no time during fiscal year were any borrowings drawn on the agreement 
management does not believe  as of the date of this report and based upon management s assessment of future cash needs and sources of cash  that our liquidity needs require us to maintain a credit facility at this time 
management believes that our internally generated funds will be sufficient to finance sbs current operations and capital expenditures  excluding acquisitions  for at least the next twelve months 
because long term cash flow cannot be predicted with certainty  it is possible that sbs could require external financing in the future  and that such financing may not be available on terms acceptable to sbs or at all 
as of the date of this report  sbs does not have any material capital expenditure commitments 
as of june   sbs is committed to pay approximately  of severance and related costs to employees in connection with the closure of the company s carlsbad  california facility of which  is accrued 
substantially all of these amounts will be paid during the quarter ending september  see employee severance and consolidation costs above 

table of contents sbs is committed under non cancelable operating leases that expire at various dates through fiscal the following is a five year schedule of future minimum lease payments buildings equipment year ending lease payments lease payments total dollars in thousands june  june  june  june  june  for the periods ended june   and  there was no significant impact from inflation 
business outlook consistent with our press release dated august   one of our greatest challenges is a market that is still not demonstrating growth 
we have seen some signs of economic recovery in our lead generation and quoting activity  but the timing and scale of the effects on our business of these early indicators are  at this point  unpredictable 
we believe that both the commercial and communications markets bottomed during fiscal year both markets remain very competitive  but we will continue to invest in our business development team and in focused r d so that we can increase our market share 
in the government market  we believe that opportunities for new systems and applications will continue 
we believe that our product portfolio is competitive  and that sbs will benefit from those opportunities 
we are aggressive in our development activities  and we believe that there will be growth in this market  which should contribute to total company sales growth in fiscal year however  should the us defense budget be reviewed in light of the growth in the federal budget deficit or for other reasons  us procurement spending may be affected 
at this time  we expect sales for the quarter ending september  to be similar to the sales of million reported for the quarter ended june  in addition  the results for the quarter ending september   will include the balance of costs associated with the closure of the carlsbad  california facility  estimated to be between million and million 
for the longer term  we believe we have the right strategy and we reaffirm our commitment to growth and earnings improvement

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s liquid investment is cash invested in either money market accounts or in overnight repurchase agreements 
due to the nature of these investments  we believe that the market risk related to these investments is minimal 
as a result of the company s german and canadian operating and financing activities  we are exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
as of june   we have no plans to enter into foreign exchange forward contracts to reduce exposure to changes in foreign currency exchange rates
