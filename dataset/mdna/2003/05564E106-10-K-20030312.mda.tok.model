risk factors the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
risks due to investment in real estate decreased yields from an investment in real property due to factors that may cause a decrease in revenues or values or an increase in operating expenses real property investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
the yields available from equity investments in real estate depend upon the amount of revenues generated and expenses incurred 
if properties do not generate revenues sufficient to meet operating expenses  including debt service and capital expenditures  our results from operations and ability to make distributions to our shareholders will be adversely affected 
the performance of the economy in each of the areas in which the properties are located affects occupancy  market rental rates and expenses 
these factors consequently can have an impact on revenues from the properties and their underlying values 
the financial results and labor decisions of major local employers may also have an impact on the revenues from and value of certain properties 
other factors may further adversely affect revenues from and values of our properties 
these factors include the general economic climate  local conditions in the areas in which properties are located such as an oversupply of apartment units or a reduction in the demand for apartment units  the attractiveness of the properties to residents  competition from other multifamily communities and our ability to provide adequate facilities maintenance  services and amenities 
our revenues would also be adversely affected if residents were unable to pay rent or we were unable to rent apartments on favorable terms 
if we were unable to promptly relet or renew the leases for a significant number of apartment units  or if the rental rates upon such renewal or reletting were significantly lower than expected rates  then our funds from operations would  and our ability to make expected distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt may  be adversely affected 
there is also a risk that as leases on the properties expire  residents will vacate or enter into new leases on terms that are less favorable to us 
operating costs  including real estate taxes  insurance and maintenance costs  and mortgage payments  if any  do not  in general  decline when circumstances cause a reduction in income from a property 
we could sustain a loss as a result of foreclosure on the property  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we were unable to meet our mortgage payments 
in addition  applicable laws  including tax laws  interest rate levels and the availability of financing also affect revenues from properties and real estate values 
development and construction projects may not be completed or completed successfully as a general matter  property development and construction projects typically have a higher  and sometimes substantially higher  level of risk than the acquisition of existing properties 
we intend to actively pursue development and construction of multifamily apartment communities 
there can be no assurance that we will complete development of the properties currently under development or any other development project that we may undertake 
risks associated with our development and construction activities may include the following development opportunities may be abandoned  construction costs of multifamily apartment communities may exceed original estimates  possibly making the communities uneconomical  occupancy rates and rents at newly completed communities may not be sufficient to make the communities profitable  financing for the construction and development of projects may not be available on favorable terms or at all  construction and lease up may not be completed on schedule  and expenses of operating a completed community may be higher than anticipated 
in addition  development and construction activities  regardless of whether or not they are ultimately successful  typically require a substantial portion of management s time and attention 
development and construction activities are also subject to risks relating to the inability to obtain  or delays in obtaining  all necessary zoning  land use  building  occupancy  and other required governmental permits and authorizations 
investments in newly acquired properties may not perform in accordance with expectations in the normal course of business  we typically evaluate potential acquisitions  enter into non binding letters of intent  and may  at any time  enter into contracts to acquire and may acquire additional properties 
however  no assurance can be given that we will have the financial resources to make suitable acquisitions or that properties that satisfy our investment policies will be available for acquisition 
acquisitions of properties entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations 
estimates of the costs of improvements to bring an acquired property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property might prove inaccurate 
other risks may include rehabilitation costs exceeding original estimates  possibly making a project uneconomical  financing not being available on favorable terms or at all  and rehabilitation and lease up not being completed on schedule 
in addition  there are general real estate investment risks associated with any new real estate investment  including environmental risks 
although we undertake an evaluation of the physical condition of each new investment before it is acquired  certain defects or necessary repairs may not be detected until after the investment is acquired 
this could significantly increase our total acquisition costs  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 
illiquidity of real estate and reinvestment risk may reduce economic returns to investors real estate investments are relatively illiquid and  therefore  tend to limit our ability to adjust our portfolio in response to changes in economic or other conditions 
additionally  the internal revenue code places certain limits on the number of properties a reit may sell without adverse tax consequences 
to affect our current operating strategy  we have in the past raised  and will seek to continue to raise additional funds  both through outside financing and through the orderly disposition of assets that no longer meet our investment criteria 
depending upon interest rates  current development and acquisition opportunities and other factors  generally we will reinvest the proceeds in multifamily properties  although such funds may be employed in other uses 
in the markets we have targeted for future acquisition of multifamily properties  there is considerable buying competition from other real estate companies  many of whom may have greater resources  experience or expertise than we 
in many cases  this competition for acquisition properties has resulted in an increase in property prices and a decrease in property yields 
due to the relatively low capitalization rates currently prevailing in the pricing of potential acquisitions of multifamily properties which meet our investment criteria  no assurance can be given that the proceeds realized from the disposition of assets  which no longer meet our investment criteria  can be reinvested to produce economic returns comparable to those being realized from the properties disposed of  or that we will be able to acquire properties meeting our investment criteria 
to the extent that we are unable to reinvest proceeds from the assets that no longer meet our investment criteria  or if properties acquired with such proceeds produce a lower rate of return than the properties disposed of  such results may have a material adverse effect on us 
in addition  a delay in reinvestment of such proceeds may have a material adverse effect on us 
we may seek to structure future dispositions as tax free exchanges  where appropriate  utilizing the non recognition provisions of section of the internal revenue code to defer income taxation on the disposition of the exchanged property 
for an exchange of such properties to qualify for tax free treatment under section of the internal revenue code  certain technical requirements must be met 
given the competition for properties meeting our investment criteria  it may be difficult for us to identify suitable properties within the proscribed time frames in order to meet the requirements of section even if we can structure a suitable tax deferred exchange  as noted above  we cannot assure that we will reinvest the proceeds of any of these dispositions to produce economic returns comparable to those currently being realized from the properties which were disposed of 
substantial competition among multifamily properties and real estate companies may adversely affect our rental revenues and development and acquisition opportunities all of the properties currently owned by us are located in developed areas 
there are numerous other multifamily properties and real estate companies  many of which have greater financial and other resources than we have  within the market area of each of the properties which will compete with us for residents and development and acquisition opportunities 
the number of competitive multifamily properties and real estate companies in such areas could have a material effect on our ability to rent the apartments and the rents charged  and development and acquisition opportunities 
the activities of these competitors could cause us to pay a higher price for a new property than we otherwise would have paid or may prevent us from purchasing a desired property at all  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
potential effect on operations due to geographic concentration of properties and economic conditions  dependence on western united states regions our portfolio is located in the san francisco bay area  los angeles orange county  san diego  sacramento  seattle  portland  salt lake city  the denver area and phoenix 
our performance could be adversely affected by economic conditions in  and other factors relating to  these geographic areas  including supply and demand for apartments in these areas  zoning and other regulatory conditions and competition from other properties and alternative forms of housing 
in that regard  certain of these areas have in the recent past or are currently experiencing economic recessions and depressed conditions in the local real estate markets 
to the extent general economic or social conditions in any of these areas further deteriorate or any of these areas experiences natural disasters  the value of the portfolio  our results of operations and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt could be materially adversely affected 
inability to implement growth strategy  potential failure to identify  acquire or integrate new acquisitions our future growth will be dependent upon a number of factors  including our ability to identify acceptable properties for development and acquisition  complete acquisitions and developments on favorable terms  successfully integrate acquired and newly developed properties  and obtain financing to support expansion 
there can be no assurance that we will be successful in implementing our growth strategy  that growth will continue at historical levels or at all  or that any expansion will improve operating results 
the failure to identify  acquire and integrate new properties effectively could have a material adverse affect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
a substantial portion of our growth over the last several years has been attributable to acquisitions 
we intend to continue to acquire stabilized multifamily apartment communities to the extent we identify communities that meet our investment criteria 
acquisitions of multifamily apartment communities entail risks that investments will fail to perform in accordance with expectations 
estimates of the costs of improvements to bring an acquired property up to standards established for the market position intended for that property might prove inaccurate 
in addition  there are general investment risks associated with any new real estate investment 
uninsured and underinsured losses  limited insurance coverage we carry comprehensive liability  fire  extended coverage and rental loss insurance with respect to our properties with certain policy specifications  limits and deductibles 
while as of december   we carried flood and earthquake insurance for our properties with an aggregate annual limit of million  subject to substantial deductibles  no assurance can be given that such coverage will be available on acceptable terms or at an acceptable cost  or at all  in the future  or if obtained  that the limits of those policies will cover the full cost of repair or replacement of covered properties 
in addition  there may be certain extraordinary losses such as those resulting from civil unrest or terrorist acts that are not generally insured or fully insured against or underinsured losses such as those resulting from claims in connection with the occurrence of mold  asbestos  and lead because they are either uninsurable or not economically insurable 
should an uninsured or underinsured loss occur to a property  we could be required to use our own funds for restoration or lose all or part of our investment in  and anticipated revenues from  the property and would continue to be obligated on any mortgage indebtedness on the property 
any such loss could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 
survey exceptions to certain title insurance policies may result in incomplete coverage in the event of a claim we did not obtain updated surveys when we acquired properties from trammell crow residential west because we believe that prior owners of the trammell crow residential west properties in the past obtained surveys of these properties 
because updated surveys of the trammell crow residential west properties acquired were not obtained  the title insurance policies obtained by us for those fifteen properties contain exceptions for matters that an updated survey might have disclosed 
such matters might include such things as boundary encroachments  unrecorded easements or similar matters  which would have been reflected on a survey 
moreover  because no updated surveys were prepared for these properties  there can be no assurance that the title insurance policies in fact cover the entirety of the real property  buildings  fixtures  and improvements which we believe they cover  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us 
adverse changes in laws may affect our potential liability relating to the properties and our operations increases in real estate taxes and income  service and transfer taxes cannot always be passed through to residents or users in the form of higher rents  and may adversely affect our cash available for distribution and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
similarly  changes in laws increasing the potential liability for environmental conditions existing on properties or increasing the restrictions on discharges or other conditions  as well as changes in laws affecting development  construction and safety requirements  may result in significant unanticipated expenditures  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 
in addition  future enactment of rent control or rent stabilization laws or other laws regulating multifamily housing may reduce rental revenues or increase operating costs 
potential effect on costs and investment strategy from compliance with laws benefiting disabled persons a number of federal  state and local laws including the americans with disabilities act and regulations exist that may require modifications to existing buildings or restrict certain renovations by requiring improved access to such buildings by disabled persons and may require other structural features which add to the cost of buildings under construction 
legislation or regulations adopted in the future may impose further burdens or restrictions on us with respect to improved access by disabled persons 
the costs of compliance with these laws and regulations may be substantial  and limits or restrictions on construction or completion of certain renovations may limit implementation of our investment strategy in certain instances or reduce overall returns on our investments  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
we review our properties periodically to determine the level of compliance and  if necessary  take appropriate action to bring such properties into compliance 
we believe  based on property reviews to date  that the costs of such compliance should not have a material adverse effect on us 
such conclusions are based upon currently available information and data  and no assurance can be given that further review and analysis of our properties  or future legal interpretations or legislative changes  will not significantly increase the costs of compliance 
restrictions on the operations of the operating company fifteen of our properties are held by bre property investors llc  which is referred to in this annual report on form k as the operating company 
we are the sole managing member of the operating company and  as of december   held approximately an equity interest in it 
third parties as non managing members hold the remaining equity interests in the operating company 
under the terms of the limited liability company agreement governing the operations of the operating company  the operating company is required to maintain certain debt service coverage  debt to asset and other financial ratios intended to protect the members rights to receive distributions 
in addition  with respect to the outstanding debt for certain properties  the operating company is restricted from repaying its debt or taking certain other specified action that could have adverse tax consequences for the members 
further  we  as the managing member  are restricted from taking certain other specified actions either absolutely or without the consent of a majority in interest of the non managing members or of the non managing members affected thereby including  but not limited to  any actions that would make it impossible to carry out the business of the operating company that would subject a non managing member to liability as a managing member  or that would cause the operating company to institute bankruptcy proceedings or permit an automatic judgment to be entered against it by a creditor 
any such requirement to maintain financial ratios and any such restrictions on the actions of the operating company and its managing member could have a material adverse affect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
further  under the terms of the operating company s limited liability company agreement  the operating company must obtain the consent of a majority in interest of the non managing members in order to dispose of any of the properties held by the operating company properties with a gross book value of  in a taxable sale or exchange prior to respective dates which are specified in the operating company s limited liability company agreement for each of the properties  ranging from eight to years from november   or dissolve the operating company other than in certain limited circumstances specified in the operating company s limited liability company agreement  such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets  or any merger  consolidation or other combination by us with or into another person  or reclassification  recapitalization or change of our outstanding equity interests 
these restrictions on our ability to dispose of a portion of our properties and to dissolve the operating company  even when such a disposition or dissolution of the operating company would be in our best interest  could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
the operating company also must distribute all available cash as defined in the operating company s limited liability company agreement on a quarterly basis first  a priority distribution to members other than us until each member has received  cumulatively on a per operating company unit basis  distributions equal to the cumulative dividends declared with respect to one share of bre common stock over the corresponding period subject to adjustment from time to time as applicable to account for stock dividends  stock splits and similar transactions affecting bre common stock  and second  the balance to us 
if the operating company s available cash in any quarterly period is insufficient to permit distribution of the full amount of the priority distribution described above for that quarter  we are required to make a capital contribution to the operating company in an amount equal to the lesser of the amount necessary to permit the full priority distribution  or an amount equal to the sum of any capital expenditures made by the operating company plus the sum of any payments made by the operating company on account of any loans to or investments in  or any guarantees of the obligations of  bre or our affiliates for that quarterly period 
in addition  we may not be removed as the managing member of the operating company by the non managing members  with or without cause  other than with our consent 
we may not voluntarily withdraw from the operating company or transfer all or any portion of our interest in the operating company without the consent of all of the non managing members  except in certain limited circumstances  such as a sale of all or substantially all of our assets  or any merger  consolidation or other combination by us with or into another person  or any reclassification  recapitalization or change of our outstanding equity interests 
such restrictions on our withdrawal as the managing member of the operating company  and on our ability to transfer our interest in the operating company  could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
risks due to real estate financing we anticipate that future developments and acquisitions will be financed  in whole or in part  under various construction loans  lines of credit  and other forms of secured or unsecured financing or through the issuance of additional debt or equity by us 
we expect periodically to review our financing options regarding the appropriate mix of debt and equity financing 
equity  rather than debt  financing of future developments or acquisitions could have a dilutive effect on the interests of our existing shareholders 
similarly  there are certain risks involved with financing future developments and acquisitions with debt  including those described below 
in addition  if new developments are financed through construction loans  there is a risk that  upon completion of construction  permanent financing for such properties may not be available or may be available only on disadvantageous terms or that the cash flow from new properties will be insufficient to cover debt service 
if a newly developed or acquired property is unsuccessful  our losses may exceed our investment in the property 
any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
potential inability to renew  repay or refinance our debt financing we are subject to the normal risks associated with debt financing  including the risk that our cash flow will be insufficient to meet required payments of principal and interest  the risk that indebtedness on our properties  or unsecured indebtedness  will not be able to be renewed  repaid or refinanced when due or that the terms of any renewal or refinancing will not be as favorable as the existing terms of such indebtedness 
if we were unable to refinance our indebtedness on acceptable terms  or at all  we might be forced to dispose of one or more of the properties on disadvantageous terms  which might result in losses to us 
such losses could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and pay amounts due on our debt 
furthermore  if a property is mortgaged to secure payment of indebtedness and we are unable to meet mortgage payments  the mortgagee could foreclose upon the property  appoint a receiver and receive an assignment of rents and leases or pursue other remedies  all with a consequent loss of our revenues and asset value 
foreclosures could also create taxable income without accompanying cash proceeds  thereby hindering our ability to meet the reit distribution requirements of the internal revenue code 
increase in cost of indebtedness due to rising interest rates we have incurred and expect in the future to incur indebtedness that bears interest at a variable rate 
accordingly  increases in interest rates would increase our interest costs  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders or cause us to be in default under certain debt instruments 
in addition  an increase in market interest rates may lead holders of our common shares to demand a higher yield on their shares from distributions by us  which could adversely affect the market price for bre common stock 
potential incurrence of additional debt and related debt service we currently fund the acquisition and development of multifamily communities partially through borrowings including our line of credit as well as from other sources such as sales of properties which no longer meet our investment criteria or the contribution of property to joint ventures which may in turn secure debt 
our organizational documents do not contain any limitation on the amount of indebtedness that we may incur 
accordingly  subject to limitations on indebtedness set forth in various loan agreements  we could become more highly leveraged  resulting in an increase in debt service  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt and in an increased risk of default on our obligations 
restrictive terms of certain indebtedness may cause acceleration of debt payments at december   we had outstanding borrowings of approximately billion 
our indebtedness contains financial covenants as to minimum net worth  interest coverage ratios  maximum secured debt  and total debt to capital  among others 
in the event that an event of default occurs  our lenders may declare borrowings under the respective loan agreements to be due and payable immediately  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
potential liability under environmental laws under various federal  state and local laws  ordinances and regulations  a current or previous owner or operator of real estate may be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of certain hazardous or toxic substances in  on  around or under such property 
such laws often impose such liability without regard to whether the owner or operator knew of  or was responsible for  the presence of such hazardous or toxic substances 
the presence of  or failure to remediate properly  such substances may adversely affect the owner s or operator s ability to sell or rent the affected property or to borrow using such property as collateral 
persons who arrange for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances may also be liable for the costs of removal or remediation of such substances at a disposal or treatment facility  whether or not such facility is owned or operated by such person 
certain environmental laws impose liability for release of asbestos containing materials into the air  and third parties may also seek recovery from owners or operators of real properties for personal injury associated with asbestos containing materials and other hazardous or toxic substances 
federal and state laws also regulate the operation and subsequent removal of certain underground storage tanks 
in connection with the current or former ownership direct or indirect  operation  management  development and or control of real properties  we may be considered an owner or operator of such properties or as having arranged for the disposal or treatment of hazardous or toxic substances and  therefore  may be potentially liable for removal or remediation costs  as well as certain other costs  including governmental fines  and claims for injuries to persons and property 
our current policy is to obtain a phase i environmental study on each property we seek to acquire and to proceed accordingly 
no assurance can be given  however  that the phase i environmental studies or other environmental studies undertaken with respect to any of our current or future properties will reveal all or the full extent of potential environmental liabilities  that any prior owner or operator of a property did not create any material environmental condition unknown to us  that a material environmental condition does not otherwise exist as to any one or more of such properties or that environmental matters will not have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
we currently carry no insurance for environmental liabilities 
certain environmental laws impose liability on a previous owner of property to the extent that hazardous or toxic substances were present during the prior ownership period 
a transfer of the property does not relieve an owner of such liability 
thus  we may have liability with respect to properties previously sold by us or our predecessors 
recently there has been an increasing number of lawsuits against owners and managers of multifamily properties alleging personal injury and property damage caused by the presence of mold in residential real estate 
some of these lawsuits have resulted in substantial monetary judgments or settlements 
insurance carriers have reacted to these liability awards by excluding mold related claims from standard policies and pricing mold endorsements separately 
we have obtained a separate pollution insurance policy that covers mold related claims and have adopted programs designed to minimize the existence of mold in any of our properties as well as guidelines for promptly addressing and resolving reports of mold 
to the extent not covered by our pollution policy  the presence of significant mold could expose us to liability from residents and others if property damage  health concerns  or allegations thereof  arise 
ranking of securities and subordination of claims a portion of our operations is conducted through our subsidiaries  including the operating company 
our cash flow and the consequent ability to make distributions and other payments on our equity securities and to service our debt will be partially dependent upon the earnings of such subsidiaries and the distribution of those earnings to us  or upon loans or other payments of funds made by such subsidiaries to us 
in addition  debt or other arrangements of our subsidiaries may impose restrictions that affect  among other things  our subsidiaries ability to pay dividends or make other distributions or loans to us 
likewise  a portion of our consolidated assets is owned by our subsidiaries  effectively subordinating certain unsecured indebtedness of bre to all existing and future liabilities  including indebtedness  trade payables  lease obligations and guarantees of our subsidiaries 
the operating company has guaranteed amounts due under our million bank credit facility with a syndicate of banks 
likewise  any other of our subsidiaries with assets or net income which  when multiplied by our effective percentage ownership interest in such subsidiary exceeds million or of our consolidated net income  respectively  is required to guarantee the repayment of borrowings under the credit facility 
the operating company and other of our subsidiaries may also  from time to time  guarantee other of our indebtedness 
therefore  our rights and rights of our creditors  including the holders of other unsecured indebtedness  to participate in the assets of any subsidiary upon the latter s liquidation or reorganization will be subject to the prior claims of such subsidiary s creditors  except to the extent that we may ourselves be a creditor with recognized claims against the subsidiary  in which case our claims would still be effectively subordinate to any security interests in or mortgages or other liens on the assets of such subsidiary and would be subordinate to any indebtedness of such subsidiary senior to that held by us 
provisions that could limit a change in control or deter a takeover in order to maintain our qualification as a reit  not more than in value of our outstanding capital stock may be owned  actually or constructively  by five or fewer individuals as defined in the internal revenue code to include certain entities 
in order to protect us against risk of losing our status as a reit due to a concentration of ownership among our shareholders  our charter provides  among other things  that if the board of directors determines  in good faith  that direct or indirect ownership of bre common stock has or may become concentrated to an extent that would prevent us from qualifying as a reit  the board of directors may prevent the transfer of bre common stock or call for redemption by lot or other means affecting one or more shareholders selected in the sole discretion of the board of directors of a number of shares of bre common stock sufficient in the opinion of the board of directors to maintain or bring the direct or indirect ownership of bre common stock into conformity with the requirements for maintaining reit status 
these limitations may have the effect of precluding acquisition of control of us by a third party without consent of the board of directors 
in addition  certain other provisions contained in our charter and bylaws may have the effect of discouraging a third party from making an acquisition proposal for us and may thereby inhibit a change in control 
our articles of incorporation include provisions establishing a staggered board of directors  restrictions on unsolicited business combinations and restrictions on our shareholders ability to amend our articles of incorporation 
our bylaws contain restrictions on our shareholders ability to call special meetings of our board of directors  provisions allowing our board of directors to increase its size and restrictions on the transfer of shares of our capital stock with respect to the preservation of our reit status 
such provisions may deter tender offers for bre common stock which offers may be attractive to the shareholders  or deter purchases of large blocks of bre common stock  thereby limiting the opportunity for shareholders to receive a premium for their shares of bre common stock over then prevailing market prices 
tax risks tax liabilities as a consequence of failure to qualify as a reit although management believes that we are organized and are operating so as to qualify as a reit under the internal revenue code  no assurance can be given that we have in fact operated or will be able to continue to operate in a manner so as to qualify or remain so qualified 
qualification as a reit involves the application of highly technical and complex internal revenue code provisions for which there are only limited judicial or administrative interpretations and the determination of various factual matters and circumstances not entirely within our control 
for example  in order to qualify as a reit  at least of our taxable gross income in any year must be derived from qualifying sources and we must make distributions to shareholders aggregating annually at least of our reit taxable income excluding net capital gains 
thus  to the extent revenues from non qualifying sources such as income from third party management represents more than of our gross income in any taxable year  we will not satisfy the income test and may fail to qualify as a reit  unless certain relief provisions apply 
even if those relief provisions apply  a tax would be imposed with respect to excess net income  any of which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
additionally  to the extent the operating company or certain other subsidiaries are determined to be taxable as a corporation  we would not qualify as a reit  which could have a material adverse effect on us and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
if we fail to qualify as a reit  we will be subject to federal income tax including any applicable alternative minimum tax on our taxable income at corporate rates  which would likely have a material adverse effect on us  our share price and our ability to make distributions to our shareholders and to pay amounts due on our debt 
in addition  unless entitled to relief under certain statutory provisions  we would also be disqualified from treatment as a reit for the four taxable years following the year during which qualification was lost 
this treatment would reduce funds available for investment or distribution to our shareholders because of the additional tax liability to us for the year or years involved 
in addition  we would no longer be required to make distributions to our shareholders 
to the extent that distributions to our shareholders would have been made in anticipation of qualifying as a reit  we might be required to borrow funds or to liquidate certain investments to pay the applicable tax 
finally  no assurance can be given that new legislation  new regulations  administrative interpretations or court decisions will not change the tax laws with respect to qualification as a reit or the federal income tax consequences of such qualification

item legal proceedings bre is defending various claims and legal actions that arise in its normal course of business 
while it is not feasible to predict or determine the ultimate outcome of these matters  in the opinion of management  none of these actions will have a material adverse effect on us 
on june   bre entered into an agreement for formation of limited liability company and contribution of project with an unrelated third party 
the agreement contemplated that upon the completion of pinnacle at macarthur  bre would contribute the project to a joint venture in which bre and the third party would be members 
the closing deadline under the agreement was april  however  due to disagreements between bre and the third party regarding their respective rights and obligations under the agreement  the closing did not occur 
on april   the third party brought litigation against bre in the united states district court for the central district of california  santa ana division 
the lawsuit seeks specific performance of the agreement or  in the alternative  damages 
bre has filed a counterclaim for a declaration that it was not  in fact  obligated to enter into the transaction under the terms demanded by the third party 
resolution of this dispute is pending and the outcome is not yet determinable 
management does not anticipate that the litigation will have a material effect on bre s consolidated financial statements

item selected financial data the selected financial data below should be read in conjunction with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations and the consolidated financial statements and notes 
the results are affected by the transactions with g i iii residential one  llc dra advisors in and and numerous acquisitions and dispositions as discussed in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations

we consider funds from operations to be an appropriate supplemental measure of the performance of an equity reit because it is predicated on cash flow analyses that facilitate an understanding of the operating performances of our properties without giving effect to non cash items such as depreciation 
additionally  we analyze the relationship between dividend payments and ffo to measure our ability to pay dividends to our shareholders 
ffo is defined by the national association of real estate investment trusts as net income or loss computed in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states excluding gains or losses from debt restructuring and sales of property  plus depreciation and amortization of real estate assets 
ffo does not represent cash generated from operating activities in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  and therefore should not be considered a substitute for net income as a measure of results of operations or for cash flow from operations as a measure of liquidity 
additionally  the application and calculation of ffo by other reits may vary materially from our calculations  and therefore our ffo and the ffo of other reits may not be directly comparable 
on october   nareit revised its definition for periods after january  consequently  ffo calculations for periods ending subsequent to january  may not be comparable to calculations for periods ended prior to that date 
expenses related to velocityhsi were added back to operating results to determine ffo from real estate in prior years 
our investment in velocityhsi was recorded under the equity method of accounting 
the recognition of our portion of income or losses was recorded on a day lag basis  with losses applied to the extent of our investment in and receivables from velocityhsi 
the effect of including losses from this investment in ffo would be to decrease ffo by  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
there was no impact from velocityhsi in item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we are a self administered equity real estate investment trust or reit focused on the development  acquisition and management of multifamily apartment communities in nine metropolitan markets of the western united states 
at december   our portfolio had real estate assets with a net book value of approximately billion that included wholly or majority owned completed apartment communities  aggregating  units  two multifamily communities owned in joint ventures  comprised of apartment units  and seven apartment communities in various stages of construction and development  totaling  units 
critical accounting policies we define critical accounting policies as those that require management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments 
a summary of our critical accounting policies follows 
additional discussion of accounting policies that we consider significant  including further discussion of the critical accounting policies described below  can be found in the notes to our consolidated financial statements 
real estate on january   we adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets which requires that the assets and liabilities and the results of operations of any communities which have been sold during  or otherwise qualify as held for sale as of december   be presented as discontinued operations in our consolidated financial statements in both current and prior periods presented 
the community specific real estate classified as held for sale is stated at the lower of its carrying amount or estimated fair value less disposal costs 
depreciation is not recorded on assets classified as held for sale 
in accordance with sfas no 
 our investments in real estate are carried at cost and are periodically evaluated for indicators of impairment 
the evaluation of impairment and the determination of values are based on several factors  and future events could occur which would cause management to conclude that indicators of impairment exist and a reduction in carrying value to estimated fair value is warranted 
in the normal course of business  we will receive offers for sale of our properties  either solicited or unsolicited 
for those offers that are accepted  the prospective buyer will usually require a due diligence period before consummation of the transaction 
it is not unusual for matters to arise that result in the withdrawal or rejection of the offer during this process 
we classify real estate as held for sale when it is probable  in the opinion of management  that a property will be disposed of within one year 
capital expenditures we capitalize those expenditures related to conducting significant rehabilitation of existing assets and extending the useful life of existing assets 
these expenditures are depreciated over estimated useful lives determined by management 
we expense certain improvements related to the operation of apartment communities  including carpets  window coverings and appliance replacements  as well as those expenditures necessary to maintain an existing community in ordinary operating condition 
the determination as to whether expenditures should be capitalized or expensed  and the period over which depreciation is recognized  requires management s judgment 
internal cost capitalization we have a development group which manages the design  development and construction of our apartment communities 
all direct and indirect costs incurred to ready these assets for their intended use and which are specifically identifiable  including interest and real estate taxes during construction  are capitalized as a cost of the communities 
derivatives and hedging activities we use derivative financial instruments in the normal course of business with the objective of lowering our overall borrowing costs 
as of december   we had five interest rate swap agreements with a notional value aggregating approximately  that are used to attain a floating rate of interest on a portion of our fixed rate debt  maturing in and these derivatives qualify for hedge accounting as discussed in note to our december  consolidated financial statements 
the instruments are valued by third parties 
the values of these derivatives will change over time as cash receipts and payments are made and as market conditions change 
stock based compensation through december   we have elected to account for our stock based compensation in accordance with apb no 
 which results in no compensation expense for options issued with an exercise price equal to the market value of our common shares on the grant date  instead of statement no 
 which would result in compensation expense being recorded based on the fair value of the stock based compensation issued 
beginning january   we will expense stock options under statement no 
liquidity and capital resources depending upon the availability and cost of external capital  we anticipate making additional investments in multifamily apartment communities 
new investments are expected to be funded from temporary borrowings under our revolving line of credit  internally generated cash and the proceeds derived from asset sales 
permanent financing for future investments  which replaces funds drawn under the revolving line of credit  is expected to be provided through a combination of public and private offerings of debt and equity securities and the assumption of secured debt 
we believe our liquidity and various sources of available capital are sufficient to fund operations  meet debt service and dividend requirements  and finance future investments

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risks relating to our operations result primarily from changes in short term libor interest rates 
we do not have any direct foreign exchange or other significant market risk 
our exposure to market risk for changes in interest rates relates primarily to our unsecured line of credit 
we primarily enter into fixed and variable rate debt obligations to support general corporate purposes  including acquisitions and development  capital expenditures and working capital needs 
we continuously evaluate our level of variable rate debt with respect to total debt and other factors  including its assessment of the current and future economic environment 
during  we entered into six interest rate swap agreements to attain a floating rate of interest on a portion of our fixed rate debt 
the objective of the agreements is to lower our overall borrowing costs 
the swaps hedge the fair market value of a portion of our debt 
we do not use derivatives for trading or speculative purposes 
the hedges are perfectly effective and  therefore  changes in the derivative fair value and the change in fair value of the hedged items during the hedging period exactly offset with no valuation impact on our current earnings 
see notes and in the notes to consolidated financial statements for additional information 
the fair values of our financial instruments including such items in the financial statement captions as cash  other assets  and unsecured line of credit approximate their carrying or contract values based on their nature  terms and interest rates that approximate current market rates 
the fair value of mortgage loans payable and unsecured senior notes is estimated using discounted cash flow analyses with an interest rate similar to that of current market borrowing arrangements 
the estimated fair value of our mortgage loans payable and unsecured senior notes is approximately  at december  we had  and  in variable rate debt outstanding at december  and  respectively 
a hypothetical adverse change in interest rates would have had an annualized unfavorable impact of approximately  and  on our earnings and cash flows based on these year end debt levels and our average variable interest rates for the years ended december  and  respectively 
we cannot predict the effect of adverse changes in interest rates on its variable rate debt and  therefore  its exposure to market risk  nor can there be any assurance that fixed rate  long term debt will be available to us at advantageous pricing 
consequently  future results may differ materially from the estimated adverse changes discussed above
