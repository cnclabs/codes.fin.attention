item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains forward looking statements relating to future events or the future financial performance of digimarc  which involve risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors  including those set forth under risks related to our business and risks related to our markets under item of part i above and elsewhere in this annual report on form k 
we assume no obligation to update this information 
this discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
overview we are a leading provider of patented digital watermarking technologies that allow imperceptible digital codes to be embedded in all forms of media content  including photographs  movies  music  banknotes and other financial instruments  personal identification documents  and product packages 
the embedded codes within various types of media content can be detected and read by software or hardware detectors in personal computers and other digital processing devices 
we also are a leading supplier of secure personal identification systems 
we supply the issuance systems for the majority of driver licenses produced in the united states and provide all or part of the issuance systems for national identifications  voter identifications  and driver licenses in more than twenty non us countries 
we are developing and marketing enhanced security for personal identification documents enabled by our proprietary digital watermarking technology 
the majority of our revenues come from multi year contracts with government agencies  including us state departments of motor vehicles and central banks 
we intend to increase our revenue through increasing adoption of our products and services  marketing new digital watermarking applications  and licensing our intellectual property 
we expect to target  among other sources of revenue  government agencies  commercial printers  packaging companies  publishers  advertisers  proprietors of large image collections  and other producers of printed materials 
our aim is to license our technologies to those content producers so that they may embed our digital watermarks in their printed media  such as identification documents  magazine advertisements and articles  direct mail coupons  catalogs  stationery and envelopes  product packaging  labels and tags  trading cards  credit cards  and business cards 
our current and anticipated products are intended to enable content producers to control reproduction and alteration of their content  as well as to enable their printed materials to provide a link to relevant network services 
revenue from our new applications may include one time license fees  time based or volume based fees  subscription fees  royalties and revenue sharing arrangements 
we anticipate that the calculation of fees and royalties will be based at least in part on the size of the installed base of personal computers  cameras  scanners  digital image capture and output devices  and software carrying our patented reader technology  as well as the nature of the use of  and the nature and amount of licensed content carrying  our digital watermarks 
since inception  we have invested a significant portion of our resources and capital in attracting top senior management  in developing our products and technology  and in building our sales and marketing organizations 
we have a limited operating history upon which investors may evaluate our business and prospects 
we have incurred significant losses to date  and as of december   we had an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
we intend to continue to expend significant financial and management resources on developing additional products and services  improving sales and marketing activities  advancing our technologies and expanding our operations 
our revenue may not increase or even continue at its current levels and we may not achieve or maintain profitability or generate cash from operations in future periods 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies deploying new technologies and applications 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to bad debts  inventories  intangible assets  income taxes  restructuring  long term service contracts  warranties  investments  and contingencies and litigation 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
certain of our accounting policies require higher degrees of judgment than others in their application 
these include revenue recognition on long term service contracts  impairments and estimation of useful lives of long lived assets  inventory valuation  and reserves for uncollectible accounts receivable 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition on long term service contracts we recognize revenue and profit as work progresses on long term  fixed price service contracts other than our long term identification and drivers license production contracts using the percentage of completion method  which relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we follow the percentage of completion method since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
revenue is recognized based on the percentage of completion of the contract using budgeted amounts established with the customer at the inception of the contract 
progress towards completion is measured using allowable costs incurred as compared to the budgeted amounts contained in the contract 
recognized revenue and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
revisions in profit estimates are charged to income in the period in which the facts that give rise to the revision become known 
any estimation process  including that used in preparing contract accounting models  involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to revenue and cost estimates in percentage of completion models through our contract approval and budget monitoring processes 
our estimates of revenue and costs on customer contracts change periodically in the normal course of business  occasionally due to modifications of our contractual arrangements 
we recognize revenue on long term identification and drivers license production contracts using a price per card method 
we use actual monthly volume amounts  if available  or we estimate the card production volume on a monthly basis for certain of these contracts in order to recognize revenue earned during the period 
in the case of estimates  when the actual production information becomes available  which is typically within four weeks  we bill the customer accordingly and any differences from the estimates are recognized in the month the billing occurs 
these amounts represent our best estimates of cards produced and are based on historical trends  known events during the month  and discussions with contract representatives 
the price per card is known  therefore  these estimates represent the best available information regarding revenue earned during that specific month 
the estimated amounts are recorded as unbilled receivables on the balance sheet until the actual production information is available and the billing occurs 
any estimation process involves inherent risk 
we reduce the inherent risk relating to production estimation through our approval and monitoring processes related to accounting estimates 
impairments and estimation of useful lives of long lived assets we periodically review long lived assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
we account for long lived assets in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions  and requires that long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles be reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
fair value is determined based on discounted cash flows or appraised values  depending on the nature of the asset 
inventory valuation inventory consists of consumable supplies that are used in the production of driver licenses and products held for resale to customers 
we value inventory at the lower of cost or market value which lower amount is the net realizable value 
we reduce the value of our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory write downs may be required 
reserve for uncollectible accounts receivable we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required
