item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the company is a holding company with twelve active wholly owned subsidiaries 
see business general included herein for a description of the company 
the company s revenue is primarily comprised of premiums  commissions and investment income 
the insurance companies derive their premium primarily from business written by the navigators agencies 
the lloyd s operations derive their premium from business written by nual 
the navigators agencies and nual receive commissions and  in some cases  profit commissions and service fees on the business produced 
critical accounting policies it is important to understand the company s accounting policies in order to understand its financial statements 
management considers certain of these policies to be critical to the presentation of the financial results since they require management to make estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosures at the financial reporting date and throughout the period being reported upon 
certain of the estimates result from judgments that can be subjective and complex  and consequently actual results may differ from these estimates  which would be reflected in future periods 
the company s most critical accounting policies involve the reporting of the reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses including losses that have occurred but were not reported to the company by the financial reporting date  reinsurance recoverables  written and unearned premium  the recoverability of deferred tax assets  the impairment of invested assets  accounting for lloyd s results  and goodwill 
loss reserves and lae 
the company s loss reserves are discussed under the business reserves section and note to the company s consolidated financial statements  both included herein 
loss reserves represent an estimate of the expected cost of the ultimate settlement and administration of losses  based on facts and circumstances then known 
actuarial methodologies are employed to assist in establishing such estimates and include judgments relative to estimates of future claims severity and frequency  length of time to develop to ultimate  judicial theories of liability and other third party factors which are often beyond our control 
due to the inherent uncertainty associated with the reserving process  the ultimate liability may be different from the original estimate 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year s results 
reinsurance recoverables 
reinsurance recoverables are established for the portion of the loss reserves that are ceded to reinsurers 
reinsurance recoverables are determined based upon the terms and conditions of reinsurance contracts which could be subject to interpretations that differ from our own based on judicial theories of liability 
in addition  we bear credit risk with respect to our reinsurers which can be significant considering that certain of the reserves remain outstanding for an extended period of time 
the company is required to pay losses even if a reinsurer fails to meet its obligations under the applicable reinsurance agreement 
see the business reinsurance ceded section and note to the company s consolidated financial statements  included herein 
written and unearned premium 
written premium is recorded based on the insurance policies that have been reported to the company and the policies that have been written by agents but not yet reported to the company 
the company must estimate the amount of written premium not yet reported based on judgments relative to current and historical trends of the business being written 
such estimates are regularly reviewed and updated and any resulting adjustments are included in the current year s results 
an unearned premium reserve is established to reflect the unexpired portion of each policy at the financial reporting date 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  included herein 
deferred tax assets 
the company has recorded valuation allowances related to deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards due to the uncertainty associated with the realization of the deferred tax asset related to certain of the company s foreign  state and local operations 
even though the company s foreign operations were profitable in  the valuation allowance was released only to the extent of the profits since future profitability remains uncertain 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  included herein 
impairment of invested assets 
impairment of investment securities results in a charge to operations when a market decline below cost is other than temporary 
management regularly reviews its fixed maturity and equity securities portfolios to evaluate the necessity of recording impairment losses for other than temporary declines in the fair value of investments 
a number of criteria are considered during this process including  but not limited to  the current fair value as compared to amortized cost or cost  as appropriate  of the security  the length of time the security s fair value has been below amortized cost or cost  and by how much  specific credit issues related to the issuer and current economic conditions 
in general  we focus our attention on those securities whose market value was less than of their amortized cost or cost  as appropriate  for six or more consecutive months 
other factors considered in evaluating potential impairment include the current fair value as compared to amortized cost or cost  as appropriate  the company s intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for an anticipated recovery in value  specific credit issues related to the issuer and current economic conditions 
other than temporary impairment losses result in a permanent reduction of the cost basis of the underlying investment 
significant changes in the factors the company considers when evaluating investments for impairment losses could result in a significant change in impairment losses reported in the consolidated financial statements 
for additional detail regarding the company s investment portfolio at december   including disclosures regarding other than temporary declines in investment value  see the business investments section and note to the company s consolidated financial statements  included herein 
accounting for lloyd s results 
we record our pro rata share of lloyd s syndicate assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  after making adjustments to convert lloyd s accounting to us gaap 
the most significant us gaap adjustments relate to income recognition 
lloyd s syndicates determine underwriting results by year of account at the end of three years 
we record adjustments to recognize underwriting results as incurred  including the expected ultimate cost of losses incurred 
these adjustments to losses are based on actuarial analysis of syndicate accounts  including forecasts of expected ultimate losses provided by the syndicates 
at the end of the lloyd s three year period for determining underwriting results for an account year  the syndicate will close the account year by reinsuring outstanding claims on that account year with the participants for the account s next underwriting year 
the amount to close an underwriting year into the next year is referred to as the reinsurance to close 
the reinsurance to close transactions are recorded as additional written and earned premium  losses incurred  loss reserves and receivables  all in the same amount 
there are no gains or losses recorded on the reinsurance to close transactions 
see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  included herein 
historically  the company reported funds due from lloyd s syndicate as a separate line item on its balance sheets 
the balance consisted primarily of investments  cash and premiums receivables resulting from the company s participation in lloyd s syndicate commencing in  the company has recorded the amounts due from lloyd s syndicate as part of their separate components in its financial statements 
as a result  the amounts previously classified as funds due from lloyd s syndicate have been reclassified to conform to the current year s presentation 
goodwill 
the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives from an amortization approach to an impairment only approach that requires that those assets be tested at least annually for impairment 
the company completed its impairment review resulting in no impairment of goodwill as of january  see note to the company s consolidated financial statements  included herein 
results of operations general 
the company s  and results of operations reflect increasing premium rates beginning in late and continuing in and the results of operations were adversely impacted by approximately million  both pretax and after tax  resulting from the september  terrorist attack on the world trade center consisting of estimated net incurred losses of million and the net effect of reinsurance reinstatement premiums of million  all of which originated from the company s lloyd s operations 
this represented the company s best estimate of its maximum exposure determined by an analysis of policies that may have incurred a loss resulting from the terrorist attack 
no additional losses related to the world trade center attack were incurred during however  given the uncertainty surrounding this event  the estimate may change over time as additional information becomes available

the and marine premium increased and  respectively  due to the increase in premium rates resulting in higher premiums on new and renewal business 
the improved pricing environment resulted in navigators insurance increasing its writing of new business 
the increased premium in of million resulted from million of new business and million from rate increases which averaged 
navigators insurance obtains its marine business through participation in the marine pool managed by the navigators agencies 
its participation in the marine pool was in  and general liability premium 
this business consists primarily of general liability insurance for general contractors and small artisans as well as small commercial risks 
the general liability premium increased from to and from to due to increased rates and expansion of the business 
the increased premium in of million resulted from million of new business and million of rate increases which averaged 
the new business and the rate increases resulted from a tightening market for california contractors liability insurance and expansion of the artisan business 
professional liability insurance 
in late  the insurance companies began to write professional liability insurance primarily consisting of directors and officers liability insurance for privately held and publicly traded corporations 
more recently  the professional liability business has been expanded to include errors and omissions insurance and employment practices liability coverages 
surety 
in late  navigators insurance began to write surety business which consists of bonds guaranteeing the performance of a specific obligation 
our focus is on providing bid and performance bonds to small contractors requiring contract bonds for projects of million or less 
onshore energy 
during  navigators insurance participated in the onshore energy business written by syndicate the business principally focuses on the oil and gas  chemical and petrochemical industries with coverages primarily for property damage and business interruption 
lloyd s operations the lloyd s premium is generated as the result of ncul and millennium providing capacity to lloyd s syndicate which is managed by nual 
lloyd s syndicate had stamp capacity of million million in  million million in and million million in syndicate s capacity is expressed net of commission as is standard at lloyd s of approximately 
syndicate entered into a qualifying quota share agreement with a major reinsurer which increased the gross premium that could be written by syndicate for the underwriting year from its stamp capacity of million to a total of million million 
a qualifying quota share is a reinsurance contract which provides additional capacity to lloyd s syndicates in order that they may write premiums up to in excess of their stamp capacity 
only high quality reinsurers approved by lloyd s can enter into a qualifying quota share transaction with a lloyd s syndicate 
the company participates for  and of syndicate s capacity for the  and underwriting years  respectively 
the lloyd s marine business had been subject to pricing competition for several years through the pricing competition showed some signs of easing in and prices increased in and lloyd s presents its results on an underwriting year basis  generally closing each underwriting year after three years 
the company makes estimates for each year and timely accrues the expected results 
the lloyd s operations included in the consolidated financial statements represent the company s participation in syndicate lloyd s syndicates report the amounts of premiums  claims  and expenses recorded in an underwriting account for a particular year to the companies or individuals that participate in the syndicates 
the syndicates generally keep accounts open for three years 
traditionally  three years have been necessary to report substantially all premiums associated with an underwriting year and to report most related claims  although claims may remain unsettled after the account is closed 
a lloyd s syndicate typically closes an underwriting account by reinsuring outstanding claims on that account with the participants for the next underwriting year 
the ceding participants pay the assuming participants an amount based on the unearned premiums and outstanding claims in the underwriting account at the date of the assumption 
our participation in lloyd s syndicate is represented by and recorded as our proportionate share of the underlying assets and liabilities and results of operations of the syndicate since  a we hold an undivided interest in each asset  b we are proportionately liable for each liability and c syndicate is not a separate legal entity 
at lloyd s  the amount to close an underwriting year into the next year is referred to as the reinsurance to close 
the reinsurance to close amounts represent the transfer of the assets and liabilities from the participants of a closing underwriting year to the participants of the next underwriting year 
to the extent our participation in the syndicate changes as a result of this transfer  the reinsurance to close amounts vary accordingly 
in our case  our participation increased from in to in  to in  and to in we therefore recorded our increasing proportionate share of the assets and liabilities of syndicate at december   and  the company closed its  and underwriting years  respectively  the net effect of which resulted in such transfers to ncul and millennium of million  million and million  respectively 
these transactions accounted for part of the increases in the premium volume in the lloyd s operations 
the reinsurance to close transactions were recorded as additional written and earned premium  losses incurred  loss reserves and receivables  all in the same amount 
there were no gains or losses recorded on the transactions 
the company also purchased an additional   of capacity for through an annual auction process in at a total cost of  
the company provides letters of credit to lloyd s to support its participation in syndicate s capacity 
if the company increases its participation or if lloyd s changes the capital requirements  the company may be required to supply additional letters of credit or other collateral acceptable to lloyd s  or reduce the capacity of syndicate the letters of credit are provided through the credit facility which the company maintains with a consortium of banks 
the credit facility agreement requires that the banks vote whether or not to renew the letter of credit portion of the facility each year 
if the banks decide not to renew the letter of credit facility  the company will need to find other sources to provide the letters of credit or other collateral in order to continue to participate in syndicate marine premium 
in  marine premium increased from partially due to the increase in premium rates resulting in higher premiums on renewal and new business and due to the capacity provided to syndicate by ncul and millennium increasing from in to in the higher premium rates averaging approximately made the business more attractive resulting in the lloyd s operations increasing its writings of new business 
the increased premium volume in compared to was also due to the increase in premium rates and to the capacity provided to syndicate by ncul and millennium increasing from in to in engineering and construction premium 
the business consists of coverage for construction projects including machinery  equipment and loss of use due to delays 
the increases in the gross written premium in and were due to new business 
onshore energy 
the business principally focuses on the oil and gas  chemical and petrochemical industries with coverages primarily for property damage and business interruption 
the increases in the gross written premium in and were due to new business and rate increases 
the increase was approximately new business and rate increases 
ceded written premium 
in the ordinary course of business  the company reinsures certain insurance risks with unaffiliated insurance companies for the purpose of limiting its maximum loss exposure  protecting against catastrophic losses  and maintaining desired ratios of net premiums written to statutory surplus 
the relationship of ceded premium to gross written premium varies based upon the types of business written and whether the business is written by the insurance companies or the lloyd s operations 
the amount of ceded premium in increased over due to the increase in gross written premium and the increase in reinsurance rates in the percentage of the lloyd s operations ceded premium increased from in to in due to additional quota share reinsurance 
the percentage of the insurance companies premium which was ceded decreased from in to in primarily due to the increase in the general liability insurance premium of which the insurance companies retain more of the premium than in the other lines of business 
the increase in ceded premium in the lloyd s operations from in to in was due to slightly higher reinsurance rates 
the insurance companies percentage of ceded premium decreased from in to in primarily due to the increase in the specialty insurance 
net written premium 
net written premium increased from to due to the increase in the gross written premium partially offset by the increase in the percentage of ceded premium from in to in net written premium increased from to primarily due to the increase in the gross written premium and the decrease in the percentage of premium ceded 
net earned premium 
net earned premium increased due to the increase in the net written premium 
commission income 
the increases in commission income from to of and from to of were due to the increase in marine premium for which the company receives commission from unaffiliated insurers 
net investment income 
net investment income decreased in from the previous year due to lower interest rates during partially offset by increased invested assets 
investment income increased during from primarily due to an increase in investment income allocated to ncul and millennium from the investments at the lloyd s syndicates due to their increased participation in syndicate  reduction in the insurance companies municipal portfolio  reduction in the expenses to manage the portfolio and the increase in the size of the portfolio

lloyd s informed the company in that it was liable for part of the adverse development in the lloyd s syndicates in which rcul provided capacity in and the company had provided a letter of credit to rcul in order for rcul to participate on various lloyd s syndicates 
the company believes that it has no further exposure to rcul 
operating expenses net losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred 
the ratio of net loss and loss adjustment expenses incurred to net earned premium was  and in  and  respectively 
the decrease in the loss ratio from to was primarily due to the losses resulting from approximately million of net losses related to the september  terrorist attack on the world trade center accounting for points of the loss ratio and from approximately million of net losses resulting from one large offshore energy claim petrobras in the first quarter of accounting for points of the loss ratio 
gross losses resulting from the terrorist attack were million with the ceded portion of the losses reinsured by highly rated reinsurers 
in october  million of the losses were paid and fully recovered from the reinsurers 
the increase in the loss ratio compared to was primarily due to the losses described above 
the company does not discount any of its loss reserves 
the following table sets forth the company s net loss reserves by segment and line of insurance business as of the date indicated as of december  in thousands insurance companies marine    general liability    professional liability  surety onshore energy    other reserves on run off business    total insurance companies    lloyd s operations marine    engineering and construction onshore energy total lloyd s operations    total net loss reserves    as previously discussed under the caption business reserves there are a number of factors that could cause actual losses and lae to differ materially from the amount that the company has reserved for losses and lae 
the risks and uncertainties associated with setting reserves include both fact specific matters associated with particular claims as well as general trends and developments that affect all of our lines of business 
these general trends and developments include changes in the judicial  legislative and social environments as well as changes in economic conditions and claims handling practices 
in particular  our reserves in the marine line of business over time tend to be most affected by inflation and other economic conditions as well as the uncertainties previously discussed under business environmental pollution and asbestos related claims with respect to any asbestos and environmental exposure we have within this line 
general uncertainties that we expect may have a large impact on our general liability reserves include changing federal and state regulation and judicial interpretation as well as general social trends that affect the liability claims made in this line 
finally  engineering and construction claims are also particularly impacted by general trends relating to liability theories and inflation 
the increases in the loss reserves for the marine and general liability insurance was primarily due to the reserves on the increased premium volume 
the company started writing professional liability insurance in late the company s reinsurance security committee monitors the financial strength of its reinsurers and the amounts of reinsurance receivables from those reinsurers 
a reserve is established for any amounts considered uncollectible 
at december  and  the company had an allowance for uncollectible reinsurance of  and  respectively

the same ratios without the reinsurance to close premium were  and in  and  respectively 
the and commission expense ratios were similar 
the decrease in the commission expense ratio compared to was primarily due to the increase in the insurance companies net earned premium for the marine business 
the reinsurance to close premium increased earned premium but did not change the commission expense  therefore the ratio of commission expense to earned premium decreased 
other operating expenses 
the increases in other operating expenses of in and in were primarily employee related expenses resulting from expansion of the business as discussed under the revenues section included herein 
interest expense

as of december  and  the net deferred federal  foreign  state and local tax asset was million and million  respectively 
at december  the company had a million valuation allowance against its deferred tax asset compared to a million valuation allowance at december  the valuation allowance has been maintained because of the uncertainty associated with the realization of the deferred tax asset for the carryforward of operating losses from certain of the company s foreign  state and local operations 
even though the company s foreign operations were profitable in  the valuation allowance was released only to the extent of the profits since future profitability remains uncertain 
the company will continue to evaluate the valuation allowance based on the results of its foreign  state and local operations 
net income 
the company had net income of million in  million in and million in the increase in net income from to was primarily due to overall improved profitability in the insurance operations 
the decrease in net income from to was primarily due to the losses resulting from the september  terrorist attack on the world trade center 
liquidity and capital resources cash flow provided by operations was million  million and million for   and  respectively 
the increases in the and operating cash flows were primarily due to the increases in net written premium 
operating cash flow was used primarily to acquire additional investment assets and to reduce debt

as of december   all fixed maturity securities and equity securities held by the company were classified as available for sale 
the average rating of the company s fixed maturity investments is aa by standard poor s and aa by moody s 
the company has no significant exposure to credit risk since the fixed maturity investment portfolio consists of investment grade bonds 
the portfolio has an average maturity of years and a duration of years 
management continually monitors the composition and cash flow of the investment portfolio in order to maintain the appropriate levels of liquidity to ensure the company s ability to satisfy claims 
the company incurred impairment losses of million in and million in on asset backed securities 
the increase in reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses and the related increase in the reinsurance receivable on paid and unpaid losses and loss adjustment expenses at december  as compared to was primarily due to the reserves on the increase in the earned premium in compared to the company s bank credit facility provides a million revolving line of credit at an interest rate of either  at the company s election  the base commercial lending rate of one of the banks or at libor plus on the used portion of the line of credit

pursuant to the implementation of lloyd s plan of reconstruction and renewal  a portion of the company s recoverables are now reinsured by equitas a separate uk authorized reinsurance company established to reinsure outstanding liabilities of all lloyd s members for all risks written in the or prior years of account 
the company believes that the cash flow generated by the operating activities of the company s subsidiaries will provide sufficient funds for the company to meet its liquidity needs over the next twelve months 
beyond the next twelve months  cash flow available to the company may be influenced by a variety of factors  including general economic conditions and conditions in the insurance and reinsurance markets  as well as fluctuations from year to year in claims experience 
economic conditions the company is a specialty insurance company and periods of moderate economic recession or inflation tend not to have a significant direct affect on the company s underwriting operations 
they do  however  impact the company s investment portfolio 
a decrease in interest rates will tend to decrease the company s yield and have a positive effect on the fair value of its invested assets 
an increase in interest rates will tend to increase the company s yield and have a negative effect on the fair value of its invested assets 
management considers the potential impact of these economic trends in estimating loss reserves 
management believes that the underwriting controls it maintains  and the fact that a significant amount of the company s business is in lines of insurance which have relatively short loss payout patterns  assist in estimating ultimate claim costs more reasonably and lessen the potential adverse impact of the economy on the company 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk market risk market risk is the risk of loss arising from adverse changes in market rates and prices  such as interest rates  foreign currency exchange rates  and other relevant market rate or price changes 
market risk is directly influenced by the volatility and liquidity in the markets in which the related underlying assets are traded 
the following is a discussion of the company s primary market risk exposures and how those exposures are currently managed as of december  the company s market risk sensitive instruments are entered into for purposes other than trading 
the carrying value of the company s investment portfolio as of december  was million of which was invested in fixed maturity securities 
the primary market risk to the investment portfolio is interest rate risk associated with investments in fixed maturity securities 
the company s exposure to equity price risk and foreign exchange risk is not significant 
the company has no commodity risk 
for fixed maturity securities  short term liquidity needs and the potential liquidity needs of the business are key factors in managing the portfolio 
the portfolio duration relative to the liabilities duration is primarily managed through investment transactions 
there were no significant changes regarding the investment portfolio in the company s primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures were managed compared to the year ended december   other than the impairment losses of million in and million in recorded on three of the company s asset backed securities 
the company does not currently anticipate significant changes in its primary market risk exposures or in how those exposures are managed in future reporting periods based upon what is known or expected to be in effect in future reporting periods 
the company is subject to interest rate risk on its notes payable to banks as changes in interest rates would impact future earnings  however  this interest rate risk exposure is not considered significant 
sensitivity analysis sensitivity analysis is defined as the measurement of potential loss in future earnings  fair values or cash flows of market sensitive instruments resulting from one or more selected hypothetical changes in interest rates and other market rates or prices over a selected time 
in the company s sensitivity analysis model  a hypothetical change in market rates is selected that is expected to reflect reasonably possible near term changes in those rates 
the term near term means a period of time going forward up to one year from the date of the consolidated financial statements 
actual results may differ from the hypothetical change in market rates assumed in this disclosure  especially since this sensitivity analysis does not reflect the results of any actions that would be taken by the company to mitigate such hypothetical losses in fair value 
in this sensitivity analysis model  the company uses fair values to measure its potential loss 
the sensitivity analysis model includes fixed maturities and short term investments 
the primary market risk to the company s market sensitive instruments is interest rate risk 
the sensitivity analysis model uses a basis point change in interest rates to measure the hypothetical change in fair value of financial instruments included in the model 
for invested assets  modified duration modeling is used to calculate changes in fair values 
durations on invested assets are adjusted for call  put and interest rate reset features 
duration on tax exempt securities is adjusted for the fact that the yield on such securities is less sensitive to changes in interest rates compared to treasury securities 
invested asset portfolio durations are calculated on a market value weighted basis  including accrued investment income  using holdings as of december  the sensitivity analysis model used by the company produces a loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments of million based on a basis point increase in interest rates as of december  this loss amount only reflects the impact of an interest rate increase on the fair value of the company s fixed maturities and short term investments  which constitute approximately of total assets as of december  the loss in fair value of market sensitive instruments  as a result of a basis point increase in interest rates as of december   is not material
