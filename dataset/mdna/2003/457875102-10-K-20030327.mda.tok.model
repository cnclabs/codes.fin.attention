the company s actual results could differ materially from those discussed or implied herein 
factors that could cause or contribute to such differences include  but are not limited to  those discussed in factors that may affect future results above 
among these risks are fluctuations in the actual cash value of salvage vehicles  changes in the market value of salvage  the quality and quantity of inventory available from suppliers  the ability to pass through increased towing costs  that vehicle processing time will improve  legislative or regulatory acts  competition  the availability of suitable acquisition candidates and greenfield opportunities  the ability to bring new facilities to expected earnings targets  the dependence on key insurance company suppliers  the ability of the company and its outside consultants to successfully complete the re design of the company s information systems  both in a timely manner and according to costs and operational specifications  and the level of energy and labor costs 
overview insurance auto auctions  inc provides insurance companies and other vehicle suppliers cost effective salvage processing solutions principally on a consignment or purchase agreement method of sale 
the consignment method includes both a percentage of sale and fixed fee basis 
the percentage of sale consignment method offers potentially increased profits over fixed fee consignment by providing incentives to both the company and the salvage provider to invest in vehicle enhancements  thereby  maximizing vehicle selling prices 
under the percentage of sale and fixed fee consignment methods  the vehicle is not owned by the company and only the fees associated with processing the vehicle are recorded as revenue 
the proceeds from the sale of the vehicle itself are not included in revenue 
under the purchase agreement sales method  the vehicle is owned by the company  and the proceeds from the sale of the vehicle are recorded as revenue 
the company s operating results are subject to fluctuations  including quarterly fluctuations  that can result from a number of factors  some of which are more significant for sales under the purchase agreement method

critical accounting policies the preparation of the consolidated financial statement in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  as well as the related disclosures 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and on various assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
as such  the company continuously evaluates its estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect its more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
goodwill the company has significant goodwill recorded in its consolidated financial statements 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no   goodwill and other intangible assets  the company assesses goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis or whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value of this asset may not be recoverable 
important factors that could trigger an impairment review include significant under performance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in the company s stock price for a sustained period  and the company s market capitalization relative to net book value 
if the company determines that the carrying value of goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  the company would measure any impairment based upon a projected discounted cash flow 
deferred income taxes the company has recorded deferred tax assets related to net operating losses incurred in several of the states where it operates 
the company has determined that it may not realize the full tax benefit related to certain of the deferred tax assets 
as such  a valuation allowance to reduce the carrying value of the deferred tax assets has been recorded 
long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles the company evaluates long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the asset s carrying amount to the estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if the estimated undiscounted future cash flows change in the future  the company may be required to reduce the carrying amount of an asset to its fair value

fin requires that a guarantor recognize a liability for the fair value of an obligation assumed under a guarantee

the initial measurement and recognition requirements of fin are effective prospectively for guarantees issued or modified after december  however  the disclosure requirements are effective for the company for the year ended december  adoption of the disclosure provisions of fin did not have a material effect on the company s consolidated financial statements
