liquidity and capital resources during  the company developed its refinancing plan to address its debt and lease obligations maturing during  comprised primarily of million of its old debentures due october  on september   the company completed the refinancing plan and repaid the old debentures primarily through the completion of the hcpi transactions and the exchange offer 
as a result of successfully completing its refinancing plan  the company reduced its current maturities of long term debt from million at december  to million at december  see notes and to the consolidated financial statements 
in addition  pursuant to the refinancing plan  since november  the company has consummated sale lease back transactions relating to communities and various other mortgage refinancing and capital raising transactions  which in the aggregate generated gross proceeds of approximately million 
the company used approximately million of the proceeds to repay related debt and to fund reserve and escrow requirements related to these transactions 
the company used the remaining million of proceeds to pay transaction costs associated with the refinancing plan and for working capital 
as a result of the refinancing plan  the company has extended the maturity of substantially all of its debt arrangements to january or later 
as part of these extensions and refinancings  the company has replaced a significant amount of mortgage debt with higher cost debt and leases  increasing the company s annual debt and lease payments by approximately million 
in addition  the interest costs under the hcpi loan and the series b notes are significantly higher than the interest cost of the old debentures 
assuming that the company elects to pay of the interest on the series b notes through the issuance of additional series b notes rather than cash  the hcpi loan and series b note interest payments would be higher than the corresponding interest payments under the old debentures by approximately million 
in addition  the company will accrue additional interest expense that is not currently payable  pursuant to the hcpi loan and the series b notes  which will be approximately million for fiscal certain of the company s current debt and lease agreements contain various financial and other restrictive covenants  which may restrict the company s flexibility in operating its business 
the company obtained waivers of certain covenants as of december  the company believes that projected results from operations and cash flows will be sufficient to satisfy these covenants for the foreseeable future 
however  there can be no assurances that the company will remain in compliance with those covenants or that the company s creditors will grant amendments or waivers in the event of future non compliance 
furthermore  because of cross default and cross collateralization provisions in many of the company s mortgages  debt instruments  and leases  a default by the company on one of its payment obligations could result in default or acceleration of many of the company s other obligations 
failure to remain in compliance with its financial covenants could have a material adverse impact on the company 
a significant amount of the company s indebtedness and lease agreements is cross defaulted 
any non payment or other default with respect to such obligations including non compliance with a financial or restrictive covenant could cause the company s lenders to declare defaults  accelerate payment obligations or foreclose upon the communities securing such indebtedness or exercise their remedies with respect to such communities 
furthermore  because of cross default and cross collateralization provisions in most of the company s mortgages  debt instruments  and leases  a default by the company on one of its debt instruments or lease agreements is likely to result in a default or acceleration of substantially all of the company s other obligations  which would have a material adverse effect on the company

 the company has reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all intangible assets acquired in purchase business combinations  and has determined that no amortization period adjustments are required 
as of december   the company has not identified any intangible assets with indefinite useful lives  other than goodwill 
the transitional provisions of sfas no 
require the company to perform an assessment of whether there is an indication that goodwill was impaired as of the date of adoption 
to accomplish this  the company identified its reporting units and determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
for purposes of allocating and evaluating goodwill and intangible assets  the company considers retirement centers and free standing als as its reporting units 
all recorded goodwill as of the date of adoption was attributable to the retirement center reporting unit

for recognizing and measuring impairment losses on long lived assets held for use and long lived assets to be disposed of by sale 
sfas no 
retains the basic provisions of apb opinion no 
on how to present discontinued operations in the income statement but broadens that presentation to include a component of an entity rather than a segment of a business 
unlike sfas no 
 an impairment assessment under sfas no 
will never result in a write down of goodwill

sfas no 
also amends sfas no 
to require sale lease back accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects similar to sale lease back transactions 
the provisions of the statement related to the rescission of statement no 
are applied in fiscal years beginning after may  the impact of the adoption of the statement related to the rescission of statement no 
will be dependent upon the level of gains or losses from the extinguishment of debt occurring during the year ended and beyond

impact of inflation inflation could affect the company s future revenues and results of operations because of  among other things  the company s dependence on senior residents  many of whom rely primarily on fixed incomes to pay for the company s services

ability to increase cash flow from operations the company has experienced significant losses from operations during the past several years  and must significantly increase its cash flow from operations in order to meet its future debt and lease payment obligations 
these increases are contingent on the company s ability to increase its occupancy  and to increase its rates for monthly service fees to recover its cost increases  and to implement additional increases to monthly service and other fees in order to improve its operating results 
these increases are also contingent on the company s ability to derive significant entrance fee sales each year through the remarketing of available units at its ef communities  and to maintain and increase the price level of these units

table of contents dependence on attracting residents with sufficient resources to pay approximately of the company s total revenues for were attributable to private pay sources 
the company expects to continue to rely primarily on the ability of residents to pay for the company s services from their own or familial financial resources  or long term care insurance 
many residents and prospective residents experienced decreased investment earnings  low interest rates on savings  and significant decreases in the market values of their retirement savings during the past two years

highly competitive industry the senior living and health care services industry is highly competitive  and the company expects that all providers within the industry will continue to be competitive in the future 
the company competes with other companies providing independent living  assisted living  skilled nursing  and other similar service and care alternatives 
although the company believes there is a need for senior living communities in the markets where the company is operating and developing communities  the company expects that competition will continue from existing competitors and new market entrants  some of whom may have substantially greater financial resources than the company 
in addition  some of the company s competitors operate on a not for profit basis or as charitable organizations and have the ability to finance capital expenditures on a tax exempt basis or through the receipt of charitable contributions  neither of which are readily available to the company 
the company also competes with many assisted living companies that are currently insolvent or that could become insolvent in the future 
these competitors may gain a competitive advantage over the company as a result of the effect of bankruptcy reorganization or other insolvency proceedings 
furthermore  the development of new free standing al communities has exceeded the demand for such communities in certain of the markets in which the company has free standing al communities 
an oversupply of such communities in certain of the company s markets has caused the company to experience slower fill up than projected  competitive pricing pressures and price discounting 
there can be no assurance that the company will not continue to encounter these conditions or that competitive conditions will not adversely affect its financial condition  liquidity  or results of operations 
community management  staffing  and labor costs the company competes with other providers of senior living and health care services with respect to attracting and retaining qualified management personnel responsible for the day to day operations of each of the company s communities and skilled technical personnel responsible for providing resident care 
in certain markets  a shortage of nurses or trained personnel has required the company to enhance its wage and benefits package in order to compete in the hiring and retention of such personnel or to hire more expensive temporary personnel 
the company will also be heavily dependent on the available labor pool of semi skilled and unskilled employees in each of the markets in which it operates 
the company has experienced a competitive labor market  periodic shortages of qualified workers in certain markets  and increasing wage rates for many of these employees during the past year 
the company cannot be sure its labor costs will not increase  or that  if they do increase  they can be matched by corresponding increases in rates charged to residents 
if the company is unable to attract and 
table of contents retain qualified management and staff personnel  control its labor costs  or pass on increased labor costs to residents through rate increases  the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations would be adversely affected 
exposure to rising interest rates future indebtedness  from commercial banks or otherwise  and lease obligations  including those related to reit facilities  are expected to be based on interest rates prevailing at the time such debt and lease arrangements are obtained

increases in prevailing interest rates would increase the company s interest or lease payment obligations and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition  and results of operations 
risks associated with lifecare benefits six of the communities operated by the company are lifecare ef communities that offer residents a limited lifecare benefit 
residents of these communities pay an upfront entrance fee upon occupancy  of which a portion is generally refundable  with an additional monthly service fee while living in the community 
this limited lifecare benefit is typically a a certain number of free days in the community s health center during the resident s lifetime  b a discounted rate for such services  or c a combination of the two 
the lifecare benefit varies based upon the extent to which the resident s entrance fee is refundable 
the pricing of entrance fees  refundability provisions  monthly service fees  and lifecare benefits are determined from actuarial projections of the expected morbidity and mortality of the resident population 
in the event the entrance fees and monthly service payments established for the communities are not sufficient to cover the cost of lifecare benefits granted to residents  the results of operations and financial condition of the communities would be adversely affected 
residents of the company s ef communities are guaranteed a living unit and nursing care at the community during their lifetime  even if the resident exhausts his or her financial resources and becomes unable to satisfy his or her obligations to the community 
in addition  in the event a resident requires nursing care and there is insufficient capacity for the resident in the nursing facility at the community where the resident lives  the community must contract with a third party to provide such care 
although the company screens potential residents to ensure that they have adequate assets  income  and reimbursements from government programs and third parties to pay their obligations to the communities during their lifetime  there can be no assurance that such assets  income  and reimbursements will be sufficient in all cases 
if insufficient  the company has rights of set off against the refundable portions of the residents deposits  and would also seek available reimbursement under medicaid or other available programs 
to the extent that the financial resources of some of the residents are not sufficient to pay for the cost of facilities and services provided to them  or in the event that the communities must pay third parties to provide nursing care to residents of the communities  the company s results of operations and financial condition would be adversely affected 
risks of operations in concentrated geographic areas part of the company s business strategy is to own  lease or manage senior living communities in concentrated geographic service areas 
the company has a large concentration of communities in florida  texas  arizona and colorado  among other areas 
accordingly  the company s occupancy rates and operating results in certain of its communities may be adversely affected by a number of factors  including regional and local economic conditions  competitive conditions  applicable local laws and regulations  and general real estate market conditions  including the supply and proximity of other senior living communities
