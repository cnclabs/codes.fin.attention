item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the following section presents management s discussion and analysis of the financial condition and results of operations of pennrock financial services corp  a bank holding company pennrock  its subsidiaries  the national advisory group  inc national  pension consulting services  inc 
pcs and blue ball national bank the bank  and the bank s subsidiary  pennrock insurance group  inc pigi 
this discussion and analysis is presented to assist the reader in understanding and evaluating the financial condition  results of operations and future prospects of pennrock and should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and other financial data presented elsewhere in this annual report 
pennrock s results of operations are dependent primarily on its net interest income  which is the difference between the interest earned on its assets primarily its loan and securities portfolios and its cost of funds  which consists of the interest paid on its deposits and borrowings 
pennrock s results of operations are also affected by its provision for loan losses as well as non interest income  non interest expenses and income tax expense 
non interest expenses consist of salaries and benefits  occupancy and equipment expenses  advertising and marketing  data processing  insurance  professional fees  telecommunications and other operating expenses 
results of operations are also dependent on the dollar volume and asset quality of pennrock s loans and investments 
the results of pennrock s operations  like those of other financial institutions  are affected by our asset and liability management policies  as well as factors beyond our control  such as general economic conditions and the monetary and fiscal policies of the federal government 
lending activities are affected by the demand for commercial and mortgage financing and other types of loans  and are thus influenced by interest rates and other economic factors 
deposit flows and costs of funds are influenced by yields available on competing banking and non banking investments and by general market rates of interest

management s greatest challenge in implementing its policies is the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently pennrock financial services corp 
less than certain 
for a detailed discussion of pennrock s significant accounting policies  see note summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
a material estimate that is susceptible to significant change is the determination of the allowance for loan losses 
estimates of the amount of the allowance for loan losses and the placement of loans on non accrual status both affect the carrying amount of the loan portfolio 
the allowance for loan losses is a difficult subjective judgment that management must make regarding the loan portfolio  and is established and maintained at levels that management believes are adequate to cover losses resulting from the inability of borrowers to make required payments on loans 
to estimate loan losses  we analyze i 
historical loan losses  ii 
current trends in delinquencies and charge offs  iii 
plans for problem loan administration and resolution  iv 
the views of regulators  v 
changes in the size and composition of the loan portfolio  vi 
peer group information  vii 
the economic climate and direction  viii 
increases or decreases in overall lending rates  ix 
political conditions  x 
legislation directly or indirectly impacting the banking industry  and xi 
economic conditions affecting specific geographical areas in which pennrock conducts business 
where there is a question as to the impairment of a specific loan  management obtains valuations of the property or collateral securing the loan  and current financial information of the borrower  including financial statements  when available 
since the calculation of appropriate loan loss allowances relies on management s estimates and judgments relating to inherently uncertain events  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the american institute of certified public accountants is preparing further guidance for calculating the allowance for loan losses 
implementation of that guidance could result in an adjustment to the allowance

results of operations net interest income net interest income is the amount by which interest income on loans  investments and other earning assets exceeds interest paid on deposits  borrowings and other interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income is the primary source of revenue for pennrock 
the amount of net interest income earned is affected by changes in interest rates and the balances of the various types of earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
for comparative purposes  and throughout this discussion unless otherwise noted  net interest income and corresponding yields are shown on a taxable equivalent basis 
this adjustment will give effect to the interest earned on tax exempt loans and investments by an amount equivalent to the federal income taxes  which would have been paid if the income received on these assets were taxable at the statutory rate of for and for  and net interest income is the product of the volume of average earning assets and the average rates earned on them  less the volume of average interest bearing liabilities and the average rates paid on them

over the average balance of interest earning assets grew million in over while the average balance of interest bearing liabilities grew million 
the increase in average interest earning assets generated million of additional interest income while the increase in average interest bearing liabilities generated only million of additional interest expense  resulting in an increase of million of net interest income due to changes in volumes 
pennrock financial services corp 
another factor that contributed to the change in our net interest income was the change in interest rates 
the average rate earned on earning assets declined percentage points which caused interest income to decline million in the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities declined percentage points which caused interest expense to decline million 
since interest income declined by more than interest expense  net interest income declined by million due to changes in interest rates 
over the average balance of interest earning assets increased by million in over while the average balance of interest bearing liabilities increased million 
the increase in average interest earning assets generated million of additional interest income while the interest expense on interest bearing liabilities actually declined by  due to changes in the mix of the interest bearing liabilities 
net interest income increased million due to changes in volumes

the primary source of non taxable interest income for pennrock has traditionally been from interest earned on municipal bonds that the bank held in its available for sale portfolio 
since the municipal bonds that the bank normally purchases have maturity dates of years and longer  these bonds tend to lengthen the average life of the portfolio 
as market interest rates fell in and  we restructured the portfolio over the two year period to shorten the average life of the portfolio 
as a result  we replaced longer term municipal bonds with primarily shorter term taxable securities 
the average balance of municipal bonds owned by the bank fell from million in to million in and to million in with a smaller investment in municipal bonds  the interest earned on a taxable equivalent basis from municipal bonds declined each year as well  falling from million in to million in and to million in to help offset the decline in the tax free interest earned from the municipal bond portfolio  we purchased adjustable rate and short term callable fannie mae and federal home loan mortgage corporation fhlmc preferred stock 
the dividends earned on fannie mae and fhlmc preferred stock are tax free  which helped replace some  but not all  of the tax free income lost from the municipal bond portfolio 
the bank s investment in preferred stock increased from million in to million in and to million in the dividends earned on a taxable equivalent basis from the preferred stock portfolio increased from  in to million in and to million in as a result of this restructuring and the resulting decline in tax free income earned over the three year period  the tax equivalent adjustment as shown in table declined from million in to million in and to million in changes in interest rates as well as changes in average balances or volumes of earning assets and paying liabilities have an impact on the amount of net interest income earned and the net interest margins realized by pennrock from year to year 
by isolating the effect that changes in rates have on net interest income from the effect of changes in volume  we can analyze the degree that each influences the change in net interest income and net interest margins 
table analyzes the changes in the volume and rate components of net interest income

the interest rate spread as shown in table is the difference between the average rate earned on earning assets and the average rate paid on interest bearing liabilities 
the net interest margin takes into account the benefit derived from assets funded by interest free sources such as non interest bearing demand deposits and capital

the yield on securities available for sale declined basis points while loan yields declined percentage points 
although the prime rate was only cut once in  by percentage points  the yields on earning assets declined by more than prime due to maturities  repayments and refinancing of higher yielding securities and loans being reinvested at substantially lower rates 
the rate paid on interest bearing deposits declined basis points not only due to lower deposit rates but also because of a shift of balances from higher cost time deposits to lower cost interest bearing demand and savings deposits 
the average balance of time deposits dropped million and the average balance of interest bearing demand and savings balances increased million 
the average cost of borrowed funds declined percentage points in the average rate paid on total interest bearing liabilities declined percentage points 
pennrock financial services corp 
both the interest rate spread and the net interest margin grew by percentage points in the yield on earning assets declined by percentage points but this was more than offset by a percentage point decrease in the cost of funds 
the prime rate was cut in half during  from to by the end of the year as the federal reserve lowered rates on different occasions 
the decline in market rates had a greater impact on the yield of securities available for sale which declined percentage points  while loan yields dropped only percentage points  benefiting from an increase in loan fees of  over loan fees earned in interest bearing deposit costs decreased percentage points as both interest bearing demand deposit and time deposit rates dropped by percentage points during the year 
short term borrowings costs decreased percentage points and the rates paid on long term debt dropped percentage points in provision for loan losses the amount of provision for loan losses that was charged against earnings was million in compared with million in and million in the amount of the provision is based  among other factors  on the amount of realized net credit losses 
net credit losses totaled million in   in and million in we review the adequacy of the allowance in light of past loan loss experience  current economic conditions  size and characteristics of the loan portfolio  volume of non performing and delinquent loans and other relevant information

securities gains and losses in all three years were attributable to sales of pennrock s equity portfolio and to the sale of other securities for the purpose of adding liquidity  to control interest rate risk and reflect the bank s active management of the available for sale security portfolio 
we continuously monitor pennrock s interest rate sensitivity position and periodically restructure the security portfolio as conditions warrant such as expected changes in liquidity or projected movements in future interest rates

 accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  a deferred tax asset or liability is determined based on the enacted tax rates which will be in effect when the differences between the financial statement carrying amounts and tax basis of existing assets and liabilities are expected to be reported in pennrock s income tax returns 
the deferred tax provision for the year is equal to the net change in the deferred tax asset and liability accounts from the beginning to the end of the year 
the effect on deferred taxes of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
the principal types of accounts that result in differences between assets and liabilities for financial statement and tax return purposes are the allowance for loan losses  accumulated depreciation of fixed assets and the value of securities available for sale

substantially all of the gross losses were attributable to floating rate corporate notes held in the bank s afs portfolio and in equities held in pennrock s afs portfolio 
the valuation of the corporate notes and the equities have been depressed by the decline in the financial markets over the past two years

all declines in market value in the two afs portfolios have been determined to be temporary in nature

pennrock had million in mortgage backed pass through securities as of december  of which  was adjustable rate and million were fixed rate securities 
a cmo is a mortgage backed security that is comprised of classes of bonds created by prioritizing the cash flows from the underlying mortgage pool in order to meet different objectives of investors 
pennrock had million in cmo securities at the end of all of which were fixed rate 
none of the cmos in the portfolio was considered high risk as defined by banking regulations 
we increased the investment in mortgage backed securities to provide a dependable source of principal and interest cash flow from the monthly amortization of these securities that could be reinvested at higher rates should market rates increase 
the decline in the duration of the portfolio indicates our continuing efforts to structure the portfolio for a higher interest rate environment 
the shorter duration should make the market value of the portfolio less volatile and thereby limit the expected market value depreciation in a higher rate environment

allowance for loan losses the allowance for loan losses table is established and maintained at a level that we believe is adequate to absorb estimated losses in the bank s loan portfolio based upon a periodic evaluation of current information of the risks inherent in the portfolio and is monitored with continuous internal as well as semiannual independent loan reviews 
there are many elements that we evaluate to determine the adequacy of the allowance for loan losses 
the bank has an internal rating system that assigns grades for all loans except residential mortgage loans  consumer loans and commercial and commercial real estate loans under  loans are initially assigned to one of seven risk grades 
the loan officer assigns the loan rating at the time the loan is made 
these ratings may be changed over time to reflect changes in the financial condition of the borrowing entity 
if warranted  the risk rating may be lowered to eight substandard  nine doubtful or ten loss 
loans rated ten are charged off 
all loans rated seven through nine  which are considered watch loans  are assigned either a specific allowance allocation or a general allowance allocation percentage 
the specific allowance allocation is based on an analysis of each loan for which a specific allowance allocation is assigned 
general allowance allocation percentages assigned to watch loans are based upon a three year average historical loss experience for that particular risk rating 
general allowance allocation percentages are also assigned to commercial and commercial mortgage loans not on the watch loan list  for consumer loans  residential mortgage loans  letters of credit and loan commitments 
the general allowance pennrock financial services corp 
allocation percentage assigned to categories of non watch loans are based on the three year average historical loss experience for each category of loan  letter of credit or commitment 
the sum of all allowance amounts determined by this methodology is utilized as the primary indicator of the appropriate level of the allowance for loan losses 
we may increase the allowance for loan losses to an amount higher than that computed above in response to factors and conditions that may not be fully reflected in the determination of the allowance allocation percentages 
these factors and conditions may not be adequately captured in the historical loss component and is an assessment of information delay and its impact on the timeliness of the risk rating process 
these factors and conditions include i 
general economic and business conditions affecting our key lending areas  ii 
credit quality trends including trends in non performing loans expected to result from existing economic conditions  iii 
trends that could affect collateral values  iv 
loan volumes and concentrations  v 
seasoning of the loan portfolio  vi 
specific industry conditions affecting portfolio segments  vii 
duration of the current business cycle  viii 
bank regulatory examination results  and ix 
the results of our internal loan review process 
in addition to the internal grading system analysis  we compare the bank s allowance for loan losses as a percentage of total loans to the peer group average percentage as shown in the most recently available ubpr 
when we assign loan ratings to individual loans  we consider the risk elements attributable to particular loan types or categories 
these risk elements may include i 
for non farm and non residential loans  multifamily residential loans and agricultural real estate loans  the debt service coverage ratio income from the property in excess of operating expenses compared to loan payment requirements  ii 
for construction and land development loans  the perceived feasibility of the project including the ability to sell developed lots or improvements constructed for resale or ability to lease property constructed for lease  experience and ability of the developer and loan to value ratios  iii 
for commercial and commercial real estate loans  the operating results of the commercial  industrial or professional enterprise  the specific risks and volatility of income and operating results typical for similar businesses and the value  nature and marketability of collateral  iv 
for non real estate agricultural loans  the operating results  experience and ability of the borrower  historical and expected market conditions and the value  nature and marketability of the collateral 
in addition  for each category  we consider secondary sources of income and the financial strength of the borrower and any guarantors 
the board of directors reviews the allowance on a quarterly basis to determine whether the amount of monthly provision is adequate or whether additional provisions should be made to the allowance 
the internally classified watch list  along with the list of non accrual and non performing loans  helps the board and management assess the overall quality of the loan portfolio and the adequacy of the allowance 
loans classified as an eight substandard are loans with clear and defined weaknesses such as highly leveraged positions  unfavorable financial ratios  uncertain repayment sources or poor financial condition which may jeopardize recoverability of the loan 
loans classified as a nine doubtful are those loans that have characteristics similar to substandard loans  but also have an increased risk that a loss may occur or at least a portion of the loan may require a charge off if liquidated 
both eight and nine rated loans categories may include loans that are past due at least days  are on non accrual status or have been restructured 
as of december   there were no loans rated nine or ten

liquidity the purpose of liquidity management is to ensure that there are sufficient cash flows available to meet a variety of needs while minimizing the cost of funds and maximizing yields on liquid assets 
these needs include financial commitments such as satisfying the credit needs of our borrowers and withdrawals by our depositors  the ability to capitalize on investment and business opportunities as they occur  and the funding of pennrock s own operations 
liquidity is measured by pennrock s ability to convert assets to cash at a reasonable cost or a minimum loss 
we achieve these objectives through the implementation of our asset liability policy

loan repayments are a relatively stable source of funds  but such loans generally are not readily convertible to cash and are subject to risks associated with borrower s ability to pay that may be impacted by national and local economic conditions 
accordingly  pennrock may be required from time to time to rely on secondary sources of liquidity to meet loan and withdrawal demands or otherwise fund operations 
such sources include fhlb advances  federal funds lines of credit from correspondent banks and federal reserve bank borrowings 
pennrock financial services corp 
the bank may borrow funds from the fhlb of pittsburgh and from other sources 
the fhlb system acts as an additional source of funding for financial institutions 
in addition  the bank uses federal funds lines and securities sold under agreements to repurchase as funding sources 
in order to utilize the services of the fhlb  the bank is required to own stock in the fhlb 
the amount of stock held by the bank varies with the total amount of advances the bank has outstanding at any point in time 
as of december   the bank held million in stock of the fhlb 
the fhlb uses various factors to determine the amount of credit to extend to a financial institution 
these factors include i 
total regulatory capital  ii 
net income  iii 
the quality and composition of assets  iv 
lending policies and practices  v 
the level of current borrowings from all sources  and vi

securities sold under agreements to repurchase repurchase agreements are another source of borrowed funds 
under this type of borrowing  securities are pledged against borrowed funds and are released when the funds are repaid 
the bank uses this type of short term borrowing alternative on an overnight basis 
the repurchase agreements with customers are part of a cash management account arrangement the bank maintains with certain of its larger corporate customers 
short term borrowings decreased from million as of december  to million as of december  of the repurchase agreements outstanding at year end  million were with bank customers while million were outstanding at the fhlb

all of the long term advances are convertible advances that permit the fhlb to convert the advance from a fixed rate to a variable rate at its discretion on a specified call date following an initial lock out period ranging from one year to five years 
some of the long term advances further restrict the fhlb s ability to call the advance unless month libor is at or above a specified rate

 goodwill and other intangible assets 
sfas no 
addresses the recognition and measurement of goodwill and other intangible assets subsequent to acquisition 
under this standard  goodwill is no longer amortized 
instead  it is tested for impairment at least annually 
pennrock adopted the provisions of sfas no 
on january  the adoption of sfas no 
eliminates annual goodwill amortization of approximately  per year 
we tested goodwill for impairment as of june  based on this test  we concluded that there was no impairment 
goodwill totaled million as of december  which includes reclassified goodwill of  that had previously been classified as an unidentified intangible and excluded from the provisions of sfas no

which defines extraordinary items as events and transactions that are distinguished by their unusual nature and by the infrequency of their occurrence 
sfas no 
eliminates statement no 
and by doing so eliminates the exception to applying apb no 
to all gains and losses related to extinguishments of debt other than extinguishment of debt to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
as a result  gains and losses from extinguishment of debt should be classified as extraordinary items only if they meet the criteria in apb no 
applying apb no 
will distinguish transactions that are part of an entity s recurring operations from those that are unusual or infrequent in nature or that meet the criteria for classification as an extraordinary item 
the provisions of sfas no 
related to the rescission of statement no

fasb interpretation no 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
  and and rescission of fasb interpretation no 
this interpretation elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
this interpretation also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  due to the prospective application of this interpretation  the impact on pennrock s financial statements has not been determined

prior to sfas no 
 the intangibles arising from a branch acquisition were accounted for in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for certain acquisitions of bank and thrift institutions 
certain of these intangibles may have been identified as core deposit intangibles cdis 
cdis are amortized over the estimated average life of the deposit base acquired 
cdis will continue to be subject to the provisions of sfas no 
and will continue to be amortized 
other intangibles may not have been identified or may be in excess of the established cdi 
these intangibles were designated unidentified intangibles 
if the branch acquisition was considered a business combination  the unamortized balance of these unidentified intangibles are to be reclassified as goodwill and accounted for and reported prospectively under the provisions of sfas no 
under sfas no 
 this reclassified goodwill will be evaluated for impairment but will no longer be amortized 
pennrock adopted the provisions of sfas no 
during the fourth quarter of subsequent to the adoption of sfas no

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
this statement amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change from the intrinsic value method to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  this statement amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no

pennrock financial services corp 
under sfas no 
 an entity electing to convert from the intrinsic value method of apb opinion  accounting for stock issued to employees can choose among three approaches i 
full prospective approach sfas no 
is applied to employee awards granted  modified or settled after the beginning of the year in which sfas no 
is first adopted 
the prospective method was the only method originally permitted by sfas no 
ii 
the modified prospective approach stock based employee compensation cost is recognized from the beginning of the fiscal year in which sfas no 
is first applied as if the fair value method had been employed to account for awards granted  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  iii 
the retroactive restatement method all periods presented are restated to reflect the fair value method for employee awards granted  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  restatement of periods before those that are presented is allowed but not required 
sfas no 
requires the following disclosures to be presented in the summary of significant accounting policies in the notes to consolidated financial statements i 
the method used to account for stock based employee compensation the intrinsic value method or the fair value method  ii 
when an entity switches from the fair value method  a description of the approach for reporting the change  iii 
if unvested awards were outstanding and accounted for under the intrinsic value method for any period in which an income statement is presented  the following information must be disclosed in tabular form a 
net income  basic and diluted earnings per share as reported  b 
the amount of stock based employee compensation cost  net of tax effect  as reported  c 
the amount of stock based employee compensation cost  net of tax effect  that would have been included in the determination of net income if the fair value method had been applied to all awards granted  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december   d 
pro forma net income and basic and diluted earnings per share as if the fair value method had been applied to all awards granted  modified or settled in fiscal years beginning after december  iv 
for entities electing the retroactive restatement approach  both the amounts of the transition adjustment and of the effects of restatement should be disclosed in the year in which sfas no 
is first adopted 
sfas no 
has also amended apb opinion  interim financial reporting to require that public companies provide a tabular presentation similar to that called for in annual statements in condensed quarterly statements if  for any period presented  the intrinsic value method is used

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk pennrock s financial performance is impacted by  among other factors  interest rate risk and credit risk 
we manage credit risk by relying on strict credit standards  loan review and adequate loan loss reserves 
interest rate risk refers to pennrock s degree of exposure to loss of earnings resulting from changes in market interest rates 
as a financial intermediary  pennrock invests in various types of interest earning assets primarily loans and securities that are funded largely by interest bearing liabilities primarily deposits and fhlb advances 
such financial instruments have varying levels of sensitivity to changes in market interest rates 
the disparity of sensitivity between financial assets and liabilities creates interest rate risk for pennrock 
the magnitude of this exposure depends on the severity and timing of the market rate changes and on our ability to adjust the composition of the balance sheet in reaction to those changes 
pennrock s asset liability management committee the alco addresses this risk 
the bank s senior management team comprises the alco 
the alco monitors interest rate risk by modeling the estimated net interest income and net income under various interest rate scenarios 
the alco attempts to manage the various components of pennrock s balance sheet to minimize the impact of sudden and sustained changes in interest rates on net interest income and net income 
however  the alco may sometimes structure the balance sheet to take advantage of expected interest rate movements 
pennrock financial services corp 
pennrock s exposure to interest rate risk is reviewed on a monthly basis by the board of directors and the alco 
interest rate risk exposure is measured using interest rate sensitivity analysis to determine pennrock s change in net interest income and net income in the event of hypothetical changes in interest rates 
if the potential changes to net interest income and net income resulting from hypothetical interest rate swings are not within the exposure limits established by the board  the board may direct management to adjust its asset and liability mix to bring interest rate risk within board approved limits 
pennrock s net interest income  the most significant component of its net income  is impacted by changes in market interest rates and yield curves  particularly if there are differences  or gaps  in the repricing frequencies of its interest earning assets and the interest bearing liabilities which fund them 
the alco monitors such interest rate gaps and seeks to manage interest rate risk by adjusting the repricing frequencies of its interest earning assets and interest bearing liabilities 
if more assets than liabilities mature or reprice within a given time frame  pennrock is asset sensitive 
if more liabilities mature or reprice during the time frame  pennrock is liability sensitive 
an asset sensitive gap will generally benefit pennrock in a period of rising rates while a liability sensitive gap will generally benefit pennrock during declining rates 
gap analysis has certain limitations 
for example  although certain assets and liabilities may have similar maturities or periods to repricing  they may react in different degrees to changes in market interest rates 
some types of financial instruments are very sensitive to changes in market rates while others may lag behind such changes 
certain assets such as adjustable rate loans have limits on the amount of change in interest rates allowed in the short term periodic caps and over the life of the loan lifetime caps 
further  changes in interest rates may change the characteristics of certain financial instruments and cause them to react differently than expected due to imbedded options 
for example  a decrease in market rates could trigger the option that allows mortgage customers to refinance their mortgages while an increase in market rates may induce customers to exercise their option to redeem their certificates of deposit prior to maturity 
these and other changes would likely cause actual results to deviate significantly from the assumptions used in calculating changes in net interest income or net income 
while alco continuously monitors and adjusts the gap position to maximize profitability  the primary objective is to maintain net interest income and net income within self imposed parameters for a wide range of possible changes in interest rates 
the following table presents an interest sensitivity analysis of pennrock s assets and liabilities as of december  all interest rates are on a tax equivalent basis 
pennrock financial services corp 
table interest sensitivity analysis in thousands december  interest sensitivity period more than more than more than less than months to months year to more than months months to year years years total earning assets short term investments   weighted average interest rate mortgages held for sale   weighted average interest rate securities available for sale       weighted average interest rate loans       weighted average interest rate total interest earning assets       interest bearing liabilities interest bearing demand deposits      weighted average interest rate savings deposits     weighted average interest rate time deposits      weighted average interest rate short term borrowings   weighted average interest rate long term debt    weighted average interest rate total interest bearing liabilities       interest sensitivity gap period      cumulative      interest sensitive assets to interest sensitive liabilities ratio period cumulative assumes now account balances are withdrawn at per year 
assumes savings balances are withdrawn at per year 
this analysis indicates that pennrock is asset sensitive over all time frames 
this means that pennrock s balance sheet should be well positioned for rising interest rates 
if  however  alco is concerned that rates may fall within the next year and that a drop in market rates would reduce net interest income and net income  it can take action to reduce the asset sensitivity of the balance sheet such as by purchasing fixed rate securities and funding such purchases with short term borrowings 
pennrock financial services corp 
while the preceding table helps provide some information about pennrock s interest sensitivity within one year  it is not reliable in predicting the trends of future earnings in the longer term 
for this reason  we use financial modeling to forecast earnings under different interest rate projections 
pennrock s board of directors has adopted an interest rate risk policy which establishes a maximum decrease in the net interest income and net income in the event of a sudden and sustained increase or decrease in market interest rates of percentage points 
the following tables present the bank s projected change in net interest income and net income for and percentage point rate shocks as of december  and the board s established limit 
the impact on net interest income and net income relate to the bank only 
the assets and liabilities of the parent company only or for national and pcs are not considered in this analysis and their corresponding earnings at risk do not have a significant effect on this analysis 
table changes in net interest income in thousands net interest percent board change in interest rates income computed change change limit percentage point rise   percentage point rise   base rate scenario  percentage point decline   percentage point decline   table changes in net income in thousands net interest percent board change in interest rates income computed change change limit percentage point rise   percentage point rise   base rate scenario  percentage point decline   percentage point decline   the preceding tables indicate that as of december   in the event of a sudden and sustained decrease in prevailing market interest rates  both pennrock s net interest income and net income would be expected to decrease million and million respectively 
however  if market rates increased by percentage points  net interest income and net income would be expected to increase 
this simulation analysis agrees with table gap analysis that indicates that pennrock is asset sensitive 
pennrock s interest income and net income increase if rates rise and decline if rates fall 
at december   pennrock s estimated changes in net interest income and net income are within policy limits 
computation of forecasted effects of hypothetical interest rate changes are based on numerous assumptions 
these include loan and mortgage backed security prepayment rates  calls of callable securities  conversions of fixed rate fhlb advances to adjustable advances  and rates of deposit decay  and should not be relied upon as indicative of actual future results 
even minor changes in these assumptions may significantly alter the results of the model 
further  the computations do not contemplate any actions the alco could take to mitigate any negative effects of changes in interest rates as discussed above
