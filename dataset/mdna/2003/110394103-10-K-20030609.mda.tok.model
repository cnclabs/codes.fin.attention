item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations should be read in conjunction with forward looking statements  risk factors and our consolidated financial statements for the fiscal years ended march   march  and march   and the related notes thereto  included elsewhere in this annual report 
general we are a leading provider of helicopter transportation services to the worldwide offshore oil and gas industry with major operations in the gulf of mexico and the north sea 
we also have operations  both directly and indirectly  in most of the other major offshore oil and gas producing regions of the world  including australia  brazil  china  mexico  nigeria and trinidad 
additionally  we are a leading provider of production management services for oil and gas production facilities in the gulf of mexico 
as of march   we operated aircraft and our unconsolidated affiliates operated an additional aircraft throughout the world 
we operate our business in two segments helicopter activities and production management services 
we conduct our helicopter activities through the following four business units north american operations  north sea operations  international operations  and technical services 
in our previous public disclosures  we have referred to our north american operations as air log and to our north sea operations as bristow 
in fiscal  we began to report technical services as a separate business unit within our helicopter activities segment when we expanded these operations through our acquisition of an aircraft engine and component overhaul company 
as a result of the acquisition  we now provide certain engine repair and overhaul services to third parties as well as for our own operations  in addition to other helicopter engineering  refurbishment and repair services 
the acquired company was formerly affiliated with a group of entities that are investors in hc  our unconsolidated affiliate in mexico 
for additional information about this acquisition  see note i in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
in fiscal  our north american operations  north sea operations  international operations and technical services contributed   and  respectively  of our operating revenue 
while operating revenue from all of the business units within our helicopter activities segment has increased over the past three fiscal years 
we expect that the percentage of our overall revenue derived from our international operations will continue to increase as the major oil and gas companies continue to focus their operations in these regions 
our production management services segment contributed the remaining of our operating revenue in fiscal operating revenue from this segment in fiscal increased from fiscal primarily due to the addition of a contract with a major customer 
our operating revenue depends on the demand for our services and the pricing terms of our contracts 
we measure the demand for our helicopter services in flight hours 
demand for our services depends on the level of worldwide offshore oil and gas exploration  development and production activities 
our customers exploration and development activities are influenced by actual and expected trends in commodity prices for oil and gas 
exploration and development activities generally use medium size and larger aircraft on which we typically earn higher margins 
production related activities are less sensitive to variances in commodity prices  and accordingly provide a more stable activity base for our flight operations 
we estimate that a majority of our operating revenue from helicopter activities is related to the production activities of the oil and gas companies 
additionally  our production management services are less affected by downturns in the offshore oil and gas industry because we are able to scale our operations in response to market conditions 

table of contents we generate additional revenue  which we refer to as corporate revenue  from intercompany leases of aircraft within our helicopter activities segment 
this revenue is eliminated in consolidation 
drilling related activities affect the demand for our crew change services 
during fiscal  the number of drilling rigs in the gulf of mexico averaged per month compared to per month during fiscal as a result  demand for our crew change services in our north american operations decreased significantly during fiscal until the drilling activity in the gulf of mexico increases  we expect that demand for our crew change services in our north american operations will not increase 
during april  the uk government instituted a progressive tax regime which directly impacts oil and gas production and exploration in the north sea 
several oil companies have stated that the new tax regime is a deterrent to future capital spending 
should the oil companies significantly reduce their exploration and development budgets as a result of this tax change  demand for our services could be negatively impacted 
our helicopter contracts are generally based on a two tier rate structure consisting of a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
we also provide services to customers on an ad hoc basis  which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter duration 
our charges for ad hoc services are generally based on an hourly rate  or a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
we estimate that our ad hoc services have a higher margin than our other helicopter contracts due to supply and demand dynamics 
our rate structure is based on fuel costs remaining at or below a predetermined threshold 
fuel costs in excess of this threshold are charged to the customer 
our helicopter contracts are for varying periods and generally permit the customer to cancel the charter before the end of the contract term 
in our north american operations  we typically enter into short term contracts for months or less 
in our north sea operations  contracts are longer term  generally between two and five years 
we have one seven year contract in the north sea with a major international oil company 
in our international operations  contract length generally ranges from three to five years 
at the expiration of a contract  our customers typically negotiate renewal terms with us for the next contract period 
sometimes customers solicit new bids at the expiration of a contract 
contracts are generally awarded based on a number of factors  including price  quality of service  equipment and record of safety 
an incumbent operator has a competitive advantage in the bidding process based on its relationship with the customer  its knowledge of the site characteristics and its understanding of the cost structure for the operations 
maintenance and repair expenses  training costs  employee wages and insurance premiums represent a significant portion of our overall expenses 
our production management costs also include contracted transportation services 
our consolidated operating expenses increased in fiscal due primarily to wage increases for pilots  mechanics and other employees and higher insurance premiums 
we expense maintenance and repair costs  including major aircraft component overhaul costs  as the costs are incurred 
certain major aircraft components  primarily engines and transmissions  are maintained by third party vendors under contractual arrangements 
the maintenance costs related to these contractual arrangements are recorded ratably as the components are used to generate flight revenue 
as a result  our earnings in any given period are directly impacted by the amount of our maintenance and repair expenses for that period 
in addition to our variable operating expenses  we incur fixed charges for depreciation of our property and equipment 
for accounting purposes  we depreciate our helicopters on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives to an estimated residual value of to of their original cost 
we generally estimate the life of a helicopter to be seven  or years depending on its size and condition 
we estimate the residual value of our helicopters based on the type of the aircraft 
we only own of the common stock of bristow  but we own of bristow s subordinated debt 
in addition  we have a put call agreement with the other two owners of bristow which grants us the right to buy all of their shares of bristow common stock and grants to each of them the right to require us to buy their shares 
the per share price in any such sale would be equal to its par value plus accrued interest 
under uk law  to maintain bristow s operating license  we would be required to find a qualified european owner to acquire any of the bristow shares that we have the right or obligation to acquire under the agreement 
as a result of our ownership and contractual arrangements  we consolidate the results of bristow and its subsidiaries 
for additional information about bristow  see note a and note j in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 

table of contents as a result of local laws limiting foreign ownership of aviation companies  we conduct helicopter activities in many foreign countries through interests in unconsolidated affiliates 
in some cases  we realize revenue from these foreign operations by leasing aircraft and services and technical support to those entities 
we also receive dividend income from the earnings of some of these entities 
we report lease revenue as operating revenue and dividend income as part of earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  as the results of these foreign operations are not included in our revenue or operating income 
for additional information about these unconsolidated affiliates  see note c in the notes to consolidated financial statements included elsewhere in this annual report 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us in many cases  the accounting treatment of a particular transaction is specifically dictated by generally accepted accounting principles  whereas  in other circumstances  we are required to make estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon information available 
we base our estimates and judgments on historical experience and various other factors that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  as discussed in the notes to our consolidated financial statements  the following involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
income taxes 
we recognize foreign tax credits available to us to offset the us income taxes due on income earned from foreign sources 
these credits are limited by the total income tax on the us income tax return as well as by the ratio of foreign source income in each statutory category to total income 
in estimating the amount of foreign tax credits that are realizable  we estimate future taxable income in each statutory category 
these estimates are subject to change based on changes in the market condition in each statutory category and the timing of certain deductions available to us in each statutory category 
we periodically reassess these estimates and record changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits based on these revised estimates 
changes to the amount of realizable foreign tax credits can be significant given any material change to our estimates on which the realizability of foreign tax credits is based 
impairment of long lived assets 
we review long lived assets for impairment at least annually  or more frequently whenever events occur or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of assets may not be recoverable 
we measure recoverability of assets by comparing the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from these assets throughout their estimated useful lives to the carrying amount of the asset 
if the sum of the expected future cash flows is less than the carrying amount of the asset  we would be required to recognize an impairment loss 
when determining fair value  we utilize various assumptions  including projections of future cash flows 
a change in these underlying assumptions will cause a change in the results of the tests and  as such  could cause fair value to be less than the carrying amounts 
in such event  we would then be required to record a corresponding charge  which would reduce our earnings 
we continue to evaluate our estimates and assumptions and believe that our assumptions  which include an estimate of future cash flows based upon the anticipated performance of the underlying business units  are appropriate 
revenue recognition 
revenue from charters of helicopters are recognized as performed based on contractual charter rates 
the helicopter charters are for varying periods and generally permit the customer to cancel the charter before the end of the contract term 
the charges under these charter contracts are generally based on either a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
additionally  we also provide services to customers on a basis we refer to as ad hoc  which usually entails a shorter notice period and shorter duration 
our charges for ad hoc services are generally based on either an hourly rate  or a daily or monthly fixed fee plus additional fees for each hour flown 
our rate structure is based on fuel costs remaining at or below a predetermined threshold 
fuel costs in excess of this threshold are charged to the customer 
revenue from production management services is recognized as these services are performed 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we routinely review our accounts receivable balances and make adequate provisions for doubtful accounts based on historical experience  our customers financial strength and other information 
if our evaluation of our customers creditworthiness changes or is incorrect  we may have to adjust the allowance for our receivables 
inventory reserve 
we maintain inventory that primarily consists of spare parts to service our aircraft 
we periodically review the condition and continuing usefulness of the parts to determine the adequacy of the valuation reserve 
if our valuation of these parts is significantly different from the realizable value of the parts  an additional provision may be required 

table of contents insurance 
we are self insured for our group medical insurance program and must make estimates to record the expenses related to this program 
we also have deductibles on our workers compensation program and estimate the expenses related to the retained portion of that risk 
if actual experience under any of our insurance programs is significantly different from our estimates  we may have to record charges to income when we identify the risk of additional loss 
conversely  if actual costs are lower than our estimates or return premiums are larger than originally projected  then we may have to record credits to income when we identify the excess return premiums

our fiscal consolidated operating expenses increased to million  or  from million in fiscal this increase in operating expenses was due primarily to higher labor and insurance costs and had the effect of lowering our operating margin to from in the prior fiscal year 
as a result  operating income for fiscal decreased to million as compared to million for fiscal our fiscal net income was million  representing a decrease from fiscal this decrease primarily resulted from our reduced operating income  which was partially offset by a million increase in earnings from unconsolidated affiliates primarily due to dividends from our unconsolidated affiliate in egypt 
set forth below is a discussion of the results of our segments and business units 
helicopter activities operating revenue from helicopter activities increased to million  or  during fiscal  with operating expenses increasing by to million 
this led to an operating margin of in fiscal as compared to in fiscal helicopter activities results are further explained below by business unit 

table of contents north american operations 
operating revenue from our north american operations decreased in fiscal to million  or  from the prior fiscal year primarily as a result of a decrease in flight activity from the prior fiscal year 
operating revenue declined less rapidly than flight hours due primarily to the full fiscal year effect of the rate increase that was phased in beginning in june flight hours and operating revenue generated from larger  crew change aircraft in the gulf of mexico decreased and  respectively  from the prior year due to the decrease in drilling activity in the gulf of mexico during fiscal by contrast  flight hours and operating revenue from smaller  production related aircraft decreased and  respectively 
in addition flight hours and revenue from our north american operations declined due to unusually poor weather conditions in the gulf of mexico during the fourth quarter and to the termination by a large customer of its helicopter contract 
during fiscal  this customer had aircraft on full time monthly contract  including two crew change aircraft and eight smaller aircraft and accounted for approximately million of revenue for our north american operations 
in fiscal  through the termination of its contract  this customer accounted for approximately million in revenue for our north american operations 
monthly contracts with other customers were added during fiscal partially mitigating the impact of this lost work 
our operating margin in our north american operations of for fiscal decreased from in the prior fiscal year 
the decrease in operating margin was primarily a result of lower revenue as discussed above and wage increases for pilots  mechanics and other operational employees in response to increases in the market wages for these employee groups 
insurance costs also increased substantially 
higher depreciation costs as a result of aircraft purchased in the prior fiscal year also contributed to the decline in the operating margin 
north sea operations 
operating revenue from our north sea operations increased in fiscal to million  or  from fiscal revenue of million 
excluding foreign exchange effects  fiscal revenue from these operations increased from fiscal revenue 
the increase in operating revenue primarily resulted from rate increases on customer contracts both at mid term and upon renewal  and a favorable change in the mix of aircraft operated in fiscal flight hours for the current fiscal year decreased by 
on july   one of our s helicopters  while ferrying passengers for a customer  crashed in the southern sector of the north sea 
as a result of the accident  the customer immediately grounded the six s helicopters it had under contract with us 
this grounding was lifted by the customer for two aircraft on august  and in early september for the remaining four aircraft 
we covered the customer s requirements by using a different aircraft type 
accordingly  flight hours were impacted  but not significantly  by the accident 
operating expenses from our north sea operations increased to million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase in operating expenses was primarily the result of higher employee wages and an increase in insurance costs 
in addition  we incurred approximately million in uninsured costs as a result of the north sea accident 
these costs primarily related to the retiring of main rotor blades that had a similar history to the one that was involved in the accident 
the operating margin in our north sea operations increased to in fiscal from in fiscal during november  we sold assets related to our activities in italy 
we recognized a pre tax loss on the disposal of these assets during fiscal of million  which is recorded in the gain on disposal of assets in our accompanying consolidated statements of income 
these assets generated approximately million of operating revenue for our north sea operations for fiscal and million for fiscal the loss represents the excess of book value over sales proceeds  plus the accrual of certain obligations totaling million which have been reflected in our march  consolidated balance sheet 
additionally  we expect to consummate the sale of three additional aircraft based in italy 
these aircraft are currently leased by us from a third party and subleased to the buyer 
the sales of the aircraft are contingent upon our exercising purchase options under the leases and the closing of the sale to the buyer 
gains resulting from these aircraft sales are expected to be approximately million 
international operations 
operating revenue from international operations increased in fiscal to million  or  from million in fiscal  primarily as a result of a increase in flight activity from the prior fiscal year 
these increases were primarily attributable to the expansion of our operations in nigeria  through the acquisition of additional aircraft in july  and an increased level of oil and gas activity in mexico and trinidad which resulted in increased demand for our services 

table of contents in mexico  flight activity and operating revenue for fiscal increased over the prior fiscal year levels by and  respectively 
the increase in flight activity and operating revenue were primarily due to additional work that we performed for a major customer 
three aircraft were transferred to mexico in the first half of calendar as a result of this demand 
the operating revenue generated from these three aircraft accounted for approximately of the increase in revenue in mexico for fiscal in nigeria  operating revenue was up by and flight activity increased for fiscal over the prior fiscal year 
on july   we purchased a controlling interest in a west africa helicopter operating company  ten single engine helicopters and three fixed wing aircraft for million 
the acquisition was financed with million of our existing cash and borrowings of million under our us credit facility 
in connection with the acquisition  we began to provide services to a major oil company under a five year contract 
excluding the flight activity and revenue relating to this contract  flight activity and revenue in nigeria decreased for the current fiscal year by and  respectively  over the prior fiscal year 
the disproportionate decrease in flight activity and operating revenue is primarily due to a change in the structure of one contract whereby the customer now provides its own aircraft and we provide the crew  maintenance and technical support needed to operate the aircraft 
additionally  the completion of a contract and a decrease in ad hoc work during the current fiscal year had a negative impact on flight activity and revenue 
in trinidad  operating revenue and flight activity for fiscal increased by and  respectively  over the prior fiscal year 
the increase in flight activity was primarily due to a short term contract in fiscal and increased drilling activity 
operating revenue for fiscal was also favorably impacted by the full fiscal year effect of a rate increase that became effective october  operating expenses for our international operations increased in fiscal to million  or  from million in fiscal this increase was primarily a result of higher salary costs  maintenance costs and lease fees due to increased operations in our international areas 
the operating margin in our international operations decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal technical services 
operating revenue for technical services increased during fiscal to million  or  compared to million in the prior fiscal year  primarily as a result of the expansion of these operations in december when we acquired an engine repair and overhaul facility that enabled us to provide these services to third parties 
operating expenses for technical services increased in fiscal to million  or  from million in fiscal the increase in operating expenses was due largely to the expansion of our operations discussed above  salary increases and additional material cost associated with an increase in projects 
operating margin for technical services for fiscal increased to from in the prior fiscal year 
production management services operating revenue from our production management services segment increased to million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal  primarily due to the addition of a contract with a major customer in january operating expenses in this segment increased to million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal due to higher transportation charges offset by a reduction in goodwill amortization expense of million due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets on april  our operating margin improved to from in fiscal general and administrative costs consolidated general and administrative costs increased by million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in professional fees and higher salary expenses 
professional fees in fiscal included legal fees incurred in connection with our listing on the new york stock exchange and new corporate governance legislation  and fees for various consulting services 
earnings from unconsolidated affiliates earnings from unconsolidated affiliates increased in fiscal by million primarily due to an increase in dividends received from investments accounted for under the cost method of accounting 
the increase was primarily due to dividends from our unconsolidated affiliate in egypt 

table of contents other income expense other expense  net for fiscal was million compared to other income  net  of million in fiscal the expense in fiscal was primarily the result of foreign currency exchange losses 
fiscal compared to fiscal consolidated results during fiscal  our consolidated revenue increased to million  or  from million in fiscal the increase in revenue was due primarily to rate increases in both our north american and north sea operations  which also resulted in an increase in operating margin to in fiscal from in fiscal fiscal consolidated expenses increased to million  or  from million in fiscal helicopter activities operating revenue from helicopter activities increased in fiscal to million  or  from million in fiscal  with operating expenses increasing by only to million 
this led to an operating margin of in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the improvement in margin resulted from increased revenue due primarily from rate increases in both our north american and north sea operations 
segment results are discussed below in further detail by business unit 
north american operations 
operating revenue from our north american operations for fiscal improved to million  representing an increase of over the prior fiscal year primarily due to a increase in flight activity and rate increases averaging and which went into effect in january and june  respectively 
flight hours and revenue generated from larger  crew change aircraft in the gulf of mexico increased by and  respectively  from the prior year  while flight hours and revenue from smaller  production related aircraft increased by and  respectively 
the increase in activity from the smaller  production related aircraft was a result of our focus on production related contract opportunities 
the rate increase of in june was the largest in our year history 
these rates became effective for all contracts and were phased in over several months 
a portion of the rate increase was needed to cover additional salary costs 
in light of salary increases announced by our competitors and the shrinking pool of qualified personnel  we increased our wage rates effective july   for pilots  mechanics and other operational employees in our north american operations 
as a result  we incurred an additional million in salary costs for fiscal our operating margin for our north american operations in fiscal compared to for fiscal during september  our north american fleet was grounded for three days as a result of the faa s closure of us airspace 
this grounding occurred on the three peak flying days of the week and management estimates that we lost approximately  hours of flight time as a result 
we received approximately million in january from the department of transportation as partial reimbursement for the revenue lost due to the grounding 
as of march   the drilling rig utilization in the gulf of mexico was  down from at march  consequently  our crew change services and the market for ad hoc work had diminished 
north sea operations 
operating revenue from our north sea operations increased in fiscal to million  or  from million in fiscal flight activity in fiscal decreased  however  by from fiscal the net decrease in flight activity resulted from increased activity in our north sea markets which was more than offset by a decrease in flight activity as a result of our deconsolidation of the results of our norwegian affiliate as discussed below 
the increase in operating revenue from north sea operations resulted from an increase in oil industry activity as well as rate increases on customer contracts both at mid term and upon renewal 
additionally  the tightening of the supply of helicopters in the north sea resulted in premium rates being charged for ad hoc flights 

table of contents the decrease in operating revenue from norway was the result of an accounting change during fiscal  whereby the results of our norwegian affiliate are no longer consolidated in our financial statements 
since then  the affiliate has instead been treated as an unconsolidated affiliate 
see notes a and c in the notes to consolidated financial statements for a further discussion 
if we had continued to consolidate the affiliate throughout fiscal  our flight revenue would have increased by from the prior fiscal year 
operating expenses from our north sea operations decreased to million in fiscal  or  from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily the result of the deconsolidation of the norwegian affiliate discussed above 
fiscal costs included million in salary adjustments resulting from our negotiations with the two unions representing our north sea workforce 
the operating margin in our north sea operations improved to in fiscal from in fiscal international operations 
operating revenue and flight hours in our international operations increased in fiscal by and  respectively  from fiscal  primarily as a result of an increase in activity in nigeria and trinidad 
in nigeria  revenue and flight activity were up and  respectively  from fiscal due to the further development of deep water projects 
operating revenue and flight activity in trinidad increased by and  respectively  from fiscal due to additional drilling and a rate increase effective october technical services 
operating revenue for technical services decreased to million  or  in fiscal from million in fiscal operating expenses for technical services decreased in fiscal to million  or  from million in fiscal the decrease in operating expenses was primarily a result of fewer projects being performed for customers 
the operating margin for fiscal decreased to from in the prior fiscal year 
production management services operating revenue for our production management services segment decreased in fiscal to million  or  from million in fiscal  primarily due to the loss of a contract with a major customer in may operating expenses in this segment decreased to million in fiscal  or  from million in fiscal this segment s fiscal operating margin of was below the comparable in fiscal primarily as the result of an increase in insurance costs in fiscal general and administrative costs consolidated general and administrative costs increased by million in fiscal primarily due to an increase in operating activity in fiscal earnings from unconsolidated affiliates earnings from unconsolidated affiliates  net increased in fiscal by million primarily due to increases in earnings from equity investments accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
other income expense other income  net  for fiscal was million compared to other income  net of million in fiscal the increase in income in fiscal was the result of foreign currency exchange gains and losses 
liquidity and capital resources during fiscal  our primary source of funds to meet working capital needs  service debt and fund capital expenditures was cash from operations 
we believe that our future cash flow from operations  available lines of credit and other available financing will be sufficient to meet our working capital  capital expenditure and debt service needs in the foreseeable future 

table of contents operating activities cash and cash equivalents were million  million and million as of march   and  respectively 
working capital as of march   and was million  million and million  respectively 
the decrease in working capital in fiscal was due primarily to the classification of the million outstanding principal amount of the convertible subordinated notes due in december in current maturities of long term debt 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal and million in fiscal the decrease in cash flows provided by operating activities in fiscal was primarily the result of decreases in accrued liabilities and other payables 
the increase in cash flows in fiscal from fiscal was a result of improved earnings in fiscal investing activities cash flows used in investing activities were million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively

the variance between the federal statutory rate and the effective rate for these periods is due primarily to non taxable foreign source income available to reduce us taxable income 
our effective tax rate is impacted by the amount of our foreign source income and our ability to realize foreign tax credits 
pension liability as of march   we had recorded on our balance sheet a million pension liability related to the bristow pension plan 
the liability represented the excess of the present value of the defined benefit pension plan liabilities over the fair value of plan assets that existed at that date 
since that measurement date  the value of plan assets has declined and our projected benefit obligation has increased 
plan assets are primarily approximately invested in equity securities  of which approximately are concentrated in uk companies 
since march   the ftse index has decreased by approximately 
since march   market interest rates have declined and therefore the present value of projected benefit obligations has increased 
accordingly  as of march   we recorded an additional pension liability of million to recognize the increase in the under funded status of the plan 
in accordance with the accounting prescribed by sfas no 
 the liability was recorded through a direct charge to stockholders investment  net of the related tax effect of million 
in addition to the recognition of the minimum pension liability  the uk rules governing pension plan funding require us to make additional cash contributions into the plan over the next three years in the range of million to million per year 
we have not yet determined whether these additional contributions will be made through periodic lump sum payments or through an increase of the existing contribution rate and therefore no additional contributions to the plan have been made to date 
however  as a result of this significant change in the under funded status of the plan  the net periodic pension cost charged to earnings for fiscal is expected to increase over the amounts expensed in fiscal by approximately million 
additional charges to earnings will be required in future years 
the amount of such additional charges will depend on market conditions as of such dates and their impact on the plan and could be significant 
actuarial assumptions used to develop the estimates above include a discount rate of and expected return on plan assets of 

table of contents currency fluctuations through our foreign operations  we are exposed to currency fluctuations and exchange rate risks 
the majority of our revenue and expenses from our north sea operations are in british pound sterling 
in addition  some of our contracts to provide services internationally provide for payment in foreign currencies 
our foreign exchange rate risk is even greater when our revenue is denominated in a currency different from the associated costs 
we attempt to minimize our foreign exchange rate risk exposure by contracting the majority of our services other than our north sea operations in us dollars 
as a result  a strong us dollar may increase the local cost of our services that are provided under us dollar denominated contracts  which may reduce the demand for our services in foreign countries 
generally  we do not enter into hedging transactions to protect against foreign exchange risks related to our operating revenue 
because we maintain our financial statements in us dollars  we are vulnerable to fluctuations in the exchange rate between the british pound sterling and the us dollar and between other foreign currencies and the us dollar 
in preparing our financial statements  we must convert all non us dollar currencies to non us dollars 
the effect of foreign currency translation is reflected in a component of stockholders investment and foreign currency transaction gains or losses are credited or charged to income and reflected in other income expense 
in the past three fiscal years our stockholders investment has decreased by as much as million in some years and increased by as much as million as a result of translation adjustments 
changes in exchange rates could cause significant changes in our financial position and results of operations in the future 
the british pound sterling is the currency in which most of bristow s revenue and expenses are paid 
approximately of our operating revenue for fiscal  was translated for financial reporting purposes from british pound sterling into us dollars 
in addition  we receive other revenue that are not in us dollars or british pound sterling  such as australian dollars  euros  nigerian naira  and trinidad and tobago dollars 
we can reduce or eliminate our exposure to exchange rate fluctuations to the extent that we also have expenses that are payable in the same foreign currency as our revenue 
our principal exposure is to changes in the value of the british pound relative to the us dollar 
during fiscal  the british pound to us dollar exchange rate ranged from a low of one british pound us to a high of one british pound us  with an average of one british pound us for the fiscal year 
as of march   the exchange rate was one british pound us 
during fiscal  the british pound to us dollar exchange rate ranged from a low of one british pound us to a high of one british pound us for the fiscal year  with an average of one british pound us 
as of march   the exchange rate was one british pound us seasonality helicopter activities are seasonal in nature  as our flight activities are influenced by the length of daylight hours and weather conditions 
the worst of these conditions typically occur during the winter months when our ability to safely fly and our customers ability to safely conduct their operations is inhibited 
accordingly  our operating revenue is generally lower in the fourth fiscal quarter 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  effective for fiscal years beginning after june  this statement will require us to record the fair value of liabilities related to future asset retirement obligations in the period the obligation is incurred 
we expect to adopt sfas no 
on april  the nature of our operations does not create significant asset retirement obligations  therefore  management does not expect the adoption of this standard to materially impact our financial position or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
fin expands existing accounting guidance and disclosure requirements for certain guarantees and requires recognition  at the inception of a guarantee  of a liability for the fair value of an obligation undertaken in connection with issuing a guarantee 
the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for our fiscal financial statements and the remaining provisions of fin apply to guarantees issued or modified after december  we do not expect this interpretation to have a material impact on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 

table of contents in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
in general  a variable interest entity formerly referred to as a special purpose entity or spe is a corporation  partnership  trust or any other legal structure used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
fin requires consolidation of a variable interest entity by a company if that company is subject to the majority of risk of loss or residual return from the variable interest entity s activities 
fin is effective immediately for variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements for variable interest entities created prior to january   begins no later than with the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  we are currently evaluating the impact of the adoption of fin on our consolidated financial statements 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have million of debt outstanding  of which million carries a variable rate of interest 
management does not believe the remaining level of variable rate debt exposes us to a material amount of interest rate market risk 
however  the market value of our fixed rate debt fluctuates with changes in interest rates 
our convertible subordinated notes mature in december we are currently evaluating our options with regard to the refinancing of this obligation  which is expected to be completed prior to maturity 
our ability to refinance this fixed rate debt varies in response to significant changes in interest rates  among other factors 
we use off balance sheet hedging instruments to manage our risks associated with our operating activities conducted in foreign currencies 
in limited circumstances and when considered appropriate  we will use forward exchange contracts to hedge anticipated transactions 
we have historically used these instruments primarily in the buying and selling of certain spare parts  maintenance services and equipment 
we attempt to minimize our exposure to foreign currency fluctuations by matching our revenue and expenses in the same currency for our contracts 
most of our revenue and expenses from our north sea operations are denominated in british pound sterling 
as of march   we did not have any nominal forward exchange contracts outstanding 
management does not believe that our limited exposure to foreign currency exchange risk necessitates the extensive use of forward exchange contracts
