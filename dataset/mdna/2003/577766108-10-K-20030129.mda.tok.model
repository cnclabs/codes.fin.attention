item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis of its financial position and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the company s significant accounting policies are discussed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
management believes the critical accounting policies and areas that require the most significant judgments and estimates to be used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements are revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory valuation and income taxes 
revenue recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts the company recognizes revenue upon shipment of its products 
allowances for doubtful accounts are estimated based on estimates of losses related to customer receivable balances 
estimates are developed by using standard quantitative measures based on historical losses  adjusting for current economic conditions and  in some cases  evaluating specific customer accounts for risk of loss 
the establishment of reserves requires the use of judgment and assumptions regarding the potential for losses on receivable balances 
though the company considers these balances adequate and proper  changes in economic conditions in specific markets in which the company operates could have a material effect on reserve balances required 
inventory valuation the company s inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market 
under certain market conditions  estimates and judgments regarding the valuation of inventory are employed by the company to properly value inventory 
these estimates could vary significantly  either favorably or unfavorably  from actual requirements if future economic conditions  customer inventory levels or competitive conditions differ from our expectations 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing the company s consolidated financial statements  management is required to estimate income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
the process involves estimating actual current tax expense along with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for book and tax purposes 
these timing differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included in the company s consolidated balance sheet
