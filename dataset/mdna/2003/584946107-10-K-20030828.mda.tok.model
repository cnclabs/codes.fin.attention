such forward looking statements are not based on historical facts and involve known and unknown risks  uncertainties and othe r factors  which may cause the actual results of the company to be materially d ifferent from any future results expressed or implied by such forward looking s tatements 
the following discussion sets forth certain factors the company bel ieves could cause actual results to differ materially from those contemplated b y these forward looking statements 
the company disclaims any obligation to up date its forward looking statements 
results of operations critical accounting policies and estimates the discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operation s are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepare d in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united sta tes 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to mak e estimates and judgements that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilit ies  revenues and expenses 
on an on going basis  we evaluate these estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  capitalized software costs and goodwill 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various oth er assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgements about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
a ctual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or co nditions 
we believe the following critical accounting policies reflect our more significant estimates and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements 
revenue recognition the company derives revenue from licensing its proprietary applications softwar e and sub licensed software  sale of computer hardware and the services perform ed related to the installation  training  consultation and ongoing support of t he software 
license fee revenues are generally recognized when evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the fee is fixed and determinable  a nd collectibility is probable 
revenue from the sale of hardware is recognized upon shipment 
fees for installation  training and consultation are recognized as the services are provided 
if the company enters into arrangements with a c lient requiring significant customization of the software or services that are essential to the functionality of the software  the company recognizes revenue derived from the sale of licensed software  sub licensed software and services over the period the services are performed  in accordance with the american ins titute of certified public accountants statement of position  software revenue recognition 
support and maintenance fees  typically sold on an annual renewal basis  are recognized ratably over the pe riod of the support contract

goodwill goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the val ue assigned to the net tangible assets of businesses acquired 
these business a cquisitions include digimedics in  pharmakon which was merged into digime dics and jac in june and informedics in september costs allocated t o goodwill in the informedics acquisition totaled  and was being amorti zed over twelve years using the straight line method 
all other goodwill was be ing amortized using the straight line method over twenty years

the company did not make any debt repayments in fisca l the company s liquidity is influenced by its ability to perform on a best of b reed basis in a competitive industry that is currently impacted by consolidati ons of healthcare information system providers

factors that may affect future results fluctuations in quarterly operating results mediware s revenues and results of operations can fluctuate substantially from quarter to quarter 
system sales revenues in any quarter depend substantially u pon mediware s sales performance and the customer s budgeting and buying practi ces 
system sales in any quarter may fluctuate due to contract activity  demand for the company s products and services  lengthy and complex sales cycles  and the customer s internal budgets for new technology systems and technical resou rces to deploy them 
additionally  the terms of a final contract may materially affect the company s ability to recognize anticipated quarterly revenues 
fac tors include  but are not limited to  the following systems contracts may include both currently deliverable and non delivera ble software products 
customer needs for services that include significant modifications  custo mization or complex interfaces that could delay product delivery or acceptance 
customer specific acceptance criteria 
payment terms that are long term or depend upon contingencies 
reliance on third party software mediware licenses various third party software products that it incorporates in to its own software products 
these products may include operating systems  rel ational database management systems  knowledge clinical databases and other key systems 
the termination by any third party vendor of mediware s licenses to use these products  or a significant change to a relied upon product  could hav e a material adverse effect on mediware s operations 
changes that could have a material adverse effect include  for example  the third party products becomi ng inoperable  features and functions becoming unavailable  product performance being materially reduced  or unfavorable pricing changes 
although alternate software products are available  mediware could incur substantial costs if it i s required to adapt its products to alternative third party software products 
dependence on third party marketing relationships mediware s continued growth depends on its ability to build and maintain strong marketing partnerships 
the company believes its marketing and sales efforts a re enhanced by these relationships 
mediware has marketing partnerships with ce rtain laboratory or hospital information system software vendors who also are c ompetitors of mediware 
for example  mediware partners with mckesson hboc in t he area of blood bank products  however  mckesson hboc offers competing pharmac y and operating room products  either directly or through other partners 
labor atory and hospital information system software vendors are responding to the gr owing demand within the market to offer more fully integrated solutions to hosp itals 
given this dynamic  these vendors may choose to either develop stronger partnering relationships with clinical software providers like mediware or dec ide to develop their own solutions 
in the event that these marketing relation ships are discontinued  the company could experience a material adverse effect on its business  results of operations or financial c ondition 
changes in the healthcare industry the healthcare industry is heavily regulated by various governmental and regula tory bodies 
the decisions made and initiatives promulgated by these bodies may significantly influence operations of hospitals and healthcare organizations 
their influence affects purchasing and investment decisions by hospitals  which could impact negotiations with the company 
many hospitals are consolidating and forming or becoming part of integrated h ealthcare delivery networks ihdns 
the formation of ihdns might reduce the number of discrete prospects the company may target and could provide more nego tiating leverage to the company s prospective customers 
these events  if they occurred  could result in a reduction of selling prices  an increase in the len gth of the sales cycle  or other situations that could negatively affect the co mpany 
significant competition the market for healthcare information systems is extremely competitive 
some o f the company s competitors are sms  mckesson hboc  cerner corporation  ge medi cal systems  and sunquest acquired by misys plc  each of which offer products that compete with certain offerings of the company 
many of the company s comp etitors have greater financial  technical  product development  sales and marke ting resources 
a number of factors determine success or failure in this market  including the functionality of the software  the quality of client references  the underlying technical architecture  the financial stability of the softwar e provider  the ongoing support of the system  and the quality and quantity of the sales organization 
the company s ability to maintain a positive stance in all of the above areas will affect its ability to compete successfully 
managing growth mediware s ability to manage future growth is partly dependent on the ability t o recruit  train and retain employees that possess industry specific expertise 
the company has experienced significant growth in service related revenues  cu stomer base and product development activity 
the company plans to continue to invest heavily in new product development in all divisions 
mediware s success will partially depend upon its ability to recruit  manage and maintain appropri ate staffing levels of technical and industry expertise to meet customer needs and service new sales 
the market for such personnel is highly competitive  mak ing it difficult to adjust staffing timely in reaction to fluctuations in sales activity 
government regulation the hospitals that comprise the primary market for the company s products must comply with various federal  state and local statutes and regulations 
the adeq uacy of blood bank information management and record keeping products are subje ct to regulation  inspection and review by the fda 
the company s blood bank products are regulated as medical devices by the fda 
blood bank software vendors are also subject to the fda s quality systems regu lations qsr 
mediware s qsr currently conforms to the fda s regulation 
a lthough mediware has updated its internal quality system to comply with new gui delines adopted under these regulations  it cannot predict whether it will be f ully in compliance with these guidelines or any future guidelines  regulations or inspection procedures 
non compliance with any such guidelines  regulations or procedures could have a material adverse effect on the operations of clinic al information system vendors of blood bank information systems  including medi ware 
the fda modernization act of was enacted on november  and became e ffective on february  under this legislation  the fda is directed to consider the extent to which reliance on post market controls could expedite th e pre market notification review process and the classification of devices 
th e legislation also requires the fda to ensure that good manufacturing practices conform  to the extent practicable  to internationally recognized standards fo r medical devices 
neither of these provisions appears on its face to contempl ate regulation which would have a material adverse effect on the company s bloo d bank information system operations  however  the legislation expanded the jur isdiction of the fda and the company is unable to predict the effect of any res ulting applicable future regulation 
if any of the company s other products be come subject to congressional or governmental agency efforts to establish or ex pand governmental agency jurisdiction  compliance would likely be costly an d time consuming 
on june   a customer notification was distributed to hemocare customers identifying a particular condition having the potential for an antigen typing error involving the unit antigen test entry of the hemocare blood bank data man agement system 
this notification provided a procedural work around until the software  hemocare version  was released in october although clients reported no adverse events  this customer notification was reported to the fda pursuant to the medical device reporting regulations as required 
in a mutuall y agreed upon initiative with the fda  mediware issued corrective actions to as sist its customers with their upgrade to hemocare version during fiscal  the hemocare registered facility was inspected by the fda 
the inspection noted that several customers used an outdated hemocare version and two deficiencies additionally noted non compliance of customers with title code of federal regulations 
this code refers to electronic records mainta ined by the manufacturers 
 mediware issued corrective action that results i n updating all of the customers in the field to the fda compliant version o f hemocare 
this action is ongoing 
additional product clearance was received from the fda on february  to market the hcll transfusion management system 
the clearance opens the way for the company to begin marketing hcll to the marketplace 
the company has dedicated substantial time and resources to comply with applica ble guidelines and regulations 
the fda enforces compliance by such actions as recalls  seizures  injunctions  civil fines and criminal prosecutions 
unsatis factory compliance and the inability to timely remedy any non compliance  resul ting in any of the above actions  would have a material adverse effect on the c ompany s business  financial condition and results of operations 
new regulations relating to patient confidentiality the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa manda tes significant changes in the legal and regulatory environment governing the p rovision of health benefits  the delivery of and payment for healthcare service s  and the security and confidentiality of individually identifiable  protected health information in written  electronic or oral formats 
the department of health and human services adopted final rules implementing hipaa 
the final ru les include standards for the security of electronic health information and the privacy of a patient s medical records and became effective on february   and april   respectively 
most healthcare providers  healthcare cle aringhouses and health plans covered entities are required to comply 
cover ed entities are required to comply with the standards for security by april  and have been required to comply with the standards for privacy since apr il  although the company is not a covered entity  most of the company s customers are covered entities 
as covered entities  the company s customers are required to flow down certain of their obligations under hipaa to their service providers 
accordingly  the company has been required to adopt different and or additional procedures 
in a ddition  the company has had increased legal expenses associated with negotiati ng agreements with existing and new customers to implement the new hipaa obliga tions 
in light of the new obligations under hipaa  covered entities may be re quired or may choose to reevaluate their technology solutions 
the company may be required to invest in its products and procedures to maintain compliance 
in addition  many states have passed or are evaluating local versions of hipaa 
t he company believes  but cannot assure  that hipaa will not materially affect t he business of the company 
product related liabilities all of the company s products provide data for use by healthcare providers in p atient care settings 
mediware s license agreements contain provisions to limit exposure to product related claims 
these provisions  however  may not be enf orceable in some jurisdictions 
the company maintains product liability insura nce at an amount it believes adequate for its intended purpose  however  there can be no assurances that the insurance will cover a claim brought against the company 
although no claims have been brought against the company to date for injuries related to the use of its products  there is a risk that such claims c ould be pursued 
a successful claim brought against the company  not covered b y insurance or greater than the insured limits  could have a material adverse e ffect upon the company s business  results of operations or financial condition system errors and warranties despite testing by mediware  software products as complex as those offered by t he company and used in a wide range of clinical and health information systems settings are likely to contain a number of errors or bugs  especially early i n their product life cycle
