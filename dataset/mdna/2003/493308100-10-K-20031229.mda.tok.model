revenue from our consulting and support services  which includes revenue from our load testing services  is recognized as the services are performed  typically over a period of one to three months 
for longer consulting projects that span more than one month  we recognize revenue as milestones or deliverables are completed 
a majority of our subscription revenue comes from our web performance benchmarking services  which include our perspective services 
subscription revenue also includes our red alert and netmechanic monitoring and alarm services  test perspective subscription services  webeffective subscription services  performance management subscription services and our private agent application performance management services 
our customers purchase these services for an initial term of three to twelve months and then may renew on an annual  semi annual  or month to month basis 
subscription services fees can vary based on the number of urls measured  the number of devices monitored  the number of measurement locations  the number of users  the number of hours  the frequency of the measurements  the number of private agents  the additional features ordered  and the type of services purchased 
we offer our consulting and support services on a per engagement basis 
consulting and support services revenue amounted to approximately of total revenue for the years ended september  and we believe that consulting and support services revenue may increase somewhat in the future as a percentage of total 
table of contents revenue  as our existing consulting and support services become more widely used and we introduce additional services that require consulting expertise 
however  we cannot assure you that this revenue will increase in absolute dollars in future periods

in addition  our customers that have monthly renewal arrangements may terminate their services at any time with little or no penalty 
if we lose a major customer or a group of significant customers  our revenue could significantly decline

table of contents comparison of fiscal years ended september  and revenue change in thousands subscription services consulting and support services total revenue subscription services 
revenue from subscription services increased slightly by  during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  subscription services represented of total revenue for both of the years ended september  and september  the increase in revenue in absolute dollars was primarily attributable to increased revenue from our wireless perspective  netmechanic  webeffective  and private agent services  offset by a decrease in our benchmarking revenue 
consulting and support services 
revenue from consulting and support services increased by  or  during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  revenue from consulting and support services represented approximately of total revenue for the years ended september  and the increase in revenue in absolute dollars resulted primarily due to the increased contribution from keynote diagnostic services and the additional product offering of webeffective  which was introduced in the first quarter of fiscal because our consulting and support services are provided on a per engagement basis  revenue depends on the number of engagements and the size of such engagements 
as a result  consulting and support services revenue are less predictable than subscription services revenue and  may vary from period to period 
for the years ended september  and  no single customer accounted for more than of total revenue 
at september   no customer accounted for more than of total accounts receivable 
at september   one customer accounted for more than of total accounts receivable  which receivable was collected subsequent to september expenses costs of subscription services and consulting and support services change in thousands costs of subscription services costs of consulting and support services costs of subscription services

costs of subscription services decreased by approximately million  or  during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of subscription services revenue for the year ended september  and  respectively 
this decrease was primarily due to reduced costs for bandwidth and  to a lesser extent  lower depreciation expenses

costs of consulting and support services increased by  or  during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  and represented and of consulting and support service revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
the increase was primarily due to costs associated with our webeffective service  which we 
table of contents acquired in october  offset  in part  by a decrease in bandwidth costs 
we expect that the costs of consulting services as a percentage of consulting services revenue will continue to be greater than the costs of subscription services as a percentage of subscription service revenue 
we expect that costs of consulting and support services in absolute dollars and as a percentage of revenue for the first quarter of fiscal will be higher than the fourth quarter of fiscal due to costs related to the acquisition of certain assets of xaffire  inc completed in december research and development change in thousands research and development research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for research and development personnel 
research and development expenses decreased by million  or  during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  this decrease was primarily attributable to lower costs resulting from a reduced number of research and development personnel and reduced salaries  offset  in part  by additional personnel costs related to acquisitions 
to date  all research and development expenses have been expensed as incurred 
we anticipate that research and development expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will increase from the fourth quarter of fiscal due to additional personnel costs related to the acquisition of certain assets of xaffire  inc completed in december sales and marketing change in thousands sales and marketing sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of salaries  commissions and bonuses earned by sales and marketing personnel  lead referral fees  marketing programs and travel expenses 
our sales and marketing expenses decreased by million  or  during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease primarily resulted from a reduced number of sales and marketing personnel  and to a lesser extent  from reduced spending on certain marketing programs 
we believe that continued investments in our sales and marketing efforts are essential for us to maintain our market position and to further increase acceptance of our services 
we anticipate that sales and marketing expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will increase compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to expenses associated with our global internet performance conference 
operations change in thousands operations operations expenses consist primarily of compensation and related costs for management and technical support personnel who manage and maintain our field measurement and collection infrastructure and headquarters data center  and provide basic customer support hours per day  days a week 
our operations personnel also work closely with other departments to assure the reliability of our services and to support our sales and marketing activities 
our operations expenses decreased by million  or  during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease in operations expenses was primarily the result of improving operating efficiencies and to lower personnel costs from reducing the number of personnel in the operations group  and  to a lesser extent  to reduced salaries 
we anticipate that operations expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will remain comparable to the fourth quarter of fiscal 
table of contents general and administrative change in thousands general and administrative general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses  accounting  legal and administrative expenses  insurance  professional services fees and other general corporate expenses 
our general and administrative expenses decreased by  or  during the year ended september  as compared to the year ended september  the decrease in our general and administrative expenses was primarily attributable to a reduced number of general and administrative personnel  reduced salaries  and lower bad debt provisions  and  to a lesser extent  to lower spending on professional service fees 
we anticipate that general and administrative expenses in absolute dollars for the first quarter of fiscal will decrease slightly compared to the fourth quarter of fiscal due to reduced personnel costs associated with a reduction in personnel 
excess occupancy costs change in thousands excess occupancy costs excess occupancy costs are fixed expenses associated with the unoccupied portion of our headquarters building  acquired in september  such as property taxes  insurance  and depreciation 
the costs are based on the actual unoccupied square footage  which was for the first nine months and for the last three months for the year ended september  lease termination charge change in thousands lease termination charge in july  we entered into a five year synthetic lease agreement for our corporate headquarters building in san mateo  california 
on september   we terminated the lease and purchased the property for a total of million 
the lease  which was due to expire in  provided for a residual guarantee of a total of million due at the end of the lease term or upon lease termination 
our obligation was fully collateralized with restricted cash of million 
after we entered into the lease in july  real estate market conditions worsened  including a significant increase in available space for lease and significant declines in corresponding lease rates for commercial property 
accordingly  a loss on termination of this lease was recognized in connection with the purchase of the building in september the loss was calculated by comparing the purchase price of the building to its fair value 
to determine the fair value of the building  we had an independent real estate appraisal conducted  which indicated that the fair value of the property was approximately million 
the calculated loss of approximately million was recorded in the fourth quarter of fiscal the million loss on termination was adjusted for the reversal of the remaining excess facility charge accrual and costs associated with the acquisition of the building  resulting in a net charge to the consolidated statements of operations of approximately million for the year ended september

amortization of identifiable intangible assets increased by approximately  for the year ended september  in connection with our acquisitions of netmechanic in may  enviz in october  and streamcheck in july at september   we had a remaining balance of approximately million of identifiable intangible assets that are being amortized over a three year period from the date of acquisition 
the remaining balance will be fully amortized by july certain options granted prior to june   have been considered to be compensatory  as the estimated fair value for accounting purposes was greater than the stock price as determined by the board of directors on the date of grant 
as a result  we recorded amortization of deferred compensation expense of  during the year ended september   compared to  for the year ended september  the decrease in the amortization of deferred compensation from fiscal to fiscal was a result of our discontinuing to amortize costs associated with former employees that had been terminated 
deferred compensation was amortized on a straight line basis over the vesting period of the options and was fully amortized as of september  the in process research and development charge of  for the year ended september  related to the estimated fair value of an acquired in process research and development project  which we acquired in connection with our acquisition of netmechanic  that had not yet reached technological feasibility and had no alternative future use  related to netmechanic s technology for web site testing 
the estimated fair value of this project was determined based on the actual costs incurred as of the acquisition date 
this amount was immediately expensed as of the acquisition date 
we review our identifiable intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of these assets may not be recoverable 
we expect the amortization of identifiable intangible assets to be approximately  for the first quarter of fiscal  assuming no additional acquisitions or impairment charges 
we expect the remaining carrying value of the identifiable intangible assets as of september   as listed in the table below  will be fully amortized by july in thousands technology based customer based trademark total net carrying value at september

the decrease in interest income was primarily attributable to a lower level of invested cash due to the use of million of restricted cash to purchase our headquarters building in september  the use of approximately million of cash used to repurchase our common stock primarily in our two issuer tender offers in november and may  and the continued decline in interest rates 
substantially all of the interest income represents interest earned from our cash  short term investments and restricted cash 
we expect that net interest income for the first quarter of fiscal will be approximately  absent any additional transactions  and assuming no material changes in interest rates 
provision for income taxes no benefit for federal  state  and foreign income taxes was recorded for the years ended september  and  because we provided a valuation allowance against the deferred tax assets generated from the operating loss

we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents will be sufficient to meet our anticipated cash needs for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next months 
if  after some period of time  cash generated from operations is insufficient to satisfy our liquidity requirements  we may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities or to obtain a credit facility 
if additional funds are raised through the issuance of debt securities  these securities could have rights  preferences and privileges senior to holders of common stock  and the term of this debt could impose restrictions on our operations 
the sale of additional equity or convertible debt securities could result in dilution to our stockholders  and we may not be able to obtain additional financing on acceptable terms  if at all

table of contents critical accounting policies and judgments in preparing our consolidated financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states for interim financial statements  our management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
our critical accounting policies and judgments are of both a routine and non routine nature 
the recurring policies relate to revenue recognition  the allowance for doubtful accounts receivable  and goodwill impairments 
the non routine policy relates to the valuation of our long lived assets 
revenue recognition subscription services revenue consists of fees from subscriptions to our internet measurement  monitoring  testing and diagnostic services 
our subscription services revenue is generally deferred upon invoicing and is recognized ratably over the service period  generally ranging from one to twelve months 
for some customers  subscription services revenue is invoiced monthly upon completion of the services 
we do not generally grant refunds 
all discounts granted reduce revenue 
revenue is not recognized for free trial periods 
revenue from our consulting and support services  which includes revenue from our load testing service  is recognized as the services are performed  typically over a period of one to three months 
for consulting projects that span more than one month  we recognize revenue as milestones or deliverables are completed 
allowance for doubtful accounts receivable our accounting policy for our allowance for doubtful accounts is determined based on historical trends  experience and current market and industry conditions 
we regularly review the adequacy of our accounts receivable allowance after considering the age of each invoice of the accounts receivable aging  each customer s expected ability to pay and our collection history with each customer 
we review invoices greater than days past due to determine whether an allowance is appropriate based on the receivable balance 
in addition  we maintain a reserve for all other invoices  which is calculated by applying a percentage  based on historical collection trends  to the outstanding accounts receivable balance 
the allowance for doubtful accounts represents management s best estimate  but changes in circumstances  in the future  relating to accounts receivable may result in a requirement for additional allowances in the future or reductions in allowances due to future recoveries or trends 
accounts receivable is recorded net of an allowance for doubtful accounts receivable of approximately million  or of total account receivable  and million  or of total accounts receivable  as of september  and  respectively 
the slight decrease in our allowance for doubtful accounts is due to improved collection efforts as well as a reduction in loss experience 
impairment assessments of goodwill and identifiable intangibles our methodology for allocating the purchase price relating to acquisitions is determined based on valuations performed by an independent third party 
goodwill is measured as the excess of the cost of acquisition over the sum of the amounts assigned to identifiable assets acquired less liabilities assumed 
effective october   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
with our adoption of sfas no 
 we reassessed the useful lives and residual values of all acquired intangible assets to identify any necessary amortization period adjustments and to determine if any amount of identifiable intangible assets should be reclassified to goodwill 
based on that assessment  no adjustments were made to the amortization periods or residual values of identifiable intangible assets 
sfas no 
provides a six month transitional period from the effective date of adoption for us to perform an assessment as to whether there is an indication that goodwill is impaired 
to accomplish this  we identified our reporting units and determined the carrying value of each reporting unit by assigning the assets and liabilities  including the existing goodwill and identifiable intangible assets  to those reporting units as of the date of adoption 
we determined that we had one reporting unit 

table of contents sfas no 
requires us to determine the fair value of our one reporting unit as of october   and compare it to the reporting unit s carrying amount 
to the extent that the reporting unit s carrying amount exceeds its fair value  an indication exists that the reporting unit s goodwill may be impaired and we must perform the second step of the transitional impairment test 
during the second quarter of fiscal  we performed the first step of the transitional impairment test required under sfas no 
 and obtained an indicator of impairment in our single reporting unit 
during the third quarter of fiscal  we performed the second step of the transitional impairment test 
in the second step  in accordance with sfas no 
 we compared the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill  determined by allocating the reporting unit s fair value to all of its assets recognized and unrecognized and liabilities in a manner similar to a purchase price allocation to its carrying amount  both of which could be measured as of the date of adoption 
we determined the fair value of our single reporting unit using our market capitalization value after adjusting for a control premium and compared it to our carrying value 
we determined our market capitalization value based on the number of shares outstanding and the stock price as of october   adjusting for a premium that is assumed to represent additional value that an acquirer would be required to pay for a controlling interest in the company 
this evaluation indicated that goodwill associated with acquisitions completed prior to fiscal year was impaired as of october  accordingly  we recorded a million non cash impairment charge as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write off of the remaining goodwill as of october  the charge is reflected in the results for the year ended september  we perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances for our single reporting unit 
the goodwill recorded on the consolidated balance sheets as of september  was  as compared to as of september  valuation of long lived assets we evaluate the recoverability of fixed assets and identifiable intangible assets other than goodwill whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amount of any such asset group may not be fully recoverable 
changes in circumstances include economic conditions or operating performance 
our evaluation is based upon assumptions about the estimated future undiscounted net cash flows from such asset groups 
management continually applies its best judgment when performing these evaluations to determine the timing of the testing  the undiscounted net cash flows used to assess recoverability and the fair value of the asset group 
if future events or circumstances indicate that an impairment assessment is required and an asset group is determined to be impaired  our financial results could be materially and adversely impacted in future periods

table of contents factors that may impact future operating results we have introduced new products and services  and we have an unproven business model  which makes it difficult to evaluate our current business and future prospects 
we have recently introduced many new products  including in october  we introduced keynote diagnostic services  which performs root cause analysis with diagnostic functionality to strengthen the value of e business web performance data customers already receive through keynote s performance measurement services and performance management solutions 
in march  we introduced eight new web transaction performance indices that include banking  computers  health care  home loans  home specialty  hotel and travel  pharmaceuticals and retail 
in may  we introduced two new web transaction performance benchmarking indices  the keynote consumer e commerce transaction index and the keynote e banking transaction index 
in june  we introduced our best practices for total performance management for e government that are targeted at operations  application development and testing personnel within federal  state and local government agencies 
we also introduced an updated version of our webintegrity service 
in july  we introduced red alert performance tracker  a cost effective  self service performance monitoring solution for the budget conscious operational user that provides the essentials for understanding web site performance  including alarms on both performance and availability 
we also introduced an updated version of our transaction perspective which added many important new features and functionality for measuring accurately  realistically and representatively the effect on end user performance and availability and an updated version of our webeffective product adding new reporting functionality to make analyzing web site user behavior easier and simpler 
in addition  we acquired the business of streamcheck  which provides quality measurements of streaming media delivery by simulating the behavior of end users in cities around the world 
in august  we introduced our best practices for total performance management for retailers  which are targeted at operations  application development and testing personnel within large online retailers 
in october  we introduced an updated version of our wireless perspective product and we introduced several new products including  application perspective  an end to end monitoring and root cause diagnostics solution  performance scoreboard  a customized portal for the visual management of service level objectives for multi property  multi location e businesses  performancetune  a tuning service that combines keynote s load testing infrastructure with detailed back end monitoring to isolate and repair performance bottlenecks  and test perspective for siebel  a load testing service that utilizes our load generation infrastructure to help companies validate the performance of their entire siebel application infrastructure 
the long term revenue and income potential of our current business and services and the related markets are unproven 
in addition  because some of our products and services are new and because the market for web performance management services is evolving  we have limited insight into trends that may emerge and affect our business 
we have incurred and may in the future continue to incur losses  and we may not sustain profitability 
we experienced operating losses in each annual period since inception and in each quarterly period since inception through the third quarter of fiscal we may not be able to sustain operating profitability in the future 
we incurred net losses of million for the year ended september   and as of september   we had an accumulated deficit of million 
in addition  we are required under generally accepted 
table of contents accounting principles to review our goodwill and identifiable intangible assets for impairment when events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
as of september   we had approximately million of identifiable intangible assets and  of goodwill 
if we complete additional acquisitions in the future  we may have additional goodwill and or identifiable intangibles and  accordingly  may incur expenses in connection with a write down of goodwill and identifiable intangible assets due to changes in market conditions as we did in the quarter ended june  when we recorded an impairment charge for goodwill and identifiable intangible assets of million in connection with our acquisitions of velogic and digital content 
in addition  in fiscal  we recorded a charge of approximately million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle for the write off of all the remaining goodwill associated with our acquisitions made prior to september  we believe that our operating expenses could increase as they have in certain past periods 
as a result  we will need to increase our revenue to sustain profitability 
we may not sustain a sequential quarterly increase in revenue and may never be able to regain our historic revenue growth rates 
the success of our business depends on customers renewing their subscriptions for our services and purchasing additional services 
to maintain and grow our revenue  we must achieve and maintain high customer renewal rates for our services 
our customers have no obligation to renew our services and therefore  they could cease using our services at any time 
in addition  our customers may renew for fewer services 
further  our customers may reduce their use of our services during the term of their subscription 
we cannot project the level of renewal rates 
our customer renewal rates may decline as a result of a number of factors  including consolidations in the internet industry or if a significant number of our customers cease operations 
further  we depend on sales to new customers and sales of additional services to our existing customers 
renewals by existing customers or purchases of our services by new customers may be limited as companies limit or reduce their technology spending in response to uncertain economic conditions 
we have experienced an increase in cancellations and non renewals in the past and may continue to experience an increased amount of cancellations and or non renewals 
we have experienced  and may in the future experience  cancellations and or reduction in service 
if we experience reduced renewal rates or if customers renew for a lesser amount of our services  or if customers  at any time  reduce the amount of services they purchase from us  our revenue could continue to decline unless we are able to obtain additional customers or sources of revenue  sufficient to replace lost revenue 
continued reductions and or cancellations could also result in our inability to collect amounts due 
our quarterly financial results are subject to significant fluctuations  and if our future results are below the expectations of investors  the price of our common stock may decline 
results of operations could vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
if revenue falls below our expectations  we may not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to the shortfall 
other factors that could affect our quarterly operating results include those described below and elsewhere in this report the rate of new and renewed subscriptions to our services  the amount and timing of any reductions by our customers in their usage of our services  our ability to increase the number of web sites we measure and the scope of services we offer for our existing customers in a particular quarter  our ability to attract new customers in a quarter  particularly larger customers  our ability to successfully introduce new products and services to offset any reductions in revenue  the timing and amount of consulting and support services revenue  which is difficult to predict in any given quarter due to the short term nature of these engagements  the timing and amount of operating costs and capital expenditures relating to expansion or contraction of our domestic and international operations infrastructure  
table of contents the timing and amount  if any  of impairment charges related to potential write down of acquired assets in acquisitions  and the timing and amount  if any  of restructuring costs if we are required to further restructure our operations  due to these and other factors  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not meaningful and should not be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
it is possible that in some future periods  our results of operations may be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
if this occurs  the price of our common stock may decline 
if we are required by law or elect to account for stock options under our stock option plans as a compensation expense  our results of operations would be materially affected 
we expect that we will be required to record compensation expense in connection with option grants in accordance with sfas that have an exercise price at or above fair market value 
it is possible that future laws or regulations will require us to treat all stock options as a compensation expense or we may voluntarily elect to do so 
if there is any such change in accounting regulations or if we elect to account for options in this way  this could result in our reporting increased operating expenses  which would decrease any reported net income or increase any reported net loss 
note of our consolidated financial statements shows the impact that such a change in accounting treatment would have had on our net loss and net income loss per share if it had been in effect during the reporting periods shown and if the compensation expense were calculated as described in note our operating results could be harmed if sales of our web performance measurement services decline 
sales of our web performance measurement services  primarily our web site perspective business edition services  and  to a lesser degree  our transaction perspective services  have generated a majority of our total revenue 
therefore  the success of our business currently depends  and for the immediate future will continue to substantially depend  on sales and renewals of our benchmarking services 
we have  from time to time  increased the prices of our web performance measurement services  which could reduce demand for these services 
this could result in decreased sales  which would cause our revenue to decline 
improvements to the infrastructure of the internet could reduce or eliminate demand for our internet performance measurement services 
the demand for our internet performance measurement services could be reduced or eliminated if future improvements to the infrastructure of the internet lead companies to conclude that the measurement and evaluation of the performance of their web sites is no longer important to their business 
because the inherent complexity of the internet currently causes significant quality of service problems for e business companies  the vendors and operators that supply and manage the underlying infrastructure are continuously seeking to improve the speed  availability  reliability and consistency of the internet 
if these vendors and operators succeed in significantly improving the performance of the internet  which would result in corresponding improvements in the performance of companies web sites  demand for our services would likely decline which would harm our operating results 
the inability of our services to perform properly could result in loss of or delay in revenue  injury to our reputation or other harm to our business 
we offer complex services  which may not perform at the level our customers expect 
we have  in the past  occasionally given credits to customers as a result of past problems with our service 
despite our testing  our existing or future services may not perform as expected due to unforeseen problems  which could result in loss of or delay in revenue  loss of market share  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development 
table of contents resources  injury to our reputation  increased insurance costs or increased service costs 
in addition  we have acquired  rather than developed internally  some of our services in connection with our acquisitions of companies and businesses 
these services may not perform at the level we or our customers expect 
these problems could also result in tort or warranty claims 
although we attempt to reduce the risk of losses resulting from any claims through warranty disclaimers and liability limitation clauses in our customer agreements  these contractual provisions may not be enforceable in every instance 
furthermore  although we maintain errors and omissions insurance  this insurance coverage may not adequately cover us for claims 
if a court refused to enforce the liability limiting provisions of our contracts for any reason  or if liabilities arose that were not contractually limited or adequately covered by insurance  we could be required to pay damages 
if we do not continually improve our services in response to technological changes  including changes to the internet  we may encounter difficulties retaining existing customers and attracting new customers 
the ongoing evolution of the internet requires us to continually improve the functionality  features and reliability of our web performance management services  particularly in response to offerings of our competitors 
if we do not succeed in developing and marketing new services that respond to competitive and technological developments and changing customer needs  we may encounter difficulties retaining existing customers and attracting new customers 
we must also introduce any new services as quickly as possible 
the success of new services depends on several factors  including proper definition of the scope of the new services and timely completion  introduction and market acceptance of our new services 
if new internet  networking or telecommunication technologies or standards are widely adopted or if other technological changes occur  we may need to expend significant resources to adapt our services to these 
we face competition that could make it difficult for us to acquire and retain customers 
the market for web performance measurement and management services is rapidly evolving 
our competitors vary in size and in the scope and breadth of the products and services that they offer 
we face competition from companies that offer software and services with features similar to our services such as mercury interactive  gomez advisors  segue software  watchfire and a variety of small companies that offer a combination of testing  market research capabilities and data 
while we believe these services are not as comprehensive as ours  customers could still choose to use these services or these companies could enhance their services to offer all of the features we offer 
as we expand the scope of our products and services  we expect to encounter many additional market specific competitors 
we could also face competition from other companies  which currently do not offer services similar to our services  but offer software or services related to web performance benchmarking  testing  and application performance management  such as webcriteria  a division of coremetrics  inc and ins insoft division  an unit of lucent technologies  and free services that measure web site availability 
in addition  companies that sell systems management software  such as bmc software  compuware  ca unicenter  hp openview  quest software  netiq  veritas precise software  and ibm s tivoli unit  with some of whom we have strategic relationships  could choose to offer services similar to ours 
in the future  we intend to expand our service offerings and continue to measure and manage the performance of emerging technologies such as internet telephony  wireless devices  and wireless fidelity  or wi fi  networks and  as a result  could face competition from other companies 
some of our existing and future competitors have or may have longer operating histories  larger customer bases  greater brand recognition in similar businesses  and significantly greater financial  marketing  technical and other resources 
in addition  some of our competitors may be able to devote greater resources to marketing and promotional campaigns  to adopt more aggressive pricing policies  and to devote substantially more resources to technology and systems development 
increased competition may result in price reductions  increased costs of providing our services and loss of market share  any of which could seriously harm our business 
we may not be able to compete successfully against our current and future competitors 

table of contents a limited number of customers account for a significant portion of our revenue  and the loss of a major customer could harm our operating results 
ten customers accounted for approximately  and of our total revenue for the years ended september    and  respectively 
we cannot be certain that customers that have accounted for significant revenue in past periods  individually or as a group  will renew  will not cancel or will not reduce their services and  therefore  continue to generate revenue in any future period 
in addition  our customers that do not have written contracts may terminate their services at any time with little or no penalty 
if we lose a major customer  our revenue could decline 
if we do not complement our direct sales force with relationships with other companies to help market our web performance management services  we may not be able to grow our business 
to increase sales of our web performance management services worldwide  we must complement our direct sales force with relationships with companies to help market and sell our services to their customers 
if we are unable to maintain our existing marketing and distribution relationships  or fail to enter into additional relationships  we may have to devote substantially more resources to the direct sale and marketing of our services 
we would also lose anticipated revenue from customer referrals and other co marketing benefits 
in the year ended september   we terminated relationships with two of our international resellers 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we also terminated another relationship with one of our international resellers  and we may be required to terminate other reseller relationships in fiscal as a result  we are investing time and resources in evaluating replacements for these resellers and are committing resources to modify our direct sales effort in the united kingdom and germany 
our success depends in part on the ability of these companies to help market and sell our services 
our existing relationships do not  and any future relationships may not  afford us any exclusive marketing or distribution rights 
therefore  they could reduce their commitment to us at any time in the future 
many of these companies have multiple relationships and they may not regard us as significant for their business 
in addition  these companies generally may terminate their relationships with us  pursue other relationships with our competitors or develop or acquire products or services that compete with our services 
even if we succeed in entering into these relationships  they may not result in additional customers or revenue 
we must retain qualified personnel in a competitive marketplace  or we may not be able to grow our business 
we may be unable to retain our key employees  namely our management team and experienced engineers  or to attract  assimilate or retain other highly qualified employees 
although we  and a number of other technology companies  have implemented workforce reductions  there remains substantial competition for highly skilled employees 
our key employees are not bound by agreements that could prevent them from terminating their employment at any time 
if we fail to attract and retain key employees  our business could be harmed 
if the market does not accept our professional services  our results of operations could be harmed 
consulting and support services revenue represented approximately of total revenue for the year ended september  the cost of consulting and support services has  at times  exceeded our consulting revenue 
we expect that the costs of consulting and support services as a percentage of consulting and support services revenue will be greater than the costs of subscription services as a percentage of subscription services revenue 
we will also need to successfully market these services to potential customers in order to increase revenue 
each consulting engagement typically spans a one to three month period  and therefore  it is more difficult for us to predict the amount of consulting and support services revenue recognized in any particular quarter 
there are many experienced firms that offer computer network and internet related consulting services 
these consulting services providers include consulting companies  such as accenture and ernst young  as 
table of contents well as consulting divisions of large technology companies such as ibm 
because we do not have an established reputation for delivering consulting services  because this area is very competitive  and due to our limited experience in delivering consulting services  we may not succeed in selling these services 
the success of our business depends on the continued use of the internet by business and consumers for e business and communications 
because our business is based on providing web performance management services  the internet must continue to be used as a means of electronic business  or e business  and communications 
in addition  we believe that the use of the internet for conducting business transactions could be hindered for a number of reasons  including  but not limited to security concerns including the potential for fraud or theft of stored data and information communicated over the internet  inconsistent quality of service  including well publicized outages of popular web sites  lack of availability of cost effective  high speed services  limited numbers of local access points for corporate users  delay in the development of enabling technologies or adoption of new standards  inability to integrate business applications with the internet  the need to operate with multiple and frequently incompatible products  and a lack of tools to simplify access to and use of the internet 
our network infrastructure could be disrupted by a number of different occurrences  which could impair our ability to serve and retain existing customers or attract new customers 
all data collected from our measurement computers are stored in and distributed from our operations center  which we maintain at a single location 
therefore  our operations depend upon our ability to maintain and protect our computer systems  most of which are located at our corporate headquarters in san mateo  california  which is an area susceptible to earthquakes and possible power outages 
although we completed a generator project to provide our own source of long term uninterruptible power  if we experience power outages at our operations center  we might not be able to promptly receive data from our measurement computers and we might not be able to deliver our services to our customers on a timely basis 
we are currently developing a redundant system for computer network and other services at an alternate site 
various factors could cause us to not be able to ever complete such systems 
therefore  our operations systems are vulnerable to damage from break ins  computer viruses  unauthorized access  vandalism  fire  floods  earthquakes  power loss  telecommunications failures and similar events 
although we maintain insurance against fires  earthquakes and general business interruptions  the amount of coverage may not be adequate in any particular case 
if our operations center is damaged  causing a disruption in our services  this could impair our ability to retain existing customers or attract new customers 
if our computer infrastructure is not functioning properly  we may not be able to deliver our services in a timely or accurate manner 
we have occasionally experienced outages of our service in the past  which have typically lasted no more than a few hours  with the last one of significance occurring in october the outages that we have experienced have lasted no more than a few hours 
these outages have been caused by a variety of factors including electrical distribution equipment malfunctions  operator error  the failure of a back up computer to operate when the primary computer ceased functioning and power outages due to our previous facility s being inadequately equipped to house our operations center 
any outage for any period of time or loss of customer data could cause us to lose customers 

table of contents individuals who attempt to breach our network security  such as hackers  could  if successful  misappropriate proprietary information or cause interruptions in our services 
although in the past  we had a breach of our security through what appears to be unauthorized access to certain data belonging to one of our customers  we have not yet experienced any breaches of our network security or sabotage that has prevented us from serving our customers 
we might be required to expend significant capital and resources to protect against  or to alleviate  problems caused by hackers 
we may not have a timely remedy against a hacker who is able to breach our network security 
in addition to intentional security breaches  the inadvertent transmission of computer viruses could expose us to litigation or to a material risk of loss 
our measurement computers are located at sites that we do not own or operate  and it could be difficult for us to maintain or repair them if they do not function properly 
our measurement computers are located at facilities that are not owned by our customers or us 
instead  these computers are installed at locations near various internet access points worldwide 
although we operate these computers remotely from our san mateo  california operations center  we do not own or operate the facilities  and we have little control over how these computers are maintained on a day to day basis 
we do not have long term contractual relationships with the companies that operate the facilities where our measurement computers are located 
we may have to find new locations for these computers if we are unable to develop relationships with these companies or if these companies cease their operations as some have done due to bankruptcies or are acquired 
in addition  if our measurement computers cease to function properly  we may not be able to repair or service these computers on a timely basis  as we may not have immediate access to our measurement computers 
our ability to collect data in a timely manner could be impaired if we are unable to maintain and repair our computers should performance problems arise 
others might bring infringement claims against us or our suppliers that could harm our business 
in recent years  there has been significant litigation in the united states involving patents and other intellectual property rights 
we could become subject to intellectual property infringement claims as the number of our competitors grows and our services overlap with competitive offerings 
in addition  we are also subject to other legal proceedings  claims  and litigation arising in the ordinary course of our business 
any of these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert management s attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to others for infringement of their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and to develop noninfringing technology  obtain a license or cease selling the services that contain the infringing intellectual property 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or to obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
our business will be susceptible to additional risks associated with international operations 
we believe we must expand the sales of our services outside the united states 
to date  we have little experience with direct sales outside the united states  and we may not succeed in these efforts 
international sales were approximately and of our total revenue for the years ended september  and  respectively 
we intend to expand the sales of our services by selling directly to certain customers and through resellers to other customers 
therefore  we expect to continue to commit our resources to expand our international sales and marketing activities 
conducting international operations subjects us to risks we do not face in the united states 
these include currency exchange rate fluctuations  seasonal fluctuations in purchasing patterns  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  maintaining and servicing computer hardware in distant locations  longer accounts receivable payment cycles and difficulties in collecting accounts receivable  
table of contents difficulties in managing and staffing international operations  potentially adverse tax consequences  including restrictions on the repatriation of earnings  the burdens of complying with a wide variety of foreign laws  and reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries 
the internet may not be used as widely in other countries and the adoption of e business may evolve slowly or may not evolve at all 
as a result  we may not be successful in selling our services to customers in markets outside the united states 
we may face difficulties assimilating our acquisitions and may incur costs associated with any future acquisitions 
we have completed several acquisitions  and as a part of our business strategy we may seek to acquire or invest in additional businesses  products or technologies that we feel could complement or expand our business  augment our market coverage  enhance our technical capabilities or that may otherwise offer growth opportunities 
future acquisitions could create risks for us  including difficulties in assimilating acquired personnel  operations and technologies  unanticipated costs associated with the acquisition  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  adverse effects on existing business relationships with resellers of our service and our customers  difficulties in managing geographically dispersed businesses  the need to integrate or enhance the systems of an acquired business  impairment charges related to potential write down of acquired assets in acquisitions  failure to realize any of the anticipated benefits of the acquisition  and use of substantial portions of our available cash or dilution in equity if stock is used to consummate the acquisition and or operate the acquired business 
our future operating results could be harmed if we are unable to lease a major portion of the space in our corporate headquarters building or if the fair value of this property decreases further 
we estimate that we will need to lease the unoccupied portion  or approximately  of our headquarters building in san mateo  california 
we may be unable to lease all or a part of the available space  and if it is leased  we may not receive sufficiently high rental rates to cover our building operating costs 
in addition  we have previously incurred a charge for the write down of the building  and  if the real estate market continues to deteriorate  we may incur charges for future write downs 
any such charge could harm our results of operations 
compliance with new rules and regulations concerning corporate governance may be costly and could harm our business 
the sarbanes oxley act  which was signed into law in july  mandates  among other things  that companies adopt new corporate governance measures and imposes comprehensive reporting and disclosure requirements  sets stricter independence and financial expertise standards for audit committee members and imposes increased civil and criminal penalties for companies  their chief executive officers and chief financial officers and directors for securities law violations 
in addition  the nasdaq stock market  on which our common 
table of contents stock is listed  has also adopted additional comprehensive rules and regulations relating to corporate governance 
these laws  rules and regulations will increase the scope  complexity and cost of our corporate governance  reporting and disclosure practices  which could harm our results of operations and divert management s attention from business operations 
we also expect these developments to make it more difficult and more expensive for us to obtain director and officer liability insurance  and we may be required to accept reduced coverage or incur substantially higher costs to obtain coverage 
further  our board members  chief executive officer and chief financial officer could face an increased risk of personal liability in connection with the performance of their duties 
as a result  we may have difficultly attracting and retaining qualified board members and executive officers  which would adversely affect our business 
we have anti takeover protections that may delay or prevent a change in control that could benefit our stockholders 
our amended and restated certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire us without the consent of our board of directors 
these provisions include our stockholders may take action only at a meeting and not by written consent  our board must be given advance notice regarding stockholder sponsored proposals for consideration at annual meetings and for stockholder nominations for the election of directors  and special meetings of our stockholders may be called only by our board of directors  the chairman of the board  our chief executive officer or our president  not by our stockholders 
we have also adopted a stockholder rights plan that may discourage  delay or prevent a change of control and make any future unsolicited acquisition attempt more difficult 
the rights plan was amended on december  the rights will become exercisable only upon the occurrence of certain events specified in the rights plan  including the acquisition of of our outstanding common stock by a person or group 
our board of directors adopted a new policy under which a committee consisting solely of independent directors of the board will review the rights agreement at least once every three years to consider whether maintaining the rights agreement continues to be in the best interests of keynote and our stockholders 
the board may amend the terms of the rights without the approval of the holders of the rights 
item a 
qualitative and quantitative disclosures about market risks 
interest rate sensitivity 
our interest income and expense is sensitive to changes in the general level of us interest rates  particularly because most of our cash  cash equivalents and short term investments are invested in short term debt instruments 
if market interest rates were to change immediately and uniformly by ten percent from levels at september   the interest earned on those cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments could increase or decrease by approximately  on an annualized basis 
foreign currency fluctuations and derivative transactions 
we have not had any significant transactions in foreign currencies  nor do we have any significant balances that are due or payable in foreign currencies at september  we do not enter into derivative transactions for trading or speculative purposes
