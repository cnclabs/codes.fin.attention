item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations operating results sales overall sales declined in driven primarily by sharp declines at the large aerospace segment and at the smaller megtec systems unit of the other products segment 
the effect of these declines was tempered by advances in the propulsion and specialty chemicals segments 
a detailed review of sales for each segment follows 
the decline in sales in the aerospace segment was due primarily to the continuing downturn in the worldwide commercial aviation industry 
engine repair sales declined excluding million of sales of pacific gas turbine pgt  a former equity affiliate which became wholly owned on september   as an increase in sales to the us military and the benefit of translating foreign currency sales into us dollars approximately million was more than offset by the poor conditions in the worldwide commercial airline industry 
the military sales advance was primarily driven by revenues from a contract to provide component repairs at kelly air force base 
sales of original equipment components declined as increases in sales to the industrial turbine and us military markets and a favorable impact of approximately million from translation of foreign currency results to us dollars was more than offset by the weak commercial aviation market 
persistent po or conditions in the airline industry continue to cloud the near term outlook for this unit 
given the outlook for this industry  a recovery to more normal sales levels is not anticipated in the near future 
sales of the propulsion segment increased in sales of rocket motor propulsion systems were ahead due to higher sales of liquid rocket motors for commercial space applications and the benefit of a million technology transfer license payment 
excluding the license payment  sales of propulsion systems were on a par with as new programs offset the absence of contributions from an advanced materials product line sold in may sales of automotive airbag inflators advanced  reflecting increased volumes and the benefit of translating foreign sales into us dollars approximately million  which more than offset an unfavorable shift to lower priced new products 
sales of the metal coating segment declined in  with declines in building and manufactured products tempered by a modest advance in container products 
the year over year decline primarily reflects a decline in the fourth quarter  with sales in each of the three major market segments off from the prior year quarter 
sales to the building products market were down slightly in reflecting weakness in the pre engineered sector of the commercial construction market partially offset by the impact of sales from a former equity affiliate  midwest metal coatings which was consolidated in mid modest advances in sales to the container market were driven by increased demand from the beverage industry while a small decline in sales to the manufactured products area primarily reflects weakness in transportation and lighting sectors 
management expects the building products market to remain soft in the first quarter of sales of the specialty chemicals segment advanced in in local currency due to three principal factors stronger demand for the detergent additive taed  sales added through the june acquisition of a specialty chemicals marketing unit  and the favorable effect of the weakening of the us dollar on the translation of local currency results approximately million 
sales cont d sales of the other products segment declined in  as advances at the automotive products and can machinery units were more than offset by declines at megtec systems and after six 
sales of megtec systems declined excluding sales added by a september acquisition of the roll handling group 
the decline reflects the continuing weak condition of the worldwide graphic arts market 
management does not anticipate improvement in this market in sales of the can machinery unit registered a advance in  with increased sales of the can decorating and specialty can systems product lines more than offsetting lower sales of can forming equipment 
fourth quarter sales more than doubled compared to with all product lines contributing to the advance and the unit finished the year with a strong backlog position 
as a result  management expects that sales in the upcoming quarters will compare favorably to the previous year s comparable periods 
casco pr oducts sales increased in  due primarily to advances at the unit s foreign operations 
sales of the after six formalwear unit declined in  reflecting a drop in demand 
sales in the fourth quarter advanced compared to an unusually low prior year quarter due to a post september th downturn in backlog at this unit doubled compared to the prior year  and management anticipates sales in the first quarter of will be higher than the first quarter of operating income overall operating income increased million or in on an operating basis  significant improvements at the propulsion and specialty chemicals segments and at three of the four units of the other products segment were partially offset by sharp declines at the large aerospace segment and the smaller megtec systems unit of the other products segment as well as increased expenses in the corporate segment 
other major factors in the advance were lower restructuring and related asset impairment charges million in compared with million in  the cessation of goodwill amortization as required by sfas no 
million  and lower environmental clean up provisions million in compared with million in 
the amounts of restructuring and related asset impairment charges recorded in and and the goodwill amortization in are summarized as follows restructuring and related asset impairment charges goodwill amortization aerospace propulsion metal coating specialty chemicals other products megtec sequa can machinery casco products after six corporate a detailed review of operating results by business segment follows operating income cont d operating income in the aerospace segment declined in  as the impact of continuing intense pressure on the commercial airline industry in was tempered by the absence of goodwill amortization  lower restructuring and related asset impairment charges and the favorable effect of translating foreign currency results into us dollars approximately million 
excluding these factors  profits of the chromalloy gas turbine units primarily engaged in engine component repair were unfavorably affected by the following factors the decline in sales to the commercial aviation market  increased inventory provisions primarily related to slow moving inventory  start up costs related to a new unit offering repairs of auxiliary power units and the absence of reserve reversals recorded in these factors were partially offset by the benefits of cost reductions and restructuring actions as well as higher sales to the us military 
results of units primarily engaged in the ma nufacture of original equipment components were also negatively affected by lower volume  an unfavorable sales mix shift and the absence of reserve reversals recorded in  partially offset by a sharp reduction in operating expenses 
in light of the continuing difficulties and intense pricing pressures in the commercial airline market  a return to the pre september  level of operating income is not expected in furthermore  a prolonged decline in the level of air travel will continue to have an adverse impact on chromalloy 
operating income in the propulsion segment was million in  whereas the segment recorded a loss of million in the loss included a million environmental cleanup provision primarily to remediate soil and groundwater contamination from ammonium perchlorate  million of goodwill amortization and asset impairment charges of million million at the domestic airbag inflator operation and million at the propulsion operation 
excluding the impact of these three items  the segment s loss was million  for a million swing in year over year results 
both the propulsion and airbag inflator product lines contributed to the improvement 
the propulsion systems profit advance was primarily driven by profits from the technology transfer license 
the automotive airbag inflator product line narrowed its loss  as a result of increased sales and lower general and administrative costs tempered by lower margins 
operating income in the metal coating segment increased in due primarily to the absence of restructuring and related asset impairment charges and goodwill amortization 
excluding these factors  operating income at the unit advanced as the benefit of improved profitability from ongoing six sigma initiatives and the restructuring program combined with lower natural gas prices to offset the impact of lower sales 
natural gas prices have increased significantly in early  and continuation of the current price levels will have an adverse impact on precoat metal s operating income in later quarters 
the specialty chemicals segment posted improved results in driven by higher sales  operating efficiencies generated from six sigma initiatives and cost containment measures 
the absence of restructuring charges and goodwill amortization and the benefit of favorable currency movements approximately million boosted results further 
the impacts of these factors were tempered by higher pension costs 
results of the specialty chemicals marketing units were ahead for the year primarily due to the june acquisition of a marketing unit 
on an overall basis  profits of this segment for the first quarter of are expected to continue to trend higher  as a result of continuing strong demand from the international detergent market and favorable currency conditions 
operating income cont d the other products segment posted operating profit of million in this segment recorded an operating loss of million in the improvement reflects three factors strong recovery at three of the four operating units in the segment  decreased restructuring and related asset impairment charges  and the absence of goodwill amortization 
partially offsetting these factors was a widening of the loss recorded by the megtec systems unit a million swing excluding the impacts of restructuring and related asset impairment charges and goodwill amortization 
megtec s results reflect the effect of the sharp decline in the worldwide graphic arts market  mitigated by the inclusion of profits from a business acquired in september both years include substantial restructuring charges to curb costs in the tight market environment 
a further restructuring charge estimated at million will result from a plan to streamline its european operations which will b e completed in the can machinery unit posted a profit in the current year  representing a favorable million swing in operating results that was driven by several key factors improved absorption due to a higher level of production  the absence of restructuring charges  the benefits gained from the restructuring program and other cost reduction efforts  the ongoing six sigma program  reduced provisions for slow moving inventory  and improved results at the specialty can systems operations 
the casco automotive products unit posted a profit improvement in the primary reasons for the advance are the absence of restructuring and related asset impairment charges and goodwill amortization in  improved sales at the foreign units  and benefits gained from the restructuring program  including improved cost controls and the outsourcing of certain manufacturing processes 
in order to further reduce costs  management announced plans in early to transfer production from its plan t in bridgeport  connecticut to other facilities 
management anticipates that the move will be completed by mid at an estimated cost of approximately million  which includes costs for severance and relocation 
after six posted a profit in and a loss in the prior year 
the improvement was driven by the benefits of operating efficiencies derived from the restructuring actions and also reflects  reduced bad debt expense and an improved sales mix 
a increase in corporate expenses for  reflects the addition of an accrual for incentive compensation  an increase in pension expense  and a restructuring charge to cover the costs of an early retirement program in  partially offset by lower environmental cleanup provisions in pension expense operating income for includes million of expense related to the periodic net pension cost of all of sequa s significant domestic and foreign funded defined benefit plans 
on an annual basis  sequa reviews the assumptions used in accounting for these plans 
in order to reflect current market conditions  at december   the long term expected rate of return on plan assets was changed from to and the discount rate used to value pension obligations was changed from to 
as a result of these changes and the effect of a decline in the investment performance of its pension portfolios in  management currently anticipates that pension expense in for these plans will double to approximately million  with the largest dollar increases affecting the aerospace  propulsion  specialty chemicals and corporate segments 
interest expense interest expense increased million from due to a first quarter increase in average borrowings  as well as a higher first quarter average interest rate 
the increased rate resulted from the repayment of lower rate revolving credit debt using a portion of the proceeds of the million senior notes issued on april  interest income interest income decreased million from  primarily due to lower interest rates and the absence of earnings on a portion of the proceeds of the million senior notes issued on april  that had been temporarily invested 
equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures sequa has investments in a number of unconsolidated joint ventures  which amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the combination of income and losses of these joint ventures was losses of million in and million in chromalloy is a partner in joint ventures aimed at strengthening its ties to certain original equipment manufacturers and airline customers  as well as ensuring close cooperation with respect to the dissemination of technical specifications and requirements 
sequa s investment in chromalloy s joint ventures was million and million at december  and  respectively 
the combination of income and losses of chromalloy s joint ventures was income of million in and million in the largest of the chromalloy joint ventures are discussed in the following paragraphs 
in december  chromalloy signed an agreement with siemens westinghouse power corporation and siemens aktiengesellschaft collectively referred to as siemens to establish a global cooperation consisting of joint ownership of certain operating companies 
these operating companies will provide service and repairs for heavy industrial gas turbines manufactured by other companies or for gas turbines based on the mature technologies of siemens and its affiliates 
the agreement has been approved by the european commission which reviews mergers  acquisitions and joint ventures  and it is anticipated that the agreement will be effective in the second quarter of chromalloy has a ownership interest in turbine airfoil coating repair llc tacr  an existing joint venture with siemens 
tacr coats new parts and repairs components of industrial gas turbines primarily for siemens 
chromalloy has a ownership interest in masaood john brown ltd mjb  a partnership with mohammed bin masaood sons  which provides repair and maintenance services for industrial gas turbines from a facility in the united arab emirates 
at december   sequa has guaranteed mjb s bank line of credit in the amount of million 
chromalloy has a ownership interest  which does not equate to a controlling interest  in a component manufacturing operation that produces new replacement parts for jet engines 
while chromalloy s partners in this joint venture are major commercial airlines  whose industry has been under significant pressures  management believes that the venture is adequately capitalized 
equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures cont d chromalloy has two joint ventures with rolls royce plc turbine surface technologies ltd tst  which will provide advanced coatings for rolls royce turbine components  and turbine repair technologies ltd trt  which provides advanced component repair services for certain rolls royce engines 
tst is expected to generate sales in advanced coatings technologies act  a owned joint venture with united technologies corporation  owns and operates an electron beam ceramic coater for the application of pratt whitney coatings to jet engine parts 
on september   chromalloy acquired the remaining ownership interest in pacific gas turbine center  llc pgt  which overhauls and tests certain jet engines 
the acquired assets and liabilities of pgt and the results of operations have been consolidated with those of sequa from the acquisition date 
other  net in  other  net included million of gain related to the change in the fair market value of a gas swap  million of income related to insurance litigation settlements concerning certain product liability claims relating to the closed operations of a predecessor company  million of gain on the sale of a former joint venture engaged in the marketing of electric propulsion subsystems for satellites  million of gain on the fair market value of forward foreign exchange contracts that did not qualify for cash flow hedge accounting  million of gain on the sale of stock received from the demutualization of an issuer of corporate owned life insurance policies and pension annuities  million of charges for the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs  million of expense on the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance  million of discount expense on the sale of accounts receivable  and million of charges for letters of credit and commitment fees 
in  other  net included million of income related to the demutualization of an issuer of corporate owned life insurance policies and pension annuities  million of gain on the sale of the caval tool division of the chromalloy gas turbine subsidiary  million of discount expense related to the sale of accounts receivable  million of expense on the fair market valuation of a natural gas swap and related option  million of charges for the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs  million of expense on the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance  and million of charges for letters of credit and commitment fees 
income tax benefit provision the income tax benefit of million includes million of tax benefit  related to an increase in domestic net operating loss carryforwards due to the resolution of issues and the related completion of an internal revenue service audit  and million of income relating to the reversal of income tax reserves no longer required  due to the completion of tax audits at two foreign units 
the effect of these items is to increase basic earnings per share by and  respectively 
tax settlement in  the irs notified sequa that a settlement agreement concerning the restructuring of two subsidiaries was approved 
as a result of the settlement  million  representing the reversal of reserves no longer required  was recorded as income through a reduction of the income tax provision 
the amount is separately identified in the consolidated statement of operations 
the impact of the settlement was to increase basic earnings per share by in effect of a change in accounting principle on january   sequa adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

the statement changed the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
sequa completed the transitional impairment review required under sfas no 
and recorded a non cash charge of million net of a related tax benefit on deductible goodwill of million as the effect of a change in accounting principle in the consolidated statement of operations 
the fair values of sequa s reporting units were measured using an income approach based on a present value technique of estimated expected future cash flows 
the transitional charge relates to the missile and space propulsion million and automotive inflator million reporting units of the propulsion segment and the megtec systems million and after six million reporting units of the other products segment 
the effect of the change in accounting principle reduced basic earnings per share by for the year ended december  further information regarding the impact of this statement is contained in note to the consolidated financial statements 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill is to be reviewed for impairment on an annual basis 
the review date may coincide with the anniversary of the implementation date january or another date may be selected 
sequa has selected october as the date for subsequent reviews 
sequa reviewed its goodwill as of october  and determined that no further impairment of goodwill had occurred 
loss from discontinued operations sequa s investment in discontinued operations primarily relates to a leveraged lease portfolio that will be liquidated over the next years as rentals are received and residual values are realized 
the leveraged lease cash flow stream  excluding estimated residual values  services the payment of principal and interest on a non recourse loan that securitized the lease portfolio 
sequa s investment in the leveraged lease portfolio is subject to risks associated with the ultimate realizability of estimated residual values as well as the continuing creditworthiness of the various lessees 
certain of the leases concern aircraft leased to major commercial airlines including one with united airlines ual 
in december  ual filed a voluntary petition for reorganization under chapter of the united states bankruptcy code chapter 
in december  sequa recorded an million after tax charge of which million relates to the write off of the net investment in the ual lease 
the balance of the after tax charge relates to a permanent decline in the realizability of remaining aircraft residual values 
the effect of the after tax charge from discontinued operations reduced basic earnings per share by 
risk concentration of business sequa s largest operation  chromalloy gas turbine corporation  with sales and operating income of million and million  respectively  and total assets at december  of million  has experienced significant difficulties in its operating environment since the terrorist attacks of september   which had a severe  immediate and extended impact on the airline industry compounded by a general economic slowdown 
the downturn in air travel has had a significant impact on both chromalloy s repair  and original equipment component manufacturing operations which derived approximately of their sales from the commercial aviation market 
the large repair business is directly related to the number of hours jet engines are flown and the original equipment component manufacturing business is related to the number of new jet engines placed in service 
the economic impact on chromalloy has been partially offset by cost cutting measures 
in light of the continuing difficulties a nd intense pricing pressures in the commercial airline market  a return to the pre september  level of operating income is not expected in furthermore  a prolonged decline in the level of air travel will continue to have an adverse impact on the operations of chromalloy and on its joint ventures million investment at december  that serve the airline industry 
in march  standard poor s ratings services s p placed its ratings on airlines on creditwatch with negative implications 
s p cited the looming war with iraq and its estimation that already weak airlines will incur substantial losses and cash outflow  due to declines in air travel 
at february   trade receivables due from major commercial airlines totaled approximately million 
the poor business conditions in the airline industry and the possibility of bankruptcy filings by other carriers who are customers of chromalloy could adversely affect the ability of chromalloy to realize some of these receivables 
ual  which filed chapter in december  accounted for approximately million or of chromalloy s sales in of sales 
the pre petition net trade accounts receivable balance is nominal 
the impact of the ual filing on chromalloy s operations is uncertain at this time 
chromalloy competes for turbine engine repair business with a number of other companies  including the oems 
the oems generally have obligations contractual and otherwise to approve vendors to perform repair services on their engines and components 
chromalloy has a number of such approvals  including licensing agreements  which allow it to repair certain components of flight engines 
the loss of a major oem s approval to repair components for its engines could have an adverse effect on chromalloy  although management believes it has certain actions available to it to mitigate this effect 
sequa is engaged in the automotive airbag inflator business through arc 
arc s largest customer for airbag inflators is breed and its subsidiaries which are supplied under long term contracts 
breed and its subsidiaries accounted for million or of arc s sales in and million or of sales in risk concentration of business cont d precoat metals markets its coating services to steel and aluminum producers and distributors  building products manufacturers  merchant can makers and manufacturers of other diverse products 
the steel manufacturers have experienced difficult economic pressures and the industry is undergoing a period of consolidation 
precoat metals has worked to insulate its accounts receivable exposure 
furthermore  precoat metals primarily acts as a toll coater for its steel mill customers and therefore does not own significant stores of coil inventory to serve this market 
on march   national steel filed chapter national steel is precoat metals largest customer  accounting for approximately million or of sales of sales 
the pre petition trade receivable balance with national steel was nominal and precoat metal s operations have not been adversely impacted 
ak steel has been granted stalking horse rights by the bankruptcy court for the purchase of national steel s assets contingent on ak steel reaching a new labor agreement with the united steel workers of america 
us steel has also indicated its interest in acquiring national steel s assets should ak steel be unsuccessful in its negotiations 
sequa s investment in discontinued operations primarily relates to a leveraged lease portfolio that is subject to risks associated with the ultimate realizability of estimated residual values as well as the creditworthiness of the lessees 
several of the leases are for aircraft leased to major commercial airlines including one with ual 
in december  sequa recorded an million after tax charge related to its investment in the ual lease as well as a permanent reduction in other aircraft residuals 
in february  american airlines  inc aa issued a term sheet to parties involved in its leveraged lease financings as part of a process to implement a consensual restructuring of its obligations to its stakeholders 
the term sheet outlines net present value savings that aa is seeking as part of its restructuring 
management does not believe that the aa term sheet is indicative of the value the leveraged lease arrangement provides to aa and  it is premature to estima te the impact on sequa s investment in discontinued operations of a potential bankruptcy by aa 
at december   sequa s remaining investment in aircraft leases with major commercial airlines is million of which million relates to aa 
derivative and other financial instruments sequa is exposed to market risk from changes in foreign currency exchange rates and from changes in the prices of certain commodities which impact its earnings  cash flows and financial condition 
sequa manages its exposure to this market risk through its regular operating and financial activities and  when appropriate  through the use of derivative financial instruments 
sequa has established a control environment which assigns senior executives and in certain instances operational management responsibility for risk assessment and the approval  reporting and monitoring of derivative financial instrument activities 
sequa does not buy  hold or sell derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
sequa s primary foreign currency exposures relate to the british pound and to the euro 
to mitigate the short term effect of changes in currency exchange rates  sequa utilizes forward foreign exchange contracts and derivatives thereof  to manage its exposure to certain existing assets and liabilities and to hedge firm commitments and forecasted transactions denominated in currencies other than the derivative and other financial instruments cont d functional currency 
depending on the volatility of the market  sequa utilizes natural gas swap agreements to convert a portion of its natural gas requirements to fixed rates 
depending on the use of a derivative and whether it has been designated and qualifies as an efficient hedge  gains and losses resulting from changes in the value of the derivative are recognized currently in earnings or reported in accumulated other comprehensive income loss  a separate component of shareholders equity 
a hypothetical uniform decrease in all foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar would have decreased the fair value of sequa s financial instruments by approximately million as of december  and million as of december  the sensitivity analysis relates only to sequa s exchange rate sensitive financial instruments  which include cash and debt amounts denominated in foreign currencies and all open foreign forward exchange contracts at december  and the effect of this hypothetical change in exchange rates ignores the effect this movement may have on the value of net assets  other than financial instruments  denominated in foreign currencies and does not consider the effect this movement may have on anticipated foreign currency cash flows 
at december  and  substantially all of sequa s debt was at fixed rates  and sequa currently does not hold interest rate derivative contracts 
accordingly  a change in market interest rates would not materially impact sequa s interest expense but would affect the fair value of sequa s debt 
generally  the fair market value of fixed rate debt increases as interest rates fall and decreases as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of sequa s total debt was approximately million at december  and million at december  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would have decreased the fair value of sequa s total debt by approximately million at december  and million at december  a hypothetical decrease in interest rates would have increased the fair value of sequa s total debt by approximately million at december  and million at december  the fair value of sequa s total d ebt is based primarily upon quoted market prices of sequa s publicly traded securities 
the estimated changes in the fair values of sequa s debt are based upon changes in the present value of future cash flows as derived from the hypothetical changes in market interest rates 
environmental matters sequa s environmental department  under senior management s direction  manages all activities related to sequa s involvement in environmental cleanup 
this department establishes the projected range of expenditures for individual sites with respect to which sequa may be considered a potentially responsible party under applicable federal or state laws 
these projected expenditures  which are reviewed periodically  include remedial investigation and feasibility studies  outside legal  consulting and remediation project management fees  the projected cost of remediation activities  and site closure and post remediation monitoring costs 
the assessments take into account currently available facts  existing technology  presently enacted laws  past expenditures  and other potentially responsible parties and their probable level of involvement 
outside technical  scientific and legal consulting services are used to support management s assessments of costs at significant individual sites 
environmental matters cont d it is sequa s policy to accrue environmental remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
in the fourth quarter of  sequa recorded a charge of million to increase its accruals for remediation costs 
the charge included million of estimated cost to remediate soil and groundwater contamination from ammonium perchlorate ap  a raw material used to produce missile and rocket fuel 
although no federal or state environmental standards have been finalized for ap  recent studies indicating that the chemical may interfere with human thyroid function have prompted sequa to begin cleanup actions at its solid propellant facilities 
at december   the potential exposure for all remediation costs is estimated to range from million to million  and sequa s consolidated balance sheet includes accruals for remediation costs of million 
these accruals are at undiscounted amounts and are included in accrued expenses and other noncurrent liabilities 
actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures 
with respect to all known environmental liabilities  sequa s actual cash expenditures for remediation of previously contaminated sites were million in  million in and million in sequa anticipates that remedial cash expenditures will be between million and million during and between million and million during sequa s capital expenditures for projects to eliminate  control or dispose of pollutants were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
sequa anticipates annual environment related capital expenditures to be approximately million during and million during sequa s operating expenses to eliminate  control and dispose of pollutants were approximately million in  million in and million in sequa anticipates that environmental operating expenses will be approximately million per year during and backlog the businesses of sequa for which backlogs are significant are the turbine airfoils  turbocombustor technology and castings units of the aerospace segment  the solid and liquid rocket motor operations of the propulsion segment  and the sequa can machinery  megtec and after six units of the other products segment 
the aggregate dollar amount of backlog in these units was million at december  and million at december  increases in backlog at the propulsion segment  sequa can machinery and after six were partially offset by a decline at megtec 
sales of after six are seasonal  with stronger sales in the first six months of the year  accordingly  this unit s backlog is normally higher at december than at any other time of the year 
liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared with million in higher operating income levels and a decrease in taxes paid  which included a federal tax refund received in  were more than offset by increased working capital requirements primarily related to pension contributions 
cash used for investing activities was million liquidity and capital resources cont d in  compared with million in the million increased usage primarily relates to the proceeds on the sale of the caval tool division of the chromalloy gas turbine subsidiary in net cash from financing activities was million in  compared with million in the million decrease reflects the million net proceeds from the april debt offering and subsequent repayment in of amounts outstanding under sequa s medium term note issue  revolving credit and receivables purchase agreements  as well as an increase in receivables sold in net cash provided by the effect of exchange rate changes was million in  compared with million used in the million increase primarily reflects the strengthening of the british pound and the euro relative to the us dollar in from and a modest weakening of these same currencies relative to the us dollar in from in january  sequa cancelled its million revolving credit agreement 
adverse economic conditions precluded sequa from being in compliance with certain financial covenants of the agreement in the fourth quarter of  and the facility was not used during that period 
sequa has held intermittent discussions with a group of banks regarding a new secured credit facility  however  given the sufficient level of liquidity  management has chosen not to enter into a new agreement at this time 
in the third quarter of  fitch ratings downgraded the senior unsecured debt of sequa to bb from bb and revised its rating outlook to negative from stable 
fitch ratings cited sequa s weakened financial performance over the previous months  the cyclical nature of each of sequa s businesses  particularly commercial aerospace  and the underfunded status of sequa s defined benefit pension plans 
in the second quarter of  standard poor s lowered its long term corporate credit and senior unsecured debt ratings on sequa to bb from bb 
in march  s p placed its ratings on commercial aviation suppliers  including sequa  on creditwatch with negative implications 
s p cited the looming war with iraq as likely to have a significant impact on commercial aviation which  in turn  would put additonal pressures on companies serving that industry 
the absence of a revolving credit agreement and the downgrade in debt ratings have impacted sequa s ability to issue new unsecured letters of credit and surety bonds for financial guarantees 
while sequa s letters of credit generally renew on an annual  evergreen basis  it is possible that some issuers may require collateral in the future 
in december  sequa deposited million with an insurance carrier when the surety market for financial guarantees became extremely tight and sequa was unable to renew a surety bond 
the amount is being held in an interest bearing account as cash collateral against future expected claims and is refundable upon the issuance of a letter of credit 
at december   sequa was contingently liable for million of outstanding letters of credit and million of surety bonds not reflected in the accompanying consolidated balance sheet 
in addition  sequa has guaranteed a million bank line of credit for its mjb joint venture 
sequa is not currently aware of any existing conditions that would cause risk of loss relative to the outstanding letters of credit  surety bonds or the guarantee 
liquidity and capital resources cont d sequa receivables corp 
src  a wholly owned special purpose corporation  has a receivables purchase agreement extending through november under which it may sell up to million of an undivided percentage ownership interest in sequa s eligible trade receivables through a bank sponsored facility 
under the terms of the agreement  src s assets will be available to satisfy its obligations to its creditors  which have security interests in certain of src s assets  prior to any distribution to sequa 
management has held preliminary discussions regarding a renewal of the facility and expects that an agreement will be in place  similar in terms and in an amount commensurate with underlying receivables balances  upon the expiration of the current receivables purchase agreement 
alternatively  subject to liquidity requirements  a new secured bank credit facility may replace the receivables purchase agreement and provide for additional funds including the issuance of letters of credit 
in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities a replacement of fasb statement no 
 transactions under the receivables purchase agreement qualify as a sale of receivables 
trade receivables included in the december  consolidated balance sheet are net of million of receivables sold under the agreement 
capital expenditures amounted to million in  with spending concentrated in the aerospace  propulsion and metal coating segments 
these funds were primarily used to upgrade existing facilities and equipment and to expand airbag inflator capacity 
sequa currently anticipates that capital spending in will be approximately million and will be concentrated in the aerospace and propulsion segments 
in  sequa contributed million to its domestic qualified defined benefit pension plans 
due to the present underfunded status of these plans  management anticipates that additional pension contributions will total approximately million in the next months and will be contributed primarily in the third quarter of due to declines in the equity markets as well as lower interest rates utilized to value year end pension liabilities  sequa recorded a million after tax fourth quarter charge through other comprehensive income  a component of shareholders equity  to increase pension liabilities to required levels in the consolidated balance sheet 
in october  sequa purchased and cancelled million of its senior notes due in management regarded the purchase to be at a satisfactory price 
although sequa has no formal plan to purchase its outstanding notes or other securities  management may  depending on market conditions and other factors  from time to time  purchase its notes or other securities in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions 
management currently anticipates that cash flow from operations  the million available at march  under the receivables purchase agreement and the agreement s expected fourth quarter renewal in an amount commensurate with underlying receivable balances or  alternatively  subject to liquidity requirements  a new secured bank credit facility that may replace the receivables purchase agreement and provide for additional funds including the issuance of letters of credit  and the million of cash and cash equivalents on hand at february  will be sufficient to fund sequa s operations for including the million of interest payments due on the outstanding and senior notes  million of estimated capital expenditures  the million of estimated pension contributions  and any future requirements of collateral on letters of credit and surety bonds which totaled million at february  significant accounting policies and estimates sequa believes that the application of the following accounting policies is important to its financial position and results of operations and requires significant judgments and estimates on the part of management 
for a summary of all of sequa s significant accounting policies see note to the consolidated financial statements included on pages through of this annual report on form k 
allowance for doubtful accounts certain of sequa s operating segments provide services to industries that are or have been experiencing difficult economic pressures 
the aerospace segment performs repair and other services for the commercial airline industry and the metal coating segment counts major steel mills among its customers 
see the risk concentration of business section of this md a on pages and of this annual report on form k for further discussion 
many of sequa s customers are large  well known companies  and the customer base is monitored through a review of account balance agings  an assessment of customer financial condition  and interactions with the customers 
reserves are established through a combination of specific identification of problem accounts and percentages of aging brackets 
inventory reserves the aerospace segment chromalloy gas turbine maintains significant inventories of parts to serve the repair market 
in order to ensure that any obsolete or slow moving inventory is properly identified and valued  chromalloy has in place a policy that mandates minimum reserve requirements based on usage 
the policy provides for a consistent and systematic approach to valuing inventory  with reserves reassessed quarterly and at year end for adequacy 
management believes that  while demand for certain repair services and manufactured parts has been volatile during the past year and can remain volatile while the industry is disrupted  the long term outlook for the industry is positive 
however  a further decline in air travel would have an adverse impact on inventory reserve requirements 
revenue recognition the propulsion segment is engaged in the military contract market to produce propulsion systems primarily for tactical weapons 
long term contracts are accounted for on the percentage of completion method  whereby sales are primarily recognized based upon costs incurred as a percentage of estimated total costs and gross profits are recognized under a more conservative efforts expended method  primarily based upon direct labor costs incurred as a percentage of estimated total direct labor costs 
changes in estimates for sales  costs and gross profit are recognized in the period in which they are determinable using the cumulative catch up method 
goodwill sfas no 
requires that goodwill and other intangible assets be tested for impairment on an annual basis 
sequa recorded a million after tax transitional impairment charge effective with the january  adoption of sfas no 
sequa updated its review of goodwill on its selected annual test date of october  and noted no further impairment 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  assumptions are made with respect to future business conditions and estimated expected future cash flows to determine the fair value of a reporting unit 
if these goodwill cont d estimates and assumptions change in the future due to such factors as a decline in general economic conditions  a long term or permanent decline in air travel  competitive pressures on sales and margins  and other factors beyond management s controls  an impairment charge may be required 
details of remaining goodwill balances by segment are included in note to the consolidated financial statements on page of this annual report on form k and is incorporated herein by reference 
income taxes sequa has significant domestic net operating loss carryforwards  as well as deferred tax assets established through other comprehensive income in recording a minimum required pension liability 
management believes that such carryforwards and deferred tax assets will be utilized before their expiration through future reversals of existing taxable temporary differences  future earnings and available tax planning strategies 
sequa s ability to generate the expected amounts of domestic taxable income from future operations is dependent upon general economic conditions  the state of the airline industry and other major markets  competitive pressures on sales and margins  and other factors beyond management s control 
there can be no assurance that sequa will meet its expectations for future domestic taxable income in the carryforward period or that available tax strategies can be enacted 
however  management has considered the above factors in reaching the conclusion that it is more l ikely than not that future domestic taxable income and available tax strategies will be sufficient to fully realize the domestic operating loss carryforwards and deferred tax assets at december  environmental sequa s environmental department  under senior management s direction  manages all activities related to sequa s involvement in environmental cleanup 
this department establishes the projected range of expenditures for individual sites with respect to which sequa may be considered a potentially responsible party under applicable federal or state laws 
these projected expenditures  which are reviewed periodically  include remedial investigation and feasibility studies  outside legal  consulting and remediation project management fees  the projected cost of remediation activities  and site closure and post remediation monitoring costs 
the assessments take into account currently available facts  existing technology  presently enacted laws  past expenditures  and other potentially responsible parties and their probable level of involvement 
outside technical  scientific and legal consulting services are used to support management s assessments of costs at significant individual sites 
it is sequa s policy to accrue environmental remediation costs for identified sites when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
actual costs to be incurred at identified sites in future periods may vary from the estimates  given inherent uncertainties in evaluating environmental exposures 
other information statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas no

while the statement does not require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  it does require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim statements 
sequa currently follows accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 which measures compensation cost for stock options as the excess  if any  of the quoted market price of a company s stock at the grant date over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the stock 
as sequa s stock option plans require the option p rice to be no less than the fair market value at the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized for stock options granted

operating results sales overall sales of billion for were virtually unchanged from advances at the propulsion and metal coating segments were offset by slight declines in the aerospace and specialty chemicals segments and by a sharper decline in the other products segment 
a detailed review of sales for each segment follows 
sales of the aerospace segment declined in on a pro forma basis to exclude the prior year s sales from operations contributed to joint ventures during  and the sales of caval tool  which was divested on february  aerospace sales advanced 
engine component repair sales advanced in  despite the absence of sales from units contributed to joint ventures million and the unfavorable effect of translating foreign sales to us dollars approximately million 
the advance in the repair segment reflects higher sales to the commercial airline market and the industrial gas turbine market 
in the fourth quarter of  sales to the repair market declined  primarily due to the impact on the commercial airlines of the september terrorist attacks 
the impact on sales was partially offset by work already in house 
sales to the original equipment market declined in  a reflection of the divestiture of caval tool millio n impact  weak market conditions  and the unfavorable effect of translating foreign sales to us dollars approximately million 
sales of the propulsion segment increased in  as sales of automotive airbag inflators rose due to the february  acquisition by an arc affiliate of certain assets and the automotive inflator business of bag spa  an italian operation that was previously owned by arc 
domestic automotive inflator sales declined because of the absence of sales to bag spa in the last months of propulsion sales were on a par with sales of the metal coating segment increased in  primarily driven by a strong advance in sales to the building products market  and the consolidation of a former equity affiliate  midwest metal coatings mmc  for the last seven months of the increase in building products primarily reflects market share gains and strong demand from the component segment of the market 
sales to the container market registered a small advance  as the benefit derived from the temporary shutdown of coating capacity at a customer s facility more than offset general weakness in the container market 
sales to the manufactured products market were on a par with the prior year 
the fourth quarter was particularly strong for the metal coating segment  with double digit increases in sales to each of the major markets served 
sales of the specialty chemicals segment declined in  as a increase in local currency sales was more than offset by the translation of local currency amounts to us dollars 
the local currency increase was due entirely to the addition of two specialty chemicals marketing units acquired in and sales of detergent chemicals declined for the year  though a rebound in fourth quarter demand tempered the impact of mid year market weakness 
the marketing units were unfavorably affected by the weak euro and a softening in demand which began in the second quarter 
sales cont d sales of the other products segment declined in  with each of the major units down from the preceding year 
sales of megtec systems declined excluding sales from the recently acquired roll handling group  with lower sales to all major markets graphic arts  emission controls  and industrial products 
fourth quarter sales declined excluding the impact of the roll handling group reflecting both very weak market conditions and the effect of comparison against a particularly strong fourth quarter of backlog at year end was down from year end  primarily reflecting weakness in demand from the graphic arts market 
sales of sequa can machinery declined in with lower sales to the can forming and decorating equipment and spare parts markets tempered by a increase in specialty can systems 
sales at automotive supplier casco products declined  due primarily to a significant decline in sales to the north american market 
foreign un its registered a small advance  as local currency increases were tempered by the impact of the stronger dollar on translation of the results million 
sales of the men s apparel unit  after six  declined for the year and for the fourth quarter  due to a sharp decline in demand for formalwear 
backlog at this unit was down from year end operating income overall operating income declined million or in the major elements in the decline were restructuring and related asset impairment charges of million million higher than in  a million provision for environmental clean up million higher than in  and an unfavorable swing in results exclusive of the restructuring and environmental provisions of million in the propulsion segment and million in the other products segment 
a detailed review of operating results for each segment follows 
operating income in the aerospace segment declined in results for include a restructuring charge of million and related asset impairment charges of million 
these costs were for a person approximately reduction in chromalloy gas turbine s workforce and the closing of a small facility 
on a pro forma basis to exclude these charges  operating income increased in the segment benefited from the absence of product development costs million in the first six months of at a component manufacturing unit now treated as an equity investment  and improved profitability at units engaged primarily in oem activities 
these benefits were tempered by lower profits at units primarily engaged in component repair for both the commercial airlines and industrial gas turbine aftermarkets 
while declines at these repair units in the first nine months were due entirely to the absence of approximately million of operating income from busine ss transferred to joint ventures in  the fourth quarter decline reflected the dislocations in the commercial airline market following the september  terrorist attacks  partially offset by cost cutting actions and the resolution of certain contractual matters and cost estimates which allowed previously established reserves of million to be reversed 
the propulsion segment reported a million loss in  compared with a million profit in the unfavorable swing primarily reflects losses at the automotive airbag inflator operations  a fourth quarter environmental cleanup provision of million  million in asset impairment charges and a decline in profits in the rocket motor propulsion unit 
losses at operating income cont d the automotive airbag inflator operations primarily reflect three major factors the consolidation of the italian inflator operation beginning february   an unfavorable shift in the mix of domestic airbag inflator sales  and a million asset impairment charge 
the million provision for environmental cleanup was primarily related to the establishment of a million reserve to remediate soil and groundwater contamination from ammonium perchlorate ap  a raw material used in the production of solid rocket motor propellant 
although no federal or applicable state environmental standards have been finalized for ap  studies indicating that the chemical may interfere with human thyroid function prompted the unit to begin cleanup actions at its two affected solid propellant facilities 
excluding the environmental provision  the decline in operating profit in the rocket propulsion portion of the business is primarily related to a million asset impairment charge  and to lower margins in the liquid propulsion market primarily caused by cost overruns on a commercial satellite program in the second half of operating income in the metal coating segment declined or million in the decline was due entirely to million of restructuring and related asset impairment charges to cover an early retirement program and the closing of a coating facility in chicago  illinois 
excluding these charges  results for were on a par with  as strong operating results in the second half of the year offset the effect of a poor first quarter 
on an operating basis  a increase in sales without the impact of mmc  the earnings added by the newly acquired mmc unit  improved productivity and income from a consulting agreement were offset by higher natural gas pricing approximately million and by weakness in the secondary metal market 
operating income in the specialty chemicals segment declined in both years were affected by restructuring charges related to early retirement programs million in and million in 
the decline was primarily due to lower profits at the marketing units  where the benefits of higher sales were largely offset by currency driven margin pressures and weakness in a key product market  increased pension expense  and the impact of a declining pound sterling on reported us dollar results 
at the larger detergent chemicals operation  the benefits of restructuring and other ongoing cost containment initiatives were largely offset by slightly lower sales and higher raw material costs 
the impact on operating income of restructuring charges  net of same year savings  was roughly equivalent in both years 
the other products segment posted a million loss in  whereas this segment had operating income of million in each of the four operating units recorded losses in  whereas each recorded profits in of the million swing in operating results  million reflects restructuring actions taken at the four units 
megtec had an unfavorable million swing in operating results  which included a million restructuring charge to reduce the work force by 
without this charge the unit was at approximately breakeven in  due to the impact of a sharp decline in sales in the fourth quarter and a shift to lower margined products 
the sequa can machinery operation registered an unfavorable swing of million in operating results 
this was primarily attributable to restructuring and related asset impairment charges of million for headcount reductions and the closing of a facility  the impact of lower sales and a significantly lo wer level of manufacturing activity in can forming and decorating products on absorption and gross profit  increased provisions for slow moving inventory  and lower spare parts sales 
casco  the automotive products unit  recorded an operating income cont d million unfavorable swing in operating results in this included a restructuring charge of million and related asset impairment charges of million to cover the impact of headcount reductions and the write down of equipment used in processes being outsourced 
the balance of the decline is attributable to a loss at the domestic operation  where sales declined sharply and pressure on costs and margins continued 
results at after six  the men s apparel unit  were down million  primarily due to a drop in sales  manufacturing inefficiencies  and increased inventory markdowns and bad debt provisions 
restructuring and related asset impairment charges totaled million for this unit  which resulted from the decision to manufacture a large portion of the unit s products offshore 
corporate expenses declined in  primarily a reflection of the absence of a bonus accrual  partially offset by increased environmental cleanup provisions for operations that are no longer part of sequa million in  million in and higher pension costs 
interest expense interest expense increased million from and reflects a higher level of average borrowings due to expanded working capital needs at sequa s chromalloy unit resulting from growth initiatives pursued in as well as other general corporate purposes 
the increase also reflects a higher average interest rate resulting from the repayment of revolving credit debt using a portion of the proceeds of the million senior notes 
equity in loss of unconsolidated joint ventures sequa s investments in unconsolidated joint ventures amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the combination of income and losses of these joint ventures resulted in net equity losses of million in and million in the largest of these joint ventures are discussed in the following paragraphs 
on february   arc  through an affiliate  acquired certain assets and the ongoing automotive airbag inflator business of bag spa pursuant to an overall settlement agreement with its former joint venture partner  breed technologies  inc the results of operations as they relate to the acquired assets and the ongoing inflator business of bag spa have been fully consolidated with those of sequa from the acquisition date 
sequa continues to have an equity investment in bag spa reflecting underlying assets established for certain anticipated liabilities as the venture is wound down 
sequa s investment in bag spa was million at december  and million at december  sequa s equity share of the losses of the bag spa joint venture was million in and million in the loss includes a million write down of an airbag inflator production line 
chromalloy has investments in a number of unconsolidated joint ventures  which amounted to million and million at december  and  respectively 
the combination of income and losses of these joint ventures resulted in net equity income of million in and net equity losses of million in in june  precoat metals acquired the remaining ownership interest in midwest metal coatings mmc  which coats coils of heavy gauge steel for structural components used in the building products market 
the results of operations have been fully consolidated with those of sequa from the acquisition date 
sequa s investment in mmc was million at december  sequa s equity share of net income from mmc was million in and million in other  net in  other  net included million of income related to the demutualization of an issuer of corporate owned life insurance policies and pension annuities  million of gain on the sale of the caval tool division of the chromalloy gas turbine subsidiary  million of discount expense related to the sale of accounts receivable  million of expense on the fair market valuation of a natural gas swap and related option  million of charges for the amortization of capitalized debt issuance costs  million of expense on the cash surrender value of corporate owned life insurance  and million of charges for letters of credit and commitment fees

liquidity and capital resources net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared with million in the primary reasons for the million increase were a lower level of working capital requirements partly offset by lower operating income and an increase in taxes paid that primarily reflects the absence of a federal tax refund received in cash used for investing activities was million in  compared with million in the million decrease primarily relates to the proceeds on the sale of the caval tool division of the chromalloy gas turbine subsidiary  and a lower level of capital spending in net cash from financing activities was million in  compared with million in the million decrease reflects the million net proceeds from the april debt offering and the subsequent repayment of the million medium term notes due in mid may and amounts outstanding under sequa s revolving credit and receivables purchase agr eements 
on april   sequa completed an offering of million of senior notes due april  through a private placement under rule a of the securities act of  as amended the securities act 
net proceeds received on april  from the senior notes offering amounted to million 
the proceeds were used to repay approximately million outstanding under sequa s revolving credit agreement  to redeem million of medium term notes when they matured in mid may  and for general corporate purposes including a reduction in the amount outstanding under the receivables purchase agreement 
concurrent with the completion of the senior notes offering  sequa s revolving credit facility was reduced to million from million
