item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with selected financial data and our financial statements and the related notes included elsewhere in this filing 
overview bone care is a specialty pharmaceutical company engaged in discovering  developing and commercializing improved vitamin d hormone therapies to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with kidney or renal disease  and other diseases  including osteoporosis  psoriasis and cancers of the prostate  breast and colon 
we were founded in as a subsidiary of lunar corporation  located in madison  wisconsin  and we were spun off from lunar in we licensed our first product  doxercalciferol or hectorol  as it is known commercially  in from the university of wisconsin  a leading vitamin d research center 
hectorol is a vitamin d hormone replacement therapy approved by the fda in two formulations to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients with end stage renal disease  or esrd 
hectorol is a safe and effective therapy for reducing elevated levels of parathyroid hormone pth in blood in the management of secondary hyperparathyroidism  a disease characterized by excessive secretion of pth 
hyperparathyroidism  if left untreated  can eventually result in cardiovascular compromise  reduced immunity  muscle weakness  bone loss and fractures 
virtually all esrd patients suffer from secondary hyperparathyroidism 
we obtained fda approval for hectorol capsules in june  and we began selling this orally administered product in the us in october we obtained fda approval for hectorol injection in april  and we launched this intravenous product in the us in august  and we received a national medicare reimbursement code for hectorol injection in january we are also developing doxercalciferol and other vitamin d hormones to treat several other diseases 
we filed a supplemental new drug application with the fda in december to treat secondary hyperparathyroidism in chronic kidney disease ckd patients 
we received an approvable letter from fda in october  for which we have provided our response 
if approved  this would expand the approved indications for hectorol capsules 
from our inception in  we have generated minimal revenue from operations  and from our inception substantially all of our resources have been dedicated to o the development  patenting  pre clinical testing  and clinical trials of hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  o the development of manufacturing processes for hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  o pursuing us regulatory approvals of hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  o the sales and marketing associated with the launch of hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  and o research and development and pre clinical testing of other potential product candidates 
we have lost money since inception and  as of june  have an accumulated deficit of approximately million 
our only sources of revenue have been o revenues from the launch of hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  o licensing fees associated with our early stage research collaborations  which licenses have since expired  and o fees from conducting incidental laboratory assay services 
we estimate that total operating expenses will continue to increase in fiscal and we do not expect to achieve profitable operating levels until the fourth quarter of fiscal year further  development of lr  bci and other product candidates  or expansion of hectorol into other therapeutic areas  will require significant  time consuming and costly research and development  pre clinical testing and extensive clinical trials prior to submission of any regulatory application for commercial use 
we plan to continue pre clinical testing of lr and bci and we currently plan to begin phase i clinical trials on lr in fiscal year we expect to incur losses into the year ended june  until revenues from the sale of hectorol products are sufficient to offset those expenses 
the amount and timing of our operating expenses will depend on many factors  including o the extent to which hectorol capsules and hectorol injection obtain expanded market acceptance  o the costs of sales and marketing activities associated with hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  o the status of our research and development activities  o the costs involved in preparing  filing  prosecuting  maintaining  protecting and enforcing our patent claims and other proprietary rights  o our ability to maintain our current manufacturing capabilities through relationships with third parties or establish those capabilities internally  o technological and other changes in the competitive landscape  and o evaluation of the commercial viability or potential of product candidates  which could significantly affect future expenditures for sales  marketing and product development 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our financial results are not necessarily meaningful 
critical accounting policies and estimates our significant accounting policies are described in note to the notes to the financial statements included elsewhere in this filing 
those financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to our provision for sales returns and allowances  allowance for doubtful accounts  and our estimate of excess and obsolete inventory 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis of judgments regarding the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
sales returns and allowances when revenue is recognized  bone care simultaneously records an estimate of various costs  which reduce product sales 
these costs include estimates for product returns  chargebacks  rebates  and discounts 
estimates are based on a variety of factors including historical return experience  rebate and chargeback agreements  inventory levels at our wholesale customers  and estimated sales by our wholesale customers to other third parties who have contracts with us  respectively 
actual experience associated with any of these items may differ materially from our estimates 
factors are reviewed that influence our estimates and  if necessary  adjustments are made when we believe that actual product returns  chargebacks  rebates  and discounts may differ from established reserves 
allowance for doubtful accounts an allowance is maintained for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
credit terms are extended on an uncollateralized basis primarily to wholesale drug distributors and independent clinics throughout the us management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debts  customer credit worthiness  percentage of accounts receivable by aging category  and changes in customer payment terms when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in impairment in their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
our actual losses from uncollectible accounts have been immaterial to date 
excess and obsolete inventory inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market  with cost determined on the first in  first out method 
in evaluating whether inventory is stated at the lower of cost or market  management considers such factors as the amount of inventory on hand  expiration dates  and the estimated time to sell such inventory 
as appropriate  provisions are made to reduce inventories to their net realizable value 
cost of inventories that potentially may not sell prior to expiration or are deemed of no commercial value have been written off when identified 
results of operations for fiscal years ended june  compared to june  product sales increased to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  this increase resulted from increased sales of hectorol injection offset by a decrease in sales of hectorol capsules 
hectorol injection  launched in august  generated sales of  during the year ended june  compared to  in the year ended june   reflecting increased market acceptance in spite of our inability to supply hectorol injection for approximately months between december and march hectorol capsule sales were  for the year ended june   compared to  for the year ended june  fiscal year hectorol capsule revenues benefited from a temporary supply shortage of the competitive drug rocaltrol between august and december gross margins on product sales were  or of product sales  for the year ended june  compared to  or of product sales  for the year ended june  the gross margin on hectorol injection sales was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the gross margin on hectorol capsule sales was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
overall gross margins were lower as a percentage of sales in fiscal year compared to fiscal year due to an increased cost of hectorol injection supplied by draxis pharma inc as compared to akorn  inc  increased spending for quality assurance  and costs associated with the validation activities for the hectorol injection manufacturing processes 
validation costs for hectorol injection were  for the year ended june  no validation costs were incurred in the year ended june our research and development expenses were  in the year ended june   compared to  in the year ended june  the  increase is attributable to consulting expenses related to validating computer network systems used in operating clinical software  and internal costs to file the supplemental new drug application snda for mcg hectorol capsules 
sales and marketing expenses increased  to  in the year ended june   from  in the year ended june  these increases are attributable to the addition of senior level positions within the sales and marketing departments and increased market research and promotional spending related to the peritoneal dialysis and chronic kidney disease markets 
general and administrative expenses increased  to  in the year ended june   from  in the year ended june  the increase was attributable to costs associated with the compensation package for the new president and ceo  increases in insurance premiums for property  casualty  and liability policies  and increases in legal fees 
interest income decreased  to  in the year ended june   from  in the year ended june  the decrease was due to lower average cash and marketable security balances for the year ended june   as well as a decline in yield on our investments 
results of operations for fiscal years ended june  compared to june  product sales increased to  for the year ended june   from  for the year ended june  this increase resulted from increased sales of both hectorol injection and hectorol capsules 
hectorol injection  launched in august  generated sales of  during the year ended june  compared to  in the year ended june  hectorol capsule sales were  for the year ended june   compared to  in the year ended june  gross margins on product sales were  or of product sales  for the year ended june  compared to  or of product sales  for the year ended june  the gross margin on hectorol injection sales was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the gross margin on hectorol capsule sales was and for the years ended june  and  respectively 
the increase in hectorol capsule gross margins was the result of selling inventory that was previously written off 
cost of sales includes a writedown of  of excess hectorol capsule inventory in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal  representing amounts we estimated would not be sold prior to the expiration date 
during the year ended june   bone care subsequently recovered approximately  of hectorol capsule inventory that was previously written off when the fda agreed to extend the expiration date from four to five years 
we also wrote off  of hectorol injection inventory in the year ended june  that did not meet quality control release test standards 
our research and development expenses were  in the year ended june  compared to  in the year ended june  the  increase is attributable to expanded preclinical studies designed to evaluate early stage compounds in the treatment of psoriasis and prostate  breast  and colon cancers  an increase of one preclinical and two clinical positions and related salaries and benefits  and increased facility costs at our new middleton  wisconsin  site 
sales and marketing expenses increased  to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  these increases are attributable to an increase in the sales force from to during the year ended june  we also increased the clinical support staff from to  and the marketing staff from to during the year ended june  we implemented these headcount increases in anticipation of a national j code that became effective january  this code was issued by the centers for medicare and medicaid services cms for reimbursement of hectorol injection during hemodialysis 
general and administrative expenses increased  to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  the increase was the result of our overall growth and related expansion of infrastructure to support bone care s increased commercial activities 
these increases include costs associated with the executive search for the president and ceo position  increased insurance premiums  salaries and general legal fees 
interest income decreased  to  in the year ended june  from  in the year ended june  the decrease was due to lower average cash and marketable security balances for the year ended june   as well as a decline in yield on our investments 
liquidity and capital resources net cash used in operating activities was  in fiscal year   in fiscal year and  in fiscal year the cash used by operating activities was used primarily to fund research and development as well as marketing and commercialization efforts for hectorol capsules and hectorol injection 
we have experienced negative cash flows from operations since our inception and do not anticipate generating sufficient positive cash flows to fund our operations until we achieve  if ever  sufficient revenues from the sale of hectorol capsules and hectorol injection 
we have expended  and expect to continue to expend in the future  substantial funds for our o research and development programs  o pre clinical and clinical testing  o regulatory processes  including completion of fda post approval phase iv commitments for hectorol capsules and hectorol injection  o manufacturing expenses  o sales and marketing programs  and o other operating expenses 
cash  cash equivalents and short and long term marketable securities were  at june  and  at june  cash and cash equivalents and investments are currently comprised primarily in money market funds  short term investment grade us government  municipal and corporate debt securities 
bone care s working capital requirements will depend on numerous factors  including the progress of commercialization and marketing activities  the progress of its research and development programs  the progress of preclinical and clinical testing  the time and cost involved in obtaining regulatory approvals  the cost of filing  prosecuting  defending and enforcing any patent claims and other intellectual property rights  competing technological and market developments  changes and developments in bone care s existing licensing relationships and the terms of any new collaborative  licensing  co promotion or distribution arrangements that bone care may establish  the cost of manufacturing preclinical and clinical products  and other factors not within our control 
based upon our current plans  we believe that we will have sufficient funds to meet our operating expenses and capital requirements for at least the next year 
if necessary  additional capital to fund our operations may be sought through equity or debt offerings or other financings 
there is no assurance that such additional funds will be available on acceptable terms  if at all 
at june   we had state tax net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and state research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which will begin expiring in and  respectively 
we also had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and research and development tax credit carryforwards of approximately  which will begin expiring in and  respectively

recent accounting pronouncements in november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin no 
requires that a guarantor must recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation that it has undertaken in issuing a guarantee 
fin no 
also addresses the disclosure requirements that a guarantor must include in its financial statements for guarantees issued 
the disclosure requirements in this interpretation are effective for financial statements ending after december  the initial recognition and measurement provisions of this interpretation are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  bone care has not issued guarantees of indebtedness as of june  in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standard sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements of the effects of stock based compensation 
the interim disclosure requirements of sfas no 
are effective for interim periods beginning after december  bone care s stock based compensation related to employees and non employee directors is recognized using the intrinsic value method in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and thus there is no compensation expense for options granted with exercise prices equal to the fair value of bone care s common stock on the date of the grant 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our sales from inception to date have been made solely to us customers  and as a result  we have not had any exposure to factors such as changes in foreign currency exchange rates or weak economic conditions in foreign markets 
however  in future periods  we expect to sell in foreign markets  including europe and asia 
as our sales are made in us dollars  a strengthening of the us dollar could make our products less competitive in foreign markets 
as of june   we held  of short term marketable securities and  of long term marketable securities 
the investments have been made for investment as opposed to trading purposes 
interest rate risk with respect to our investments is not significant as all such investments are in us dollar cash equivalents and are o short term investments  which are by their nature less sensitive to interest rate movements  or o have maturities in excess of one year and are expected to be held to maturity  thereby eliminating the risks associated with interest rate changes
