item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations financial condition and liquidity summary 
our financial condition and liquidity depends on the cash flow from our two principal subsidiaries and borrowings under our bank loan agreement 
our cash flow is influenced mainly by the prices we receive for our natural gas production  the demand for and the dayrates we receive for our drilling rigs and  to a lesser extent  the prices we receive for our oil production 
at december   we had cash totaling  and we had borrowed million of the million we have elected to have available under our loan agreement

our bank loan agreement 
on july   we signed a million bank loan agreement 
at our election  the amount currently available for us to borrow is million 
although the current value of our assets would have allowed us to have access to the full million  we elected to set the loan commitment at million to reduce our financing costs since we are charged a facility fee of 
of percent on the amount available but not borrowed 
at december   we had borrowed million through the bank loan 
each year  on april and october  our banks re determine the loan value of our assets 
this value is mainly based on an amount equal to a percentage of the discounted future value of our oil and natural gas reserves  as determined by the banks 
in addition  an amount representing a part of the value of our drilling rig fleet  limited to million  is added to the loan value 
our loan agreement provides for a revolving credit facility which ends on may  followed by a three year term loan 
borrowing under our loan agreement totaled million on february  borrowings under the revolving credit facility bear interest at the chase manhattan bank  na prime rate prime rate or the london interbank offered rates libor rate plus to percent depending on the level of debt as a percentage of the total loan value 
after may   borrowings under the loan agreement bear interest at the prime rate or the libor rate plus to percent depending on the level of debt as a percentage of the total loan value 
in addition  the loan agreement allows us to select between the date of the agreement and days before the start of the term loan  a fixed rate for the amount outstanding under the credit facility 
our ability to select the fixed rate option is subject to several conditions  all of which are set out in the loan agreement 
the interest rate on our bank debt was percent at december  and february  at our election  any portion of our outstanding bank debt may be fixed at the libor rate  as adjusted depending on the level of our debt as a percentage of the amount available for us to borrow 
the libor rate may be fixed for periods of up to   or days with the balance of our bank debt being subject to the prime rate 
during any libor rate funding period  we may not pay any part of the outstanding principal balance which is subject to the libor rate 
borrowings subject to the libor rate were million at december  and million at february  the loan agreement also requires us to maintain 
consolidated net worth of at least million  
a current ratio of not less than to  
a ratio of long term debt  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to  
a ratio of total liabilities  as defined in the loan agreement  to consolidated tangible net worth not greater than to  and 
working capital provided by operations  as defined in the loan agreement  cannot be less than million in any year 
we are restricted from paying dividends other than stock dividends during any fiscal year in excess of percent of our consolidated net income from the preceding fiscal year 
additionally  we can pay dividends if our working capital provided from our operations during the preceding year is equal to or greater than percent of current maturities of long term debt at the end of the preceding year 
we also cannot incur additional debt except in certain limited exceptions 
the creation or existence of mortgages or liens  other than those in the ordinary course of business  on any of our property is prohibited unless it is in favor of our banks 
hedging 
periodically we hedge the prices we will receive for a portion of our future natural gas and oil production 
we do so in an attempt to reduce the impact and uncertainty that price variations have on our cash flow 
we entered into a collar contract covering approximately percent of our daily oil production from november  through february  the collar had a floor of per barrel and a ceiling of per barrel and we received per barrel for entering into the transaction 
during the first quarter of  our oil hedging transaction yielded an increase in our oil revenues of during the second quarter of  we entered into a natural gas collar contract for approximately percent of our june and july production  at a floor price of and a ceiling price of 
during the third quarter of  we entered into two natural gas collar contracts for approximately percent of our september thru november natural gas production 
both contracts had a floor price of 
one contract had a ceiling of and the other contract had a ceiling of 
during the year of  the collar contracts increased natural gas revenues by  on april   we entered into a collar contract covering approximately percent of our natural gas production for the periods of april  thru october  the collar had a floor of and a ceiling of 
during the year of  our natural gas hedging transactions increased natural gas revenues by  we did not have any hedging transactions outstanding at december  during the first quarter of  we entered into two collar contracts covering approximately percent of our natural gas production for the periods of april  thru september  one collar has a floor of and a ceiling of and the other collar has a floor of and a ceiling of 
we also entered into two collar contracts covering approximately percent of our oil production for the periods of may  thru december  one collar has a floor of and a ceiling of and the other collar has a floor of and a ceiling of 
self insurance 
we are self insured for certain losses relating to workers compensation  general liability  property damage and employee medical benefits 
with the recent tightening in the insurance markets our self insurance levels have significantly increased 
during the august  renewal of most of our insurance policies  our exposure ie our deductible or retention per occurrence we elected to incur ranged from  for general liability to million for rig physical damage 
we have purchased stop loss coverage in order to limit  to the extent feasible  our per occurrence and aggregate exposure to certain claims 
there is no assurance that such coverage will adequately protect us against liability from all potential consequences 
impact of prices for our oil and natural gas 
natural gas comprises percent of our total oil and natural gas reserves 
any significant change in natural gas prices has a material affect on our revenues  cash flow and the value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
generally  prices and demand for domestic natural gas are influenced by weather conditions  supply imbalances and by world wide oil price levels 
domestic oil prices are primarily influenced by world oil market developments 
all of these factors are beyond our control and we can not predict nor measure their future influence on the prices we will receive 
based on our production in  a 
per mcf change in what we are paid for our natural gas production would result in a corresponding  per month  annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow 
our average natural gas price was compared to an average natural gas price of received a per barrel change in our oil price would have a  per month  annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow 
our average oil price was compared with an average oil price of received in because natural gas prices have such a significant affect on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves  declines in these prices can result in a decline in the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties 
price declines can also adversely affect the semi annual determination of the amount available for us to borrow under our bank loan agreement since that determination is based mainly on the value of our oil and natural gas reserves 
such a reduction could limit our ability to carry out our planned capital projects 
we sell most of our natural gas production to third parties under month to month contracts 
several of these buyers have experienced financial complications resulting from the recent investigations into the energy trading industry 
the long term implications to the energy trading business  as well as to oil and natural gas producers  because of these investigations remains  to be determined 
presently we believe that our buyers will be able to perform their commitments to us 
however  we continue to evaluate the information available to us about these buyers in an effort to reduce any possible future adverse impact to us 
oil and natural gas acquisitions and capital expenditures 
most of our capital expenditures are discretionary and directed toward future growth 
our decision to increase our oil and natural gas reserves through acquisitions or through drilling depends on the prevailing or expected market conditions  potential return on investment  future drilling potential and opportunities to obtain financing under the circumstances involved  all of which provide us with a large degree of flexibility in deciding when to incur such costs 
we drilled wells net wells in compared to wells net wells in in december  we acquired producing oil and natural gas wells for million 
our total capital expenditures for oil and natural gas exploration and acquisitions in totaled million 
based on current prices  we plan to drill an estimated to wells in and total capital expenditures for oil and natural gas exploration and acquisitions is planned to be around million 
contract drilling 
our drilling work is subject to many factors that influence the number of rigs we have working as well as the costs and revenues associated with such work 
these factors include competition from other drilling contractors  the prevailing prices for natural gas and oil  availability and cost of labor to run our rigs and our ability to supply the equipment needed 
we have not encountered major difficulty in hiring and keeping rig crews  but such shortages have occurred periodically in the past 
if demand for drilling rigs increases rapidly in the future  shortages of experienced personnel may limit our ability to increase the number of rigs we could operate 
most of our contract drilling fleet is targeted to the drilling of natural gas wells  so changes in natural gas prices influence the demand for our drilling rigs and the prices we can charge for our contract drilling services 
low oil and natural gas prices  during most of the s and s  reduced demand for domestic land contract drilling rigs 
in the last half of and throughout  as oil and natural gas prices increased  we experienced a big increase in demand for our rigs 
demand continued to increase until the end of the third quarter of and reached a high when of our rigs were working in july because of declining natural gas prices throughout  demand for our rigs dropped significantly in the fourth quarter of and stabilized with between and rigs operating in the first half on natural gas and oil prices once again began to rise during the last half of with the august acquisition of rigs described below  the average use of our rigs in was rigs percent compared with rigs percent for as demand for our rigs increased during so did the dayrates we received 
our average dayrate reached  by september of however  as demand began to decrease  so did our rates 
our average dayrate in was  compared to  for based on the average utilization of our rigs in  a per day change in dayrates has a  per day  annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow 
utilization and dayrates for our drilling rigs will depend mainly on the price of natural gas 
our contract drilling subsidiary provides drilling services for our exploration and production subsidiary 
the contracts for these services are issued under the same conditions and rates as the contracts we have entered into with unrelated third parties 
per regulations provided by the securities and exchange commission  the profit received by our contract drilling segment of  and  during and  respectively  was used to reduce the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties rather than being included in our profits in current operations 
drilling acquisitions and capital expenditures 
on august   we completed the acquisition of crec rig equipment company and cdc drilling company  which included twenty drilling rigs  spare drilling equipment and vehicles  for million shares of our common stock and million in cash 
total consideration for the acquisition was valued at million of which million went to goodwill and million went to deferred tax assets 
all of the rigs are operational and range in horsepower from to  with having a horsepower rating of  or more 
depth capacities range from  to  feet and twelve of the rigs are scr electric 
these agreements also give us the exclusive first option to purchase any additional rigs constructed by one of the sellers within the next three years 
the addition of these twenty rigs brought our fleet to for our contract drilling operations during  we incurred million in capital expenditures  which included million for goodwill and million for deferred tax assets 
for the year  we anticipate capital expenditures of approximately million for our contract drilling operations 
oil and natural gas limited partnerships and other entity relationships 
as of december   we rolled up nine of our employee partnerships into a consolidated partnership 
after the rollup  we are the general partner for ten oil and natural gas partnerships which were formed privately and publicly 
the partnership s revenues and costs are shared under formulas prescribed in each limited partnership agreement 
the partnerships repay us for contract drilling  well supervision and general and administrative expense 
related party transactions for contract drilling and well supervision fees are the related party s share of such costs 
these costs are billed on the same basis as billings to unrelated third parties for similar services 
general and administrative reimbursements consist of direct general and administrative expense incurred on the related party s behalf as well as indirect expenses assigned to the related parties 
allocations are based on the related party s level of activity and are considered by management to be reasonable 
during  and  the total paid to us for all of these fees was   and  respectively 
we expect the fees to be about the same in our proportionate share of assets  liabilities and net income relating to the oil and natural gas partnerships is included in our consolidated financial statements 
we own a percent equity interest in a natural gas gathering and processing company 
our investment  including our share of the equity in the earnings of this company  totaled million at december  and is reported in other assets in our accompanying balance sheet 
from time to time we may guarantee the debt of this company 
however  as of december  and february   we were not guaranteeing any of the debt of this company 
outlook 
both of our operating segments are extremely dependent on natural gas prices 
these prices affect not only our production revenues  but also the future demand and rates for our contract drilling services 
on february   the nymex henry hub average contract settle price for the next twelve months was 
we anticipate that if natural gas prices continue at that level  there will be an increase in demand for our rigs and an upward movement on the rates we receive for our contract drilling services 
there is a certain degree of uncertainty as to whether these prices can be sustained 
this uncertainty has  in turn  made it difficult to measure the future use of our drilling rigs 
we would anticipate that if current natural gas prices are  in fact  maintained we will experience an upward movement in demand for our rigs 
contractual commitments 
we have the following contractual obligations at december  payments due by period less contractual than after obligations total year years years years in thousands bank debt     hickman note   retirement agreement  operating leases  total contractual obligations      see previous discussion in management discussion and analysis regarding bank debt 
on november   we acquired hickman drilling company pursuant to an agreement and plan of merger entered into by and between us  hickman drilling company and all of the holders of the outstanding capital stock of hickman drilling company 
as part of this acquisition  the former shareholders of hickman held  as of december   promissory notes in the aggregate outstanding principal amount of million see note of our consolidated financial statements 
these notes were paid in full in january the notes bore interest at the chase prime rate  which at december  was percent 
in the second quarter of  we recorded million in additional employee benefit expenses for the present value of a separation agreement made in connection with the retirement of king kirchner from his position as chief executive officer 
the liability associated with this expense  including accrued interest  will be paid in monthly payments of  starting in july and continuing through june see note of our consolidated financial statements 
we lease office space in tulsa  houston and woodward under the terms of operating leases expiring through january  see note of our consolidated financial statements 
at december   we also have the following commitments and contingencies that could create  increase or accelerate our liabilities amount of commitment expiration per period total amount committed less other or than after commitments accrued year years years years in thousands deferred compensation agreement  unknown unknown unknown unknown separation benefit agreement  unknown unknown unknown gas balancing liability  unknown unknown unknown unknown repurchase obliga tions unknown unknown unknown unknown unknown we provide a salary deferral plan which allows participants to defer the recognition of salary for income tax purposes until actual distribution of benefits  which occurs at either termination of employment  death or certain defined unforeseeable emergency hardships 
we recognize payroll expense and record a liability  included in other long term liabilities in our consolidated balance sheet  at the time of deferral see note of our consolidated financial statements 
effective january   we adopted a separation benefit plan separation plan 
the separation plan allows eligible employees whose employment with us is involuntarily terminated or  in the case of an employee who has completed years of service  voluntarily or involuntarily terminated  to receive benefits equivalent to weeks salary for every whole year of service completed with unit up to a maximum of weeks 
to receive payments the recipient must waive any claims against us in exchange for receiving the separation benefits 
on october   we adopted a separation benefit plan for senior management senior plan 
the senior plan provides certain officers and key executives of unit with benefits generally equivalent to the separation plan 
the compensation committee of the board of directors has absolute discretion in the selection of the individuals covered in this plan see note of our consolidated financial statements 
in december  we recorded a liability on certain properties where we believe there is insufficient reserves available to allow the under produced owners to recover their under production from future production volumes 
we formed the unit oil and gas limited partnership and the energy income limited partnership along with private limited partnerships the partnerships with certain qualified employees  officers and directors from through  with a subsidiary of ours serving as general partner 
the partnerships were formed for the purpose of conducting oil and natural gas acquisition  drilling and development operations and serving as co general partner with us in any additional limited partnerships formed during that year 
the partnerships participated on a proportionate basis with us in most drilling operations and most producing property acquisitions commenced by us for our own account during the period from the formation of the partnership through december of each year 
these partnership agreements require  upon the election of a limited partner  that we repurchase the limited partner s interest at amounts to be determined by appraisal in the future 
such repurchases in any one year are limited to percent of the units outstanding 
we made repurchases of  and  in and  respectively  for such limited partners interests 
no repurchases were made in see note of our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies 
we account for our oil and natural gas exploration and development activities using the full cost method of accounting 
under this method  all costs incurred in the acquisition  exploration and development of oil and natural gas properties are capitalized 
at the end of each quarter  the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties is limited to the lower of unamortized cost or a ceiling 
the ceiling is defined as the sum of the present value percent discount rate of estimated future net revenues from proved reserves  based on period end oil and natural gas prices  plus the lower of cost or estimated fair value of unproved properties not included in the costs being amortized  less related income taxes 
if the net capitalized costs of our oil and natural gas properties exceed the ceiling  we are subject to a write down to the extent of such excess 
a ceiling test write down is a non cash charge to earnings 
if required  it reduces earnings and impacts stockholders equity in the period of occurrence and results in lower depreciation  depletion and amortization expense in future periods 
once incurred  a write down cannot be reversed even if prices subsequently recover 
the risk that we will be required to write down the carrying value of our oil and natural gas properties increases when oil and natural gas prices are depressed or if we have large downward revisions in our estimated proved reserves 
application of these rules during periods of relatively low oil or natural gas prices  even if temporary  increases the chance of a ceiling test write down 
based on oil and natural gas prices on december  per mcf for natural gas and per barrel for oil  the unamortized cost of our domestic oil and natural gas properties did not exceed the ceiling of our proved oil and natural gas reserves 
natural gas prices remain erratic and any significant declines below quarter end prices used in the reserve evaluation could result in a ceiling test write down in following quarterly reporting periods 
the value of our oil and natural gas reserves is used to determine the loan value under our bank loan agreement 
this value is affected by both price changes and the measurement of reserve volumes 
oil and natural gas reserves cannot be measured exactly 
our estimate of oil and natural gas reserves require extensive judgments of our reservoir engineering data and are less precise than other estimates made in connection with financial disclosures 
assigning monetary values to such estimates does not reduce the subjectivity and changing nature of such reserve estimates 
indeed the uncertainties inherent in the disclosure are compounded by applying additional estimates of the rates and timing of production and the costs that will be incurred in developing and producing the reserves 
we use the sales method for recording natural gas sales 
this method allows for recognition of revenue  which may be more or less than our share of pro rata production from certain wells 
our policy is to expense our pro rata share of lease operating costs from all wells as incurred 
such expenses relating to the natural gas balancing position on wells in which we have an imbalance are not material 
drilling equipment  transportation equipment and other property and equipment are carried at cost 
renewals and betterments are capitalized while repairs and maintenance are expensed 
realization of the carrying value of property and equipment is reviewed for possible impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances suggest the carrying amount may not be recoverable 
assets are determined to be impaired if a forecast of undiscounted estimated future net operating cash flows directly related to the asset including disposal value if any  is less than the carrying amount of the asset 
if any asset is determined to be impaired  the loss is measured as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds its fair value 
an estimate of fair value is based on the best information available  including prices for similar assets 
changes in such estimates could cause us to reduce the carrying value of property and equipment 
we recognize revenues generated for daywork drilling contracts as the services are performed  which is similar to the percentage of completion method 
under footage and turnkey contracts  we bear the risk of completion of the well  so revenues and expenses are recognized using the completed contract method 
the entire amount of a loss  if any  is recorded when the loss can be reasonably determined  however  any profit is recorded only at the time the well is finished 
the costs of uncompleted drilling contracts include expenses incurred to date on footage or turnkey contracts  which are still in process at the end of the period  and are included in other current assets 
effects of inflation in the years prior to the last half of  the effects of inflation on our operations was minimal due to low inflation rates and moderate demand for contract drilling services 
however  starting in the last half of and throughout and the first three quarters of  as drilling rig dayrates and utilization increased  the impact of inflation increased as the availability of used equipment and third party services decreased 
due to industry wide demand for qualified labor  contract drilling labor costs increased substantially in the summer of and once again in the summer of and when rig dayrates declined in the labor rates did not come back down to the levels incurred prior to the increases 
how inflation will affect us in the future will depend on additional increases  if any  realized in our drilling rig rates and the prices we receive for our oil and natural gas 
if industry activity recovers and returns to levels achieved in early  shortages in support equipment such as drill pipe  third party services and qualified labor could occur resulting in additional corresponding increases in our material and labor costs 
these conditions may limit our ability to realize improvements in operating profits 
new accounting pronouncements in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations fas 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after june  january  for us and establishes an accounting standard requiring the recording of the fair value of liabilities associated with the retirement of long lived assets mainly plugging and abandonment costs for our depleted wells in the period in which the liability is incurred at the time the wells are drilled 
in the first quarter of  the effect of the implementation of fas unaudited is expected to increase liabilities including deferred taxes by million  increase the net book value of our oil and natural gas properties by million and we anticipate adjustment to increase net income for the accumulated effect of a change in accounting principle of million 
in april  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement  and technical corrections fas 
fas is effective for fiscal years beginning after may  this statement eliminates an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
this statement also amends other existing authoritative pronouncements to make various technical corrections  clarify meanings  or describe their applicability under changed conditions 
we do not expect the adoption of fas to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cashflows 
in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for cost associated with exit or disposal activities fas 
fas is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and requires companies to recognize costs associated with exit or disposal activities when they are incurred rather than at the date of a commitment to an exit or disposal plan 
fas nullifies emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
we do not expect the adoption of fas to have a material effect on our financial position  results of operations or cashflow 
on december   the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fas fas 
fas provides additional transition guidance for companies that elect to voluntarily adopt the accounting provisions of fas  accounting for stock based compensation 
fas does not change the provisions of fas that permit entities to continue to apply the intrinsic value method of apb  accounting for stock issued to employees apb 
since we apply apb  our accounting for stock based compensation will not change as a result of fas fas does require certain new disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
the required annual disclosures were effective immediately for us and have been included in note of our financial statements 
the new interim disclosure provisions will be effective for us in the first quarter of on november   the fasb issued fasb interpretation no

fin 
fin clarifies the requirements of fasb statement no 
 accounting for contingencies fas  relating to the guarantor s accounting for  and disclosure of  the issuance of certain types of guarantees 
for guarantees that fall within the scope of fin  the interpretation requires that guarantors recognize a liability equal to the fair value of the guarantee upon its issuance 
the interpretation s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees that were issued before the date of fin s initial application may not be revised or restated to reflect the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that end after december  we have guaranteed liabilities in the past which would fall under the terms of fin  but we do not have any such guarantees at december  on january   the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb fin 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on the identification of entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities or vies and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity which either the equity investors if any do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
we do not expect the adoption of this standard to have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations

our total interest expense is lower due to lower interest rates along with a reduction in our long term debt 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our operations are exposed to market risks primarily as a result of changes in commodity prices and interest rates 
commodity price risk 
our major market risk exposure is in the price we receive for our oil and natural gas production 
the price we receive is primarily driven by the prevailing worldwide price for crude oil and market prices applicable to our natural gas production 
historically  prices we received for our oil and natural gas production fluctuated and such fluctuation is expected to continue 
the price of natural gas also effects the demand for our rigs and the amount we can charge for the use of the rigs 
based on our production  a 
per mcf change in what we are paid for our natural gas production would result in a corresponding  per month  annualized change in our pre tax cash flow 
a per barrel change in our oil price would have a  per month  annualized change in our pre tax operating cash flow 
in an effort to try and reduce the impact of price fluctuations  over the past several years we periodically have used hedging strategies to hedge the price we will receive for a portion of our future oil and natural gas production 
a detailed explanation of those transactions has been included under hedging in the financial condition portion of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations included above 
interest rate risk 
our interest rate exposure relates to our long term debt  all of which bears interest at variable rates based on the prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor rate 
at our election  borrowings under our revolving credit and term loan may be fixed at the libor rate for periods up to days 
historically  we have not utilized any financial instruments  such as interest rate swaps  to manage our exposure to increases in interest rates 
however  we may use such financial instruments in the future should our assessment of future interest rates warrant such use 
based on our average outstanding long term debt in  a one percent change in the floating rate would change our annual pre tax cash flow by approximately
