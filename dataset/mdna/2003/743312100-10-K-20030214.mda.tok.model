item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company develops  markets and supports application development  deployment  integration and management software 
its core product line  progress  is composed primarily of the progress provision  progress rdbms  progress webspeed  progress appserver and progress dataserver products 
in may  the company began shipping the latest release of its progress product line  progress version d

the company also resells  in connection with its own software  third party products for reporting and business intelligence solutions 
geographic expansion in overseas markets has been achieved through a combination of establishing offices in new markets and the acquisition of progress related assets of certain distributors 
over the past several years  the company s revenue and net income have been adversely affected by the strengthening of the us dollar against many of the major currencies from which a substantial portion of its international revenue is derived 
however  in the second half of fiscal  the dollar weakened against such currencies and the company s revenue and net income were positively affected by changes in exchange rates 
if the dollar continues to weaken against such currencies in fiscal  the company s revenue and net income will be positively affected by such exchange rate changes 
the company conducts business through three principal operating units and a supporting research and business development unit 
the first operating unit conducts business as the progress company and provides the openedge business platform  a set of development and deployment technologies  which includes the progress rdbms 
the second operating unit  sonic software  is a provider of standards based integration products and services 
the third unit  peerdirect  provides replication technology for distributed computing 
psc labs is the unit that has responsibility for research and new business development activities

critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company makes estimates and assumptions in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  revenue and expenses  and related disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
the company bases its estimates on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
however  actual results may differ from these estimates 
the company has identified the following critical accounting policies that require the use of significant judgments and estimates in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements 
this listing is not a comprehensive list of all of the company s accounting policies 
for further information regarding the application of these and other accounting policies  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition the company s revenue recognition policy is significant because revenue is a key component affecting results of operations 
in determining when to recognize revenue from a customer arrangement  the company is often required to exercise judgment regarding the application of its accounting policies to a particular arrangement 
for example  judgment is required in determining whether a customer arrangement has multiple elements 
if such a situation exists  judgment is also involved in determining whether vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value for the undelivered elements exists 
while the company follows specific and detailed rules and guidelines related to revenue recognition  significant management judgments and estimates are made and used in connection with the revenue recognized in any reporting period  particularly in the areas 
table of contents described above as well as collectibility 
if management made different estimates or judgments  material differences in the timing of the recognition of revenue could occur 
allowance for doubtful accounts the company maintains an allowance for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of customers to make required payments 
this allowance is established using estimates that the company makes based on factors such as the composition of the accounts receivable aging  historical bad debts  changes in payment patterns  customer creditworthiness and current economic trends 
if the company used different estimates  or if the financial condition of customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional provisions for doubtful accounts would be required and would increase bad debt expense 
deferred income taxes the company had a net deferred tax asset of million at november  the company records valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
the company considers scheduled reversals of deferred tax liabilities  projected future taxable income  ongoing tax planning strategies and other matters in assessing the need for and the amount of a valuation allowance 
if the company were to change its assumptions or otherwise determine that it was unable to realize all or part of its net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period that such change or determination was made 
investment in related party the company holds a minority interest in easyask  inc  a privately held software company whose chairman is a member of the board of directors of the company 
during fiscal  the company recorded an impairment charge of million related to this investment based upon a financing valuation 
the investment was valued at million at november  the company periodically considers available evidence in evaluating potential impairment of its investment in easyask 
because no public market exists for this investment  the company estimates its value based on past and potential financing valuations  the anticipated future performance of the company  as well as the external markets for these types of investments 
if these estimates prove to be inaccurate  or in the event of future adverse changes in market conditions or poor operating results of the underlying company  an inability to recover the remaining carrying value of the investment could result  thereby possibly requiring an additional impairment charge 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain income and expense items as a percentage of total revenue  and the percentage change in dollar amounts of such items compared with the corresponding period in the previous fiscal year 
percentage of total revenue period to period change year ended november  compared to compared to revenue software licenses maintenance and services total revenue costs and expenses cost of software licenses cost of maintenance and services sales and marketing product development general and administrative total costs and expenses income from operations other income expense  net income before provision for income taxes provision for income taxes net income 
table of contents fiscal compared to fiscal the company s total revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal total revenue would have been increased by in fiscal if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal as compared to the exchange rates in effect in fiscal total revenue derived from the sonic product line was million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal the sonic product line revenue in fiscal included the recognition of million of deferred license revenue related to the expiration of one contract signed in a previous year 
revenue from the nusphere and peerdirect product lines in each period was not significant 
software license revenue decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in software license revenue in fiscal was primarily due to a decline in demand from end user customers  partially offset by an increase in revenue through independent software vendors isvs  companies which have written software applications utilizing progress software technology and which resell the company s products in conjunction with the sale of their applications 
software license revenue from development products  such as progress provision  and from most deployment products  including the progress rdbms  decreased year over year 
partially offsetting the decline in license revenue from these product groups was a significant increase in license revenue from the sonic product line  which represented slightly over of total software license revenue 
maintenance and services revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in maintenance and services revenue was primarily the result of growth in the company s installed customer base and renewal of maintenance contracts  partially offset by a decline in services revenue 
the decline in services revenue was primarily the result of decreases in consulting revenue in north america and the asia pacific region due to delays in new engagements  fewer projects as a result of economic conditions and a slower overall market for professional services 
education revenue also decreased in fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue generated in markets outside north america increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and represented of total revenue in each of fiscal and fiscal the increase was the result of higher revenue from emea and asia pacific  partially offset by a continued decline in revenue in latin america in fiscal the decrease in this region was due to an overall market slowdown in the purchase of packaged applications  especially in the government sector in various countries within latin america 
total revenue generated in markets outside north america as a percentage of total revenue in fiscal would have decreased by less than one absolute percentage point as compared to the reported ratio if exchange rates had been constant in fiscal as compared to the exchange rates in effect in fiscal the company is planning for total revenue growth in fiscal in the range of to from existing businesses and expects total reported revenue to show growth of around with the addition of excelon 
this revenue expectation is based on a number of assumptions  including the continued success of the company s isvs  improvement in the company s ability to generate new business in end user accounts  the company s ability to successfully integrate the products and personnel from excelon  continued high growth from the company s new product sets  especially the sonic product line  and no strengthening of the us dollar against currencies from which the company derives a significant portion of its business 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be successful in achieving its forecasts and plans or that other factors will not negatively impact its revenue 
cost of software licenses consists primarily of cost of product media  documentation  duplication  packaging  royalties and amortization of capitalized software costs 
cost of software licenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of software license revenue from to 
the dollar and percentage increases were primarily due to higher royalty expense for products and technologies licensed from third parties  partially offset by lower amortization expense from previously capitalized software costs 
cost of software licenses as a percentage of software license revenue may vary from period to period depending upon the relative product mix 
the company expects costs of software licenses to range from to of the related software license revenue in a given period 
cost of maintenance and services consists primarily of costs of providing customer technical support  education and consulting 
cost of maintenance and services was essentially the same at million in fiscal as compared 
table of contents to million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of maintenance and services revenue from to 
the maintenance and services revenue margin improvement was due to such revenue in fiscal including a greater proportion of maintenance revenue  which has a substantially higher margin than professional services revenue 
significant changes affecting maintenance and service expenses in fiscal were greater usage of third party contractors for service engagements and a write down related to excess fixed assets  partially offset by lower headcount related expenses in the professional services group 
the company decreased its technical support  education  and consulting staff by from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal sales and marketing expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and represented the same percentage of total revenue in each period at

the company decreased its sales  sales support and marketing staff by from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal product development expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but decreased as a percentage of total revenue from to 
the dollar increase was primarily due to the absence of capitalized software costs in fiscal as compared to fiscal as a result of the timing and stage of development of projects that would qualify for capitalization under the company s software capitalization policy 
the major product development efforts in fiscal primarily related to the development and enhancement of new products such as sonicxq  sonicmq  dynamics  fathom  the peerdirect replication engine and the next release of progress  the company s principal product line 
headcount related expense savings in fiscal were offset by higher average compensation 
the company decreased its product development staff by from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal the company capitalized million of software development costs in fiscal and none in fiscal in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
the amount capitalized in fiscal represented of total product development costs that year 
capitalized software costs are amortized over the estimated life of the product generally four years in an amount equal to the greater of the amount computed using the ratio of current revenue to total expected revenue in the product s life or straight line 
amounts amortized are included in cost of software licenses 
general and administrative expenses include the costs of the finance  human resources  legal  information systems and administrative departments of the company 
general and administrative expenses increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal  but remained the same percentage of total revenue at 
excluding amortization of goodwill of million in fiscal  general and administrative expenses would have increased by in fiscal  primarily due to greater usage of outside contractors and professional services 
the company decreased its administrative staff by from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal income from operations increased as a percentage of total revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal the dollar increase and the increase in operating income as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to higher revenue during the year  partially offset by continued investment in new business opportunities such as sonic software and peerdirect 
in addition  the company s total headcount decreased throughout fiscal  primarily due to attrition 
however  operating expenses did not decrease proportionately due to increases in non headcount related items and higher average compensation 
with the acquisition of excelon  the company expects its headcount to be higher in fiscal as compared to fiscal if the company is able to meet its forecasted revenue target and expenses occur as planned  the company expects operating income as a percentage of revenue to be between and in fiscal  excluding the impact of any one time  acquisition related charges 
other income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to lower interest income and a second quarter noncash impairment charge of million related to the company s investment in a related party  easyask  inc the company wrote down the carrying amount of its investment to the estimated fair value based on a financing valuation obtained from the investee 
the decrease in interest income was due to lower interest rates 
the company expects its average interest earned on invested cash balances to be lower in fiscal as compared to fiscal due to the continued reduction in market interest rates 

table of contents the company s effective tax rate was in fiscal as compared to in fiscal see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

software license revenue decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease in software license revenue in fiscal was primarily due to a decline in demand from end user customers as well as isvs 
the software license decrease was partially offset by sales from new products such as sonicmq 
in addition  the company s license revenue was adversely affected by the strong us dollar  especially relative to the euro  the british pound and the brazilian real 
software license revenue from development products  such as progress provision  and most deployment products  including progress rdbms  decreased year over year 
partially offsetting the decline in license revenue from these product groups was a significant increase in license revenue from sonicmq 
however  this product line represented a small percentage of total software license revenue 
maintenance and services revenue increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the increase in maintenance and services revenue was primarily the result of growth in the company s installed customer base  renewal of maintenance contracts and growth in international consulting revenue  especially in emea 
the maintenance and services revenue increase was partially offset by a decline in consulting revenue in north america and global education revenue 
the decline in north america consulting revenue was primarily due to delays in new engagements  fewer projects as a result of economic conditions and a slower overall market  especially in the erp sector  for professional services in fiscal as compared to fiscal total revenue generated in markets outside north america decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and represented of total revenue in fiscal as compared to in fiscal the decrease was the result of substantially lower revenue in the asia pacific and latin america regions in fiscal as compared to fiscal the decrease in these regions was due to an overall market slowdown in the purchase of packaged applications  especially in the government sector in various countries within latin america

the dollar increase was primarily due to higher royalty expense for products and technologies licensed from third parties  partially offset by lower amortization expense from previously capitalized software costs

cost of maintenance and services increased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal and increased as a percentage of maintenance and services revenue from to

the company increased its administrative staff by from the end of fiscal to the end of fiscal income from operations decreased as a percentage of total revenue from in fiscal to in fiscal the dollar decrease and the decrease in operating income as a percentage of revenue was primarily due to lower than expected revenue during the year and continued investment in new business opportunities such as sonic software and nusphere 
this decrease was mitigated to some extent by the company s efforts to manage costs and expenses as expected revenue was not achieved 
other income decreased from million in fiscal to million in fiscal the decrease was primarily due to foreign currency losses in fiscal as compared to foreign currency gains in fiscal and lower interest income

the provisions of sfas are effective prospectively for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  factors that may affect future results the company operates in a rapidly changing environment that involves certain risks and uncertainties  some of which are beyond the company s control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks 
fluctuations in revenue and quarterly results the company may experience significant fluctuations in future quarterly operating results that may be caused by many factors 
some of these factors include changes in demand for the company s products  introduction  enhancement or announcement of products by the company and its competitors  market acceptance of new products  the growth rates of certain market segments including messaging  size and timing of significant orders  budgeting cycles of customers  mix of distribution channels  mix of products and services sold  mix of international and north american revenues  fluctuations in currency exchange rates  changes in the level of operating expenses  changes in the company s sales incentive plans  customer order deferrals in anticipation of new products announced by the company or its competitors and general economic conditions 
revenue forecasting is uncertain  in large part  because the company generally ships its products shortly after receipt of orders 
most of the company s expenses are relatively fixed  including costs of personnel and facilities  and are not easily reduced 
thus  an unexpected reduction in the company s revenue  or failure to achieve the anticipated rate of growth  would have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the company 

table of contents global economic and political conditions the global economic and political environment and the current business climate is likely to impact the company s revenue and net income in the near term 
various economic indicators and analysts do not predict an increase in demand for capital spending  especially within the technology sector  within the near future 
the aftermath of the terrorist attacks upon the united states and the potential for war with iraq as well as other potential geopolitical issues in north korea  venezuela and elsewhere also contribute to economic and political uncertainty 
if customers buying patterns  such as decision making processes  timing of expected deliveries and timing of new projects  unfavorably change due to economic or political conditions  there will be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
products ongoing enhancements to the company s products  including the progress product set and sonic product set  will be required to enable the company to maintain its competitive position 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing and marketing enhancements to its products on a timely basis  or that the enhancements will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
failure to develop enhancements that meet market needs in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
overlaying the risks associated with the company s existing products and enhancements are ongoing technological developments and rapid changes in customer requirements 
the company s future success will depend upon its ability to develop and introduce in a timely manner new products that take advantage of technological advances and respond to new customer requirements 
the development of new products is increasingly complex and uncertain  which increases the risk of delays 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new products incorporating new technology on a timely basis  or that its new products will adequately address the changing needs of the marketplace 
the company has derived most of its revenue from its core product line  progress  and other products that complement progress and are generally licensed only in conjunction with progress 
accordingly  the company s future results depend on continued market acceptance of progress and any factor adversely affecting the market for progress could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
some of the company s products require a higher level of development  distribution and support expenditures  on a percentage of revenue basis 
if revenue generated from these products becomes a greater percentage of the company s total revenue and if the expenses associated with these products on a percentage of revenue basis do not decrease  then the company s operating margins will be adversely affected 
future acquisitions as part of its business strategy  the company has made and expects to continue to make acquisitions of businesses or investments in companies that offer complementary products  services and technologies 
such acquisitions or investments involve a number of risks  including the risks of assimilating the operations and personnel of acquired companies  realizing the value of the acquired assets relative to the price paid  distraction of management from the company s ongoing businesses and potential product disruptions associated with the sale of the acquired company s products 
these factors could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
consideration paid for future acquisitions  if any  could include stock 
as a result  future acquisitions could cause dilution to existing shareholders and to earnings per share 
the company completed its acquisition of excelon in december the success of the acquisition will depend  to some extent  on the company s ability to effectively integrate the products and personnel from excelon 
if the integration efforts take longer than expected or if unforeseen contingencies and obligations are subsequently discovered  the company s business and operating results could be adversely affected 
objectstore revenue revenue from the objectstore product line  an object oriented database from excelon  has declined in recent years 
the future revenue from the objectstore product line offering will depend to a substantial degree on the company s ability both to keep existing customers and to attract and retain new customers for this product 
a significant portion of objectstore revenue historically has been derived from sales to customers in a limited number of industries  such as the telecommunications industry  some of which have been decreasing their rate of capital expenditures  including expenditures for products such as objectstore 
if revenue from sales to customers in these traditional markets continues to decline and the company is unable to create increased demand 
table of contents for objectstore in new markets  revenue from this product line could further decline and there could be a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
distribution channels and new markets future results also depend upon the company s continued successful distribution of its products through its isv channel and may be impacted by downward pressure on pricing  which may not be offset by increases in volume 
isvs utilize technology from the company to create their applications and resell the company s products along with their own applications 
while revenue from the isv channel increased in fiscal  such revenue experienced a year over year decrease in fiscal if this negative revenue trend were to reoccur in fiscal  the company s business and operating results would be adversely affected 
any other adverse effect on the isvs businesses related to competition  pricing and other factors could also have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
the company is currently developing and enhancing the sonic product set and other new products and services 
the market for web services  messaging products  other internet business to business products and application integration software is highly competitive 
many potential customers have made significant investments in proprietary or internally developed systems and would incur significant costs in switching to third party products 
global e commerce and online exchange of information on the internet and other similar open wide area networks continue to evolve 
there can be no assurance that the company s products will be successful in penetrating these new and evolving markets 
xml market acceptance extensible markup language  or xml  is an emerging standard for sharing data over the internet 
to date  the acceptance of xml has been slower than expected 
if a competing standard for sharing data over the internet was perceived to be superior to xml  the market may not continue to accept xml based products 
some of the company s products might not be compatible with this competing standard or the company might not be able to develop products using this standard in a timely manner  which could materially harm revenues  results of operation and financial condition 
competition the company experiences significant competition from a variety of sources with respect to the marketing and distribution of its products 
many of these competitors have greater financial  marketing or technical resources than the company and may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than can the company 
increased competition could make it more difficult for the company to maintain its market presence 
the marketplace for new products is intensely competitive and characterized by low barriers to entry 
as a result  new competitors possessing technological  marketing or other competitive advantages may emerge and rapidly acquire market share 
in addition  current and potential competitors may make strategic acquisitions or establish cooperative relationships among themselves or with third parties  thereby increasing their ability to deliver products that better address the needs of the company s prospective customers 
current and potential competitors also may be more successful than the company in having their products or technologies widely accepted 
there can be no assurance that the company will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors  and its failure to do so could have a material adverse effect upon the company s business  prospects  financial condition and operating results 
international operations revenue generated outside of north america represented of the company s total revenue in fiscal because a majority of the company s total revenue is derived from international operations that are primarily conducted in foreign currencies  changes in the value of these foreign currencies relative to the us dollar may affect the company s results of operations and financial position 
there can be no assurance that the company s currency hedging transactions will materially reduce the effect of fluctuation in foreign currency exchange rates on such results 
if for any reason exchange or price controls or other restrictions on the conversion of foreign currencies were imposed  the company s business could be adversely affected 
other potential risks inherent in the company s international business generally include longer payment cycles  greater difficulties in accounts receivable collection  unexpected changes in regulatory requirements  export restrictions  tariffs and other trade barriers  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  political instability  reduced protection for intellectual property rights in some countries  seasonal reductions in business activity during the summer months in europe and certain other parts of the world  economic instability in emerging markets and potentially adverse tax consequences 
any one of these factors could adversely impact the success of 
table of contents the company s international operations 
there can be no assurance that one or more of such factors will not have a material adverse effect on the company s future international operations  and  consequently  on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
taxation of extraterritorial income the company currently receives significant benefits from the extraterritorial income exclusion eti provisions of the current us tax law 
the world trade organization wto has ruled that these provisions constitute a prohibited export subsidy and that the european union may impose trade sanctions if us rules are not brought into compliance 
president bush has stated the us will bring its tax laws into compliance with the wto ruling  but the administration and congress have not decided on a solution for this issue 
it is not possible to predict what impact the wto decision will have on future results pending final resolution of these matters 
if the eti exclusion is repealed and replacement legislation is not enacted  the loss of this tax benefit  which currently provides approximately a four to six absolute percentage point reduction in the company s effective tax rate  would have a material adverse effect on the profitability of the company 
hiring and retention of skilled employees the company s future success will depend in large part upon its ability to attract and retain highly skilled technical  managerial and marketing personnel 
there is significant competition for such personnel in the software industry 
there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be successful in attracting and retaining the personnel it requires to develop new and enhanced products and to continue to grow and operate profitably 
intellectual property and proprietary rights the company s success is heavily dependent upon its proprietary software technology 
the company relies principally on a combination of contract provisions and copyright  trademark  patent and trade secret laws to protect its proprietary technology 
despite the company s efforts to protect its proprietary rights  unauthorized parties may attempt to copy aspects of the company s products or to obtain and use information that the company regards as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of the company s products is difficult 
there can be no assurance that the steps taken by the company to protect its proprietary rights will be adequate to prevent misappropriation of its technology or independent development by others of similar technology 
in addition  litigation may be necessary in the future to enforce the company s intellectual property rights  to protect the company s trade secrets  to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others  or to defend against claims of infringement 
although the company believes that its products and technology do not infringe on any existing proprietary rights of others  there can be no assurance that third parties will not assert infringement claims in the future 
such litigation could result in substantial costs and diversion of resources and could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  financial condition and operating results 
third party technology the company also utilizes certain technology which it licenses from third parties  including software which is integrated with internally developed software and used in the company s products to perform key functions 
there can be no assurance that functionally similar technology will continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms in the future  or at all 
stock price volatility the market price of the company s common stock  like that of other technology companies  is highly volatile and is subject to wide fluctuations in response to quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of technological innovations or new products by the company or its competitors  changes in financial estimates by securities analysts or other events or factors 
the company s stock price may also be affected by broader market trends unrelated to the company s performance 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company is exposed to a variety of risks  including changes in interest rates affecting the return on its investments and foreign currency fluctuations 
the company has established policies and procedures to manage its exposure to fluctuations in interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates 
exposure to market rate risk for changes in interest rates relates to the company s investment portfolio 
the company has not used derivative financial instruments in its investment portfolio 
the company places its investments with high quality issuers and has policies limiting  among other things  the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer 
the company limits default risk by purchasing only investment grade securities 
the company s investments have an average remaining maturity of less than two years and are primarily fixed rate instruments 
in addition  the company has classified all its debt securities as available for sale 
this classification reduces the income statement exposure to interest rate risk 
based on a hypothetical adverse movement in interest rates  the potential losses in future earnings  fair value of risk sensitive instruments  and cash flows are immaterial  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis 
the company has entered into foreign exchange option and forward contracts to hedge certain transactions of selected foreign currencies mainly in europe and asia pacific against fluctuations in exchange rates 
the company has not entered into foreign exchange option and forward contracts for speculative or trading purposes 
the company s accounting policies for these contracts are based on the designation of the contracts as hedging instruments 
the criteria the company uses for designating a contract as a hedge include the contract s effectiveness in risk reduction and matching of derivative instruments to the underlying transactions 
market value increases and decreases on the foreign exchange option and forward contracts are generally recognized in income in the same period as gains and losses on the underlying transactions 
the company operates in certain countries where there are limited forward currency exchange markets and thus the company has unhedged transaction exposures in these currencies 
the company generally does not hedge the net assets of its international subsidiaries 
the notional principal amount of outstanding foreign exchange option contracts at november  was million 
unrealized market value gains on such contracts were immaterial at november  based on a hypothetical adverse movement in all foreign currency exchange rates  the company s revenue would be adversely affected by approximately and the company s net income would be adversely affected by approximately excluding any offsetting positive impact from the company s ongoing hedging programs  although the actual effects may differ materially from the hypothetical analysis
