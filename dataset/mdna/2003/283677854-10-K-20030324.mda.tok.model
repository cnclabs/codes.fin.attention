the cost of constructing the new switchyards has been paid by third party users 
environmental matters the company is subject to regulation with respect to air  soil and water quality  solid waste disposal and other environmental matters by federal  state  tribal and local authorities 
those authorities govern current facility operations and have continuing jurisdiction over facility modifications 
failure to comply with these environmental regulatory requirements can result in actions by regulatory agencies or other authorities that might seek to impose on the company administrative  civil  and or criminal penalties 
in addition  unauthorized releases of pollutants or contaminants into the environment can result in costly cleanup obligations that are subject to enforcement by the regulatory agencies 
environmental regulations can change rapidly and are often difficult to predict 
while the company strives to prepare for and implement changes necessary to comply with changing environmental regulations  substantial expenditures may be required for the company to comply with such regulations in the future 
the company analyzes the costs of its obligations arising from environmental matters on an ongoing basis  and believes it has made adequate provision in its financial statements to meet such obligations 
as a result of this analysis  the company has a provision for environmental remediation obligations of approximately million as of december   which is related to clean water act compliance

table of contents construction program utility construction expenditures reflected in the following table consist primarily of expanding and updating the transmission and distribution systems and the cost of capital improvements and replacements at palo verde and other generating facilities  including the replacement of the palo verde unit steam generators and fabrication and shipment for two additional sets of steam generators 
replacement power costs expected to be incurred during replacements of palo verde steam generators are not included in construction costs 
preliminary studies indicate that the company will need additional supply side and demand side resources in to meet increasing load requirements on its system 
as a result  on january   the company released a request for proposals rfp seeking bids to supply mw of additional resources beginning in and an additional mw beginning in responses to the company s rfp are due on april  the company s estimated cash construction costs for through are approximately million 
actual costs may vary from the construction program estimates shown 
such estimates are reviewed and updated periodically to reflect changed conditions 
by year in millions by function in millions production transmission distribution general total total does not include acquisition costs for nuclear fuel 
see energy sources nuclear fuel 
does not include possible costs for additional generation 
also does not include installation of replacement generators and power uprate modifications of approximately million for palo verde units and which have yet to be approved by the palo verde participants 
energy sources general the following table summarizes the percentage contribution of nuclear fuel  natural gas  coal and purchased power to the total kwh energy mix of the company 
energy generated by wind turbines accounted for less than of the total kwh energy mix 
years ended december  power source nuclear fuel natural gas coal purchased power total 
table of contents allocated fuel and purchased power costs are generally passed through directly to customers in texas and new mexico pursuant to applicable regulations 
historical fuel costs and revenues are reconciled periodically in proceedings before the texas and new mexico commissions to determine whether a refund or surcharge based on such historical costs and revenues is necessary 
however  from october to june  a fixed fuel factor was incorporated into the company s frozen base rates in new mexico pursuant to the new mexico settlement agreement 
therefore  there were no fuel reconciliation filings before the new mexico commission during that period 
see regulation texas regulatory matters and new mexico regulatory matters 
nuclear fuel the nuclear fuel cycle for palo verde consists of the following stages the mining and milling of uranium ore to produce uranium concentrates  the conversion of the uranium concentrates to uranium hexafluoride conversion services  the enrichment of uranium hexafluoride enrichment services  the fabrication of fuel assemblies fabrication services  the utilization of the fuel assemblies in the reactors  and the storage and disposal of the spent fuel 
the palo verde participants have contracts for uranium concentrates and inventory available to meet of palo verde s uranium requirements in the palo verde participants also have contracts for conversion services and enrichment services to meet of palo verde s conversion and enrichment requirements in in  the palo verde participants have contracts to meet of enrichment requirements  of conversion requirements and of uranium requirements 
at the end of  the palo verde participants selected and approved the vendors to supply the remaining amount of uranium concentrates for and conversion services and enrichment services for according to aps  the contracts will be finalized in early for  a new enriched uranium product contract will commence that will furnish up to of palo verde s operational requirements for uranium concentrates  conversion services and enrichment services through this new contract could also provide of enrichment services in and the palo verde participants have contracts for fabrication services through for each palo verde unit 
nuclear fuel financing 
pursuant to the anpp participation agreement  the company owns an undivided interest in nuclear fuel purchased in connection with palo verde 
the company has available a total of million under a revolving credit facility that provides for both working capital and up to million for the financing of nuclear fuel 
at december   approximately million had been drawn to finance nuclear fuel 
this financing is accomplished through a trust that borrows under the facility to acquire and process the nuclear fuel 
the company is obligated to repay the trust s borrowings with interest and has secured this obligation with first mortgage collateral series bonds 
in the company s financial statements  the assets and liabilities of the trust are reported as assets and liabilities of the company 
natural gas the company manages its natural gas requirements through a combination of long term contracts and market purchases 
in  the company s natural gas requirements at the rio grande power station were met with both short term and long term natural gas purchases from various suppliers 
interstate gas is delivered under a firm transportation agreement which expires in the company anticipates it will continue to purchase natural gas at market prices on a monthly basis for a portion of the fuel needs for the rio grande power station for the near term 
to complement those monthly purchases  the company has entered into a two year gas supply contract that began in 
table of contents the company will continue to evaluate the availability of short term natural gas supplies versus long term supplies to maintain a reliable and economical supply for the rio grande power station 
natural gas for the newman and copper power stations was supplied primarily pursuant to an intrastate natural gas contract that became effective january  and was renegotiated for a period of five years ending december  the company will also continue to evaluate short term natural gas supplies to maintain a reliable and economical supply for the newman and copper power stations 
coal aps  as operating agent for four corners  purchases four corners coal requirements from a supplier with a long term lease of coal reserves owned by the navajo nation 
the coal contract expires in and can be extended for an additional years 
based upon information from aps  the company believes that four corners has sufficient reserves of coal to meet the plant s operational requirements for its useful life 
aps  on behalf of the company and the other four corners participants  is in negotiations with the supplier to extend the coal contract through to coincide with the four corners plant lease with the navajo nation 
purchased power to supplement its own generation and operating reserves  the company engages in firm and non firm power purchase arrangements which may vary in duration and amount based on evaluation of the company s resource needs and the economics of the transactions 
the company purchased mw of firm on peak energy for and mw of monthly firm on peak block energy for april through october other purchases of shorter duration were made primarily to replace the company s generation resources during planned and unplanned outages 
in  the company entered into a purchase agreement for firm energy of mw in and mw in through this agreement includes a fuel adjustment clause

table of contents regulation general in  both the texas and new mexico legislatures enacted electric utility industry restructuring laws requiring competition in certain functions of the industry and ultimately in the company s service area 
competition in new mexico was scheduled to begin on january  under the new mexico electric utility industry restructuring act of on march   however  the new mexico restructuring act was amended to delay the start of competition for five years until january   and on february   the new mexico senate passed senate bill to repeal the new mexico restructuring act 
the company cannot predict whether this pending legislation will pass the new mexico house of representatives and be signed into law by the governor of new mexico 
in texas  the company is exempt from the requirements of chapter of the public utility regulatory act pura  including utility restructuring and retail competition  until the expiration of the freeze period in august the company continues to prepare to comply with these restructuring laws and other regulatory  economic and technological changes occurring throughout the industry 
deregulation of the production of electricity and related services and increasing customer demand for lower priced electricity and other energy services have accelerated the industry s movement toward more competitive pricing and cost structures 
those competitive pressures could result in the loss of customers and diminish the ability of the company to fully recover its investment in generation assets 
in january  competition was initiated in some parts of texas 
as a result  the company may face increasing pressure on its retail rates and its rate freeze under the texas rate stipulation 
the company s results of operations and cash flows may be adversely affected if it cannot maintain its current retail rates 
federal regulatory matters federal energy regulatory commission 
the company is subject to regulation by the ferc in certain matters  including rates for wholesale power sales  transmission of electric power and the issuance of securities 
since february  the ferc has been conducting an investigation into potential manipulation of electricity prices in the western united states during and on august   the ferc initiated a federal power act fpa investigation docket no 
el into the company s wholesale power trading in the western united states during and to determine whether the company and enron engaged in misconduct and  if so  to determine potential remedies 
depending on its findings  the ferc could seek to revoke the company s market based rate authority or order refunds or disgorgements 
the company s revenue from economy sales in the western united states during and was approximately million  and net income from these sales after taxes and margin sharing with retail customers was approximately million 
intervenors in the proceeding include the california attorney general  the california public utilities commission  the california independent system operator  pacific gas and electric  the cities of burbank  california and tacoma  washington and others with similar interests 
on december   the company announced that it had reached a settlement with the ferc trial staff 
the settlement resolves all issues between the company and the trial staff 
in february  the company also reached a settlement with the california attorney general and the 
table of contents california electricity oversight board 
in addition  the california public utilities commission and pacific gas and electric agreed not to oppose the settlements 
under the terms of the settlements  the company agrees to refund a total of million of revenues it earned on wholesale power transactions 
this amount has been accrued as a liability as of december  the company also agrees to make wholesale sales pursuant to its cost of service rate authority rather than its market based rate authority from december  through december  during  economy sales prices were below the rates the company would be allowed to charge under its cost of service tariffs 
in its december testimony  the ferc trial staff asserts that the company violated sections and of the fpa by not filing a tariff with the ferc to collect monies with respect to its parking and lending services and its supplemental services provided for enron and in not offering these services on an open access  non discriminatory basis 
the trial staff also contends that the company violated section of the fpa by allegedly ceding control over its generation to enron when enron ran the company s real time marketing desk and by entering into an agreement with enron whereby enron received valuable information from the company as well as compensation based on calculated cost savings 
additionally  the trial staff maintains that the company engaged in activities that it describes as ricochet or megawatt laundering 
the trial staff calculates the company earned approximately million on an after tax basis from sales above the company s cost based rate authority 
finally  the trial staff submits that the company may have violated ferc order no 
open access transmission requirements by not posting generation swap transactions it performed with enron and by not filing tariffs for parking  lending and hubbing services performed for enron 
in the interest of settlement  the parties to the settlement agreed to make no determination regarding any violation of legal provisions 
the settlements are subject to ferc approval  and in the event the ferc does not approve the settlements  neither the company  the trial staff nor the settling intervenors will be bound by their terms 
the company has denied and will continue to deny the allegations made by ferc trial staff and the intervenors 
the city of tacoma  washington filed testimony on december  and its witness concurred with the trial staff s findings and the proposed remedy regarding the company 
the company s direct testimony  filed february   and rebuttal testimony  filed march   support the settlements and respond to issues raised by the trial staff and intervenors 
the company s testimony asserts that it has not violated the fpa or any ferc regulation 
the hearing is set to begin april  rtos 
on december   the ferc approved its final rule order on regional transmission organizations rtos 
order strongly encourages  but does not require  public utilities to form and join rtos 
order also proposes rto startup by december  the company is an active participant in the development of westconnect  formerly known as the desert southwest transmission and reliability operator 
the company believes westconnect will qualify as an rto under order the company intends  subject to the resolution of outstanding issues  to participate in westconnect 
as a participating transmission owner  the company will transfer operational authority of its transmission system to westconnect subject to receiving any necessary regulatory approvals 
the westconnect proposal was submitted to the ferc on october  on october   ferc issued an order indicating that the westconnect proposal satisfied  or with certain modifications would satisfy  the ferc requirements for an rto under order westconnect will continue to work with the ferc and two other proposed rtos in the west to achieve seamless operations

deregulation 
pura chapter required an investor owned electric utility to separate its power generation activities from its transmission and distribution activities by january   and on that date  retail competition was instituted in some parts of texas 
in the case of the company  however  the exemption from pura chapter specifically recognized and preserved the company s texas rate stipulation and texas settlement agreement by  among other things  exempting the company s texas service area from retail competition until the end of the freeze period 
at the end of the freeze period  the company will be subject to all the applicable provisions of the law 
at that time  the company will be permitted to continue to recover nuclear decommissioning costs through a non bypassable customer charge in its distribution rates 
under its exemption from pura chapter  however  the company will have no claim for stranded cost recovery 
stated simply  stranded costs are the positive difference  if any  between the book value of electric generating assets  including long term purchase power contracts  and the market value of those assets 
the company believes that its continued ability to provide bundled electric service at current rates in its texas service area will allow the company to collect substantially all of its texas jurisdictional stranded costs because i the company revalued its utility plant under fresh start accounting in so that the generation assets would reflect projected market values in a deregulated environment and ii the company does not have power purchase contracts that extend beyond although the company is not subject to the requirements of pura chapter until the expiration of the freeze period  the company sought texas commission approval of the company s corporate restructuring in anticipation of complying with the restructuring requirements of the new mexico restructuring act 
in december  the texas commission approved the company s corporate restructuring plan 
however  the amended new mexico restructuring act now prohibits the separation of the company s generation activities from its transmission and distribution activities before 
table of contents september  both texas and new mexico legislatures will be in session in  and either or both could amend their respective restructuring laws during these sessions 
however  the company cannot predict whether any changes to the current restructuring laws will be made  and how or when such changes  if any  would be implemented 
texas rate stipulation and texas settlement agreement 
the texas rate stipulation and texas settlement agreement govern the company s rates for its texas customers but do not deprive the texas regulatory authorities of their jurisdiction over the company during the freeze period 
however  the texas commission determined that the rate freeze is in the public interest and results in just and reasonable rates 
further  the signatories to the texas rate stipulation other than the texas office of public utility counsel and the state of texas agreed not to seek to initiate an inquiry into the reasonableness of the company s rates during the freeze period and to support the company s entitlement to rates at the freeze level throughout the freeze period 
during the freeze period  the company is precluded from seeking base rate increases in texas  even in the event of increased operating or capital costs 
in the event of a merger  the parties to the texas rate stipulation retain all rights provided in the texas rate stipulation  the right to participate as a party in any proceeding related to the merger  and the right to pursue a reduction in rates below the freeze level to the extent of post merger synergy savings 
fuel 
although the company s base rates are frozen in texas  pursuant to texas commission rules and the texas rate stipulation  the company can request adjustments to its fuel factor to more accurately reflect projected energy costs associated with the provision of electricity as well as seek recovery of past undercollections of fuel revenues 
in october  the texas commission approved the texas fuel settlement between the company and the parties which had intervened  including the city of el paso  which increased the texas fuel factor to per kwh an increase of per kwh 
this factor was implemented on an interim basis in april the texas fuel settlement also provides for the surcharge of underrecovered fuel costs as of december  of approximately million plus interest over an month period 
the fuel surcharge was implemented on an interim basis beginning with the first billing cycle in june the company terminated its interim fuel surcharge with the last billing cycle in november as expected  having collected million  or of the million it had anticipated would be collected over the month period 
on july   the company filed a petition with the texas commission to reconcile the company s fuel and purchased power expenses and associated revenues for the three year period january  through december  this filing was made pursuant to texas commission rules  which require companies to submit a fuel reconciliation at least every three years 
among other things  the company s petition included a request for i a reconciliation of the company s texas jurisdiction eligible fuel costs for the period of million and fuel factor revenues of million  ii recovery of palo verde performance rewards of million  including interest  for achieving a three period average capacity factor of the three periods used for this reward amount  each of which consists of a three year rolling average  are the periods ended in  and which  pursuant to the texas fuel settlement  the texas commission shall treat as reconciled and iii authority to recover its net underrecovered fuel expenses and palo verde performance rewards  including interest  through a surcharge which would not overlap or exceed the interim surcharge 

table of contents the company previously agreed to contribute of the palo verde performance rewards to fund programs for bill payment assistance and demand side management programs in its texas service territory 
the texas commission staff  local regulatory authorities such as the city of el paso and customers are entitled to intervene in a fuel reconciliation proceeding and to challenge the prudence of fuel and purchased power expenses 
the company anticipates that it will take nine to twelve months to receive a final order from the texas commission 
because of the length of time necessary to conclude the reconciliation proceeding and to subsequently collect the underrecovered amount  the company has classified as a non current asset approximately million of underrecovered fuel expense subject to the reconciliation proceeding 
palo verde performance standards 
the texas commission established performance standards for the operation of palo verde  pursuant to which each palo verde unit is evaluated annually to determine whether its three year rolling average capacity factor entitles the company to a reward or subjects it to a penalty 
the capacity factor is calculated as the ratio of actual generation to maximum possible generation 
if the capacity factor  as measured on a station wide basis for any consecutive month period  should fall below  the texas commission can also reconsider the rate treatment of palo verde  regardless of the provisions of the texas rate stipulation and the texas settlement agreement 
the removal of palo verde from rate base could have a significant negative impact on the company s revenues and financial condition 
under the performance standards as modified by the texas fuel settlement  the company has calculated the performance awards for the reporting periods ending in and to be approximately million and million  respectively 
these rewards will be included  along with energy costs incurred and revenues billed  as part of the texas commission s review during a future periodic fuel reconciliation proceeding as discussed above 
performance rewards are not recorded on the company s books until the texas commission has ordered a final determination in a fuel proceeding 
performance penalties are recorded when assessed as probable by the company 
new mexico regulatory matters the new mexico commission has jurisdiction over the company s rates and services in new mexico and over certain other activities of the company  including prior approval of the issuance  assumption or guarantee of securities 
the new mexico commission s decisions are subject to judicial review 
the largest city in the company s new mexico service territory is las cruces 
deregulation 
in march  the new mexico legislature amended the new mexico restructuring act to postpone deregulation in new mexico until january   and to prohibit the separation of a utility s transmission and distribution activities from its existing generation activities prior to september  the amended new mexico restructuring act permits utilities to form holding companies subject to new mexico approval with conditions 
it also allows the utility  until corporate separation occurs  to participate in unregulated generation activities if the generation is not intended to serve new mexico retail customers 
the amended new mexico restructuring act prohibiting the separation of the company s generation activities from its transmission and distribution activities prior to september  may conflict with the texas restructuring law requiring separation of those activities after the expiration of the freeze period in august the company anticipates that it will make a filing with the new mexico commission in requesting approval to separate the company s generation activities 
table of contents from its transmission and distribution activities to allow the company to restructure in order to comply with texas restructuring requirements 
on february   the new mexico senate passed senate bill to repeal the new mexico restructuring act 
the company cannot predict whether such legislation will pass the new mexico house of representatives and be signed into law by the governor of new mexico 
fuel 
the new mexico settlement agreement approved by the new mexico commission in september eliminated the then existing fuel factor of per kwh by incorporating it into frozen base rates 
accordingly  the company was required to absorb any increases in fuel and purchased power energy expenses related to its new mexico retail customers until new rates were implemented subsequent to the end of the rate freeze on april  the average energy expenses incurred for new mexico jurisdictional customers exceeded this fuel factor by a substantial amount 
therefore  on april   the company filed a petition with the new mexico commission proposing a settlement that would implement a new incremental fixed fuel and purchased power factor fuel factor effective june   while leaving the existing fuel factor as part of the still frozen base rates  and reinstate for a two year period a fuel and purchased power adjustment clause in lieu of a base rate increase the new mexico fuel factor agreement 
the new mexico commission entered its final order on january  implementing the new mexico fuel factor agreement and setting an initial incremental fixed fuel factor of per kwh 
on february   the company filed a petition with the new mexico commission for an incremental fuel factor decrease to per kwh 
the new mexico commission issued an order approving that decrease on february  this new incremental fuel factor was implemented as of the first billing cycle in march at the end of the two year freeze period in june  the company will be required to file i a reconciliation of fuel revenues and expenses and ii a base rate case 
at that time the new mexico fuel factor will be reset to an amount equal to the actual energy expenses for the first six months of this reset fuel factor will remain in effect until the completion of the rate case which could take ten to twelve months to prosecute
