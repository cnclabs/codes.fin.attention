critical accounting estimates the company prepares its consolidated financial statements for inclusion in this report in accordance with accounting principles that are generally accepted in the united states gaap 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for a comprehensive discussion of the company s significant accounting policies 
gaap represents a comprehensive set of accounting and disclosure rules and requirements  the application of which requires management judgements and estimates including  in certain circumstances  choices between acceptable gaap alternatives 
following is a discussion of the company s most critical accounting estimates  judgements and uncertainties that are inherent in the company s application of gaap accounting for oil and gas producing activities 
the accounting for and disclosure of oil and gas producing activities requires the company s management to choose between gaap alternatives and to make judgements about estimates of future uncertainties 
successful efforts method of accounting 
the company utilizes the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities as opposed to the alternate acceptable full cost method 
in general  the company believes that  during periods of active exploration  net assets and net income are more conservatively measured under the successful efforts method of accounting for oil and gas producing activities than under the full cost method 
the critical difference between the successful efforts method of accounting and the full cost method is as follows under the successful efforts method  exploratory dry holes and geological and geophysical exploration costs are charged against earnings during the periods in which they occur  whereas  under the full cost method of accounting  such costs and expenses are capitalized as assets  pooled with the costs of successful wells and charged against the earnings of future periods as a component of depletion expense 
during  and  the company recognized exploration  abandonment  geological and geophysical expense of million  million and million  respectively  under the successful efforts method 
proved reserve estimates 
estimates of the company s proved reserves included in this report are prepared in accordance with gaap and sec guidelines 
the accuracy of a reserve estimate is a function of o the quality and quantity of available data  o the interpretation of that data  o the accuracy of various mandated economic assumptions  and o the judgment of the persons preparing the estimate 
the company s proved reserve information included in this report as of december  was based on evaluations audited by independent petroleum engineers with respect to the company s major properties and prepared by the company s engineers with respect to all other properties 
the company s proved reserve information included in this report as of december  and was based on evaluations prepared by the company s engineers 
estimates prepared by other third parties may be higher or lower than those included herein 
because these estimates depend on many assumptions  all of which may substantially differ from future actual results  reserve estimates will be different from the quantities of oil and gas that are ultimately recovered 
in addition  results of drilling  testing and production after the date of an estimate may justify material revisions to the estimate 
the company s stockholders should not assume that the present value of future net cash flows is the current market value of the company s estimated proved reserves 
in accordance with sec requirements  the company based the estimated discounted future net cash flows from proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may be materially higher or lower than the prices and costs as of the date of the estimate 
the company s estimates of proved reserves materially impact depletion expense 
if the estimates of proved reserves decline  the rate at which the company records depletion expense will increase  reducing future net income 
such a decline may result from lower market prices  which may make it uneconomic to drill for and produce higher cost fields 
in addition  the decline in proved reserve estimates may impact the outcome of the company s assessment of its oil and gas producing properties for impairment 
impairment of proved oil and gas properties 
the company reviews its long lived proved properties to be held and used whenever management judges that events or circumstances indicate that the recorded carrying value of the properties may not be recoverable 
management assesses whether or not an impairment provision is necessary based upon management s outlook of future commodity prices and net cash flows that may be generated by the properties 
proved oil and gas properties are reviewed for impairment by depletable pool  which is the lowest level at which depletion of proved properties is calculated 
impairment of unproved oil and gas properties 
management periodically assesses individually significant unproved oil and gas properties for impairment  on a project by project basis 
management s assessment of the results of exploration activities  commodity price outlooks  planned future sales or expiration of all or a portion of such projects impact the amount and timing of impairment provisions 
assessments of functional currencies 
management determines the functional currencies of the company s subsidiaries based on an assessment of the currency of the economic environment in which a subsidiary primarily realizes and expends its operating revenues  costs and expenses 
the us dollar is the functional currency of all of the company s international operations except canada 
the assessment of functional currencies can have a significant impact on periodic results of operations and financial position 
argentine economic and currency measures 
the accounting for and remeasurement of the company s argentine balance sheets as of december  and reflect management s assumptions regarding some uncertainties unique to argentina s current economic situation 
see note b of notes to consolidated financial statements included in item financial statements and supplementary data for a description of the assumptions utilized in the preparation of these financial statements 
the argentine economic and political situation continues to evolve and the argentine government may enact future regulations or policies that  when finalized and adopted  may materially impact  among other items  i the realized prices the company receives for the commodities it produces and sells  ii the timing of repatriations of excess cash flow to the company s corporate headquarters in the united states  iii the company s asset valuations  and iv peso denominated monetary assets and liabilities 
deferred tax asset valuations 
management periodically assesses the probability of recovery of recorded deferred tax assets based on its assessment of future earnings outlooks by tax jurisdiction 
such estimates are inherently imprecise 
many assumptions are utilized in the assessments that may prove to be materially incorrect in the future

 accounting for asset retirement obligations sfas 
sfas amends statement of financial accounting standards no 
 financial accounting and reporting by oil and gas producing companies sfas to require that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation be recognized in the period in which it is incurred if a reasonable estimate of fair value can be made

results of operations oil and gas revenues 
revenues from oil and gas operations totaled million during  as compared to million during and million during  representing a percent decrease from to the revenue decrease from to was due to year on year worldwide average gas  ngl and oil price declines of percent  percent and five percent  respectively  including the effects of gas and oil price hedges  and an eight percent decline in worldwide oil production  offset by worldwide ngl and gas production increases of four percent and two percent  respectively 
the revenue decrease from to was due to a four percent decline in boe production and a percent decline in ngl price  partially offset by a percent increase in gas price  including the effects of gas hedges 
the declines in sales volumes were primarily attributable to normal well production declines

the commodity prices that the company reports are based on the market price received for the commodities adjusted by the results of the company s hedging activities 
the company utilizes commodity derivative contracts swaps and collars in order to i reduce the effect of price volatility on the commodities the company produces and sells  ii support the company s annual capital budgeting and expenditure plans and iii reduce commodity price risk associated with certain capital projects 
the effective portions of changes in the fair values of the company s commodity price hedge derivatives are deferred as increases or decreases to stockholders equity until the underlying hedged transaction occurs 
consequently  changes in the effective portions of commodity price hedge derivatives add volatility to the company s reported stockholders equity until the hedge derivative matures or is terminated
