item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the company is a leading provider of low cost scheduled airline services and charter airline services to value oriented travelers  and to the us military 
the company  through its principal subsidiary  ata  has been operating for years and is the tenth largest us airline in terms of capacity and traffic 
the company recorded an operating loss of million  and a loss available to common shareholders of million  for the year ended december  results of operations in were significantly impacted by non cash aircraft and goodwill impairment charges  and an adjustment to reduce a receivable for us government grant compensation  such charges totaled million 
consolidated revenues were approximately unchanged in from  although consolidated available seat miles asms increased between years  resulting in a decline in revenue per available seat mile rasm 
this reflects a very weak pricing environment experienced by the company and the entire airline industry in declining unit revenues are a result of excess industry capacity in the scheduled service business  which began as a direct result of the terrorist attacks of september   but has continued with the weakened economy 
the company also believes that consumer confidence continues to be affected by both the unsettled economic climate in the united states  and by conflict in the middle east and other geopolitical uncertainties 
the company expects continued weakness in unit revenue throughout the company s unit costs remained among the lowest of the major airlines in the company is continuing its efforts to further reduce operating costs  and expects to continue to realize additional cost savings from the ongoing deliveries of its new fleet of boeing and boeing aircraft 
the company also expects  however  that fuel costs will remain very high as compared to long term average energy prices  and that these prices will adversely affect the company s results of operations in due to the lack of available credit  the company does not have in place any fuel price hedge contracts for expected consumption of jet fuel 
for the fiscal year  the company currently expects that it may break even or earn a small operating profit 
however  significant uncertainties continue to exist with respect to unit revenues and fuel prices  both of which may be adversely affected by geopolitical and economic events  including the uncertain outcome of the two major airline bankruptcies filed in and the unknown impact of the conflict in the middle east  which are not within the company s direct control 
therefore  the company can provide no assurance that it will break even or return to profitability in critical accounting policies management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities 
certain significant accounting policies applied in the preparation of the financial statements require management to make difficult  subjective or complex judgments  and are considered critical accounting policies by the company 
the company has identified the following areas as critical accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
passenger ticket sales are initially recorded as a component of air traffic liability 
revenue derived from ticket sales is recognized at the time service is provided 
tickets that are sold but not flown on the scheduled travel date can be exchanged and reused for another flight  up to a year from the date of sale  or can be refunded if the ticket is sold under a refundable tariff 
a small percentage of tickets or partially used tickets expire unused 
the majority of the company s tickets sold are nonrefundable in cash  which is the primary source of forfeited tickets 
the company records estimates of earned revenue in the period tickets are originally sold  for a percentage of those sales which are expected to expire unused over the period of ticket validity 
these estimates are based upon historical experience over many years  with particular emphasis given to expiration experience in more recent years 
the company has consistently applied this accounting method to estimate revenue from future unused and expired tickets 
revenue accruals for expired and unused tickets are routinely compared to actual expired and unused ticket experience to validate the accuracy of the company s estimates with respect to forfeited tickets  and accrual adjustments resulting from these comparisons have not been material to the company s results of operations 
if  however  customer behavior changes from historical patterns in the manner in which tickets are purchased and used  it is possible that the company s revenue accruals for unused and expired tickets may require material future adjustments in order to account for those changes in customer behavior 
impairments of long lived assets 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which superseded fas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
the company continues to account for aircraft and related assets that were impaired prior to january  and classified as held for sale under the provisions of fas  which is required by fas both fas and fas require that whenever events and circumstances indicate that the company may not be able to recover the net book value of its productive assets  that the undiscounted estimated future cash flows must be compared to the net book value of these productive assets to determine if impairment is indicated 
fas and fas require that assets deemed impaired be written down to their estimated fair value through a charge to earnings 
fas and fas state that fair values may be estimated using discounted cash flow analysis or quoted market prices  together with other available information 
the company had been performing impairment reviews in accordance with fas on the lockheed l and and the boeing fleets since the end of  and both fleets initially became impaired under fas subsequent to the terrorist attacks of september  the company primarily used discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the lockheed l and fleet  and used quoted market prices to estimate the fair value of the boeing fleet 
in  the company decided to retire one of its five lockheed l aircraft earlier than originally planned 
this event caused the company to consider whether the remaining four aircraft and related assets in this fleet were impaired 
the company performed an impairment analysis on the lockheed l fleet and related assets in accordance with fas  and determined that this fleet was not impaired 
the company primarily used discounted cash flow analysis to estimate the fair value of the lockheed l fleet 
the application of fas and fas required the exercise of significant judgment and the preparation of numerous significant estimates 
although the company believes that its estimates  with regards to future cash flows  were reasonable and based upon all available information  they required substantial judgments and were based upon material assumptions about future events 
such estimates were significant in determining the amount of the impairment charge to be recorded  which could have been materially different under different sets of assumptions and estimates 
goodwill accounting 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december   under which goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  but will be subject to annual impairment reviews 
a fas impairment review involves a two step process 
step one compares the fair value of a reporting unit determined through market quotes or the present value of estimated future cash flows with its carrying amount assets less liabilities  including goodwill 
if the estimated fair value exceeds the carrying amount  goodwill of the reporting unit is considered not impaired  and step two of the impairment test is not necessary 
if the carrying amount of a reporting unit exceeds its estimated fair value  the second step of the goodwill impairment test is then performed  which compares the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill determined in accordance with purchase accounting  with the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill 
if the carrying amount of the reporting unit s goodwill exceeds the implied fair value of the goodwill  an impairment loss is recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
if an impairment loss is recognized  the adjusted carrying amount of the goodwill becomes the new accounting basis for future impairment tests 
fas required companies to complete by june   a transitional goodwill impairment review as of the date of adoption of the statement  which was january  the company s recorded goodwill as of january  was related to its ata leisure corp  atalc  ata cargo and chicago express subsidiaries acquired in during the transitional impairment review  the company identified atalc  ata cargo and chicago express as the reporting units as defined by fas the fair values of all of the company s reporting units were estimated using discounted future cash flows  since market quotes were not readily available 
in all transitional reviews  the estimated fair value was higher than the carrying amount of each reporting unit  and thus no impairment was indicated 
in addition to the transitional goodwill impairment review  fas required companies to perform the first of their annual goodwill impairment reviews during the company performed its first annual impairment test in the fourth quarter of by this time  the company had outsourced the management of two of its atalc brands to the mark travel corporation mtc 
the company continued in to manage the other atalc brands  including the key tours canadian rail programs  key tours las vegas ground operations  and the kodiak call center collectively kti brands 
see further discussion in financial statements and supplementary data notes to consolidated financial statements note segment disclosures 
based upon guidance provided in fas  the company determined that the reporting unit previously identified as atalc during the transition test  was more appropriately defined as two reporting units  after giving effect to the operational changes resulting from the outsourcing agreement completed in the middle of in its first annual goodwill impairment review  the company determined that the goodwill related to chicago express  ata cargo and the mtc brands was unimpaired 
however  the estimated fair value of the kti brands was determined to be lower than the carrying amount  and an impairment loss of million was therefore recorded in the fourth quarter of all of the company s fair value estimates involved highly subjective judgments on the part of management  including the amounts of cash flows to be received  their estimated duration  and perceived risk as reflected in selected discount rates 
in some cases  cash flows were estimated without the benefit of historical data  although historical data was used where available 
although the company believes its estimates and judgments to be reasonable  different assumptions and judgments might have resulted in additional impairment charges

rpms are an industry measure of the total seat capacity actually sold by the company 
b available seat miles asms represent the number of seats available for sale to revenue passengers multiplied by the number of miles those seats are flown 
asms are an industry measure of the total seat capacity offered for sale by the company  whether sold or not 
c passenger load factor is the percentage derived by dividing rpms by asms 
passenger load factor is relevant to the evaluation of scheduled service because incremental passengers normally provide incremental revenue and profitability when seats are sold individually 
in the case of commercial charter and military government charter  load factor is less relevant because an entire aircraft is sold by the company instead of individual seats 
since both costs and revenues are largely fixed for these types of charter flights  changes in load factor have less impact on business unit profitability 
consolidated load factors and scheduled service load factors for the company are shown in the appropriate tables for industry comparability  but load factors for individual charter businesses are omitted from applicable tables 
d passengers enplaned are the number of revenue passengers who occupied seats on the company s flights 
this measure is also referred to as passengers boarded 
e revenue per asm expressed in cents is total operating revenue divided by total asms 
this measure is also referred to as rasm 
rasm measures the company s unit revenue using total available seat capacity 
in the case of scheduled service  rasm is a measure of the combined impact of load factor and yield see g for the definition of yield 
f cost per asm expressed in cents is total operating expense divided by total asms 
this measure is also referred to as casm 
casm measures the company s unit cost using total available seat capacity 
g revenue per rpm expressed in cents is total operating revenue divided by total rpms 
this measure is also referred to as yield 
yield is relevant to the evaluation of scheduled service because yield is a measure of the average price paid by customers purchasing individual seats 
yield is less relevant to the commercial charter and military government charter businesses because the entire aircraft is sold at one time for one price 
consolidated yields and scheduled service yields are shown in the appropriate tables for industry comparability  but yields for individual charter businesses are omitted from applicable tables 
operating revenues total operating revenues in increased to billion  as compared to billion in this increase was due to a million increase in scheduled service revenue  a million increase in military government charter revenues and a million increase in other revenues  partially offset by a million decrease in commercial charter revenues and a million decrease in ground package revenues

revenue per segment is a broad measure of the average price obtained for all flight segments flown by passengers in the company s scheduled service route network 
i commercial charter contracts generally provide that the tour operator will reimburse the company for certain fuel cost increases  which  when earned  are accounted for as additional revenue 
a rasm calculation  excluding the impact of fuel reimbursements  is provided as a separate measure of unit revenue changes 
j military government reimbursements to the company are calculated based upon a cost plus formula  including an assumed average fuel price for each contract year 
if actual fuel prices differ from the contract rate  revenues are adjusted up or down to neutralize the impact of the change to the company 
a separate rasm calculation is provided  excluding the impact of the fuel price adjustments 
scheduled service revenues 
scheduled service revenues increased in to million from million in scheduled service revenues comprised of consolidated revenues in  as compared to in while total scheduled service revenues and asms increased  scheduled service rasm declined from cents in to cents in the declining unit revenues experienced by the company were a result of continuing overcapacity in the airline industry 
customer demand declined abruptly immediately after the terrorist attacks of september   and demand has also been lowered by the slowing pace of economic activity in the united states 
the company does not expect any significant recovery in demand for its services until after the uncertainty of the conflict in the middle east has been resolved  and economic growth returns 
scheduled service departures grew in  compared to the asm growth of 
this reflects the growth of the chicago express saab b fleet from aircraft as of december  to aircraft as of december  the additional saab aircraft generated significantly more departures  but because the aircraft seats only passengers and operates on short stage length flights  the increase in asms was not as great as departures 
approximately of the company s scheduled service capacity was generated by the chicago midway market in  as compared to in the hawaiian market generated approximately of total scheduled service capacity in  as compared to in another of total scheduled service capacity was generated in the indianapolis market in  as compared to in the company anticipates that its chicago midway operation will continue to represent a substantial proportion of its scheduled service business in the future 
the company also anticipates further growth at chicago midway  which will be accomplished in conjunction with the completion of new terminal and gate facilities at the chicago midway airport 
once all construction is complete in  the company expects to occupy at least jet gates and one commuter aircraft gate at the new airport concourses 
a federal inspection service fis facility was completed at chicago midway in the first quarter of  which allowed the company to begin nonstop international services from chicago midway 
also contributing to the growth at chicago midway is chicago express  which has been performing well as a feeder of passengers to ata s jet system 
the company operated peak daily jet and commuter departures from chicago midway and served destinations on a nonstop basis in  as compared to peak daily jet and commuter departures and nonstop destinations in the company s declining capacity in the hawaiian market was primarily attributable to the transition to the smaller seat boeing aircraft from the wide body lockheed l aircraft for certain west coast hawaii routes beginning in mid the company provided nonstop services in both years from los angeles  phoenix and san francisco to both honolulu and maui  with connecting service between honolulu and maui 
from june to september  the company operated seasonal service to lihue from los angeles and san francisco 
the company s growth in the indianapolis market is primarily attributable to the addition of limited jet service between indianapolis and chicago midway in the second quarter of  and the addition of nonstop service to new york laguardia and phoenix beginning in the third quarter of commercial charter revenues 
commercial charter revenues decreased to million in from million in commercial charter revenues accounted for of consolidated revenues in  as compared to in the majority of the decline in commercial charter revenues was due to the retirement of certain lockheed l and boeing aircraft that the company has traditionally used in commercial charter flying 
since aircraft utilization number of productive hours of flying per aircraft each month is typically much lower for commercial charter  as compared to scheduled service flying  the company s replacement fleets of new boeing and boeing aircraft are economically disadvantaged when used in the charter business  because of their higher fixed ownership cost 
consequently  the company expects its commercial charter revenues to continue to decline as the fleet supporting this business continues to shrink through aircraft retirements 
the decrease in commercial charter rasm in  as compared to  was due to the same economic and geopolitical factors which have reduced scheduled service unit revenues between years 
the company currently expects that commercial charter will represent a less significant source of future revenues  especially after the end of when a contract with a major customer expires 
military government charter revenues 
military government charter revenue increased to million in from million in military government charter revenue accounted for of consolidated revenues in  as compared to in the increase in revenue and rasm for military government charter revenues in was due primarily to rate increases awarded for the contract year ended september   based upon cost data submitted to the us military by the company and other air carriers providing these services 
the company earned million in the contract year ended september   a increase as compared to million earned in the preceding contract year ended september  the company renewed its us military contract for the fiscal year beginning october   although the reimbursement rate was nearly unchanged as compared to the prior contract year 
ground package revenues 
the company earns ground package revenues through the sale of hotel  car rental and cruise accommodations in conjunction with the company s air transportation product 
the company markets these ground packages through its ambassadair and atalc subsidiaries 
ambassadair travel club offers tour guide accompanied vacation packages to its approximately  individual and family members 
atalc offers numerous ground accommodations to the general public  which are marketed through travel agents  as well as directly by the company 
in  ground package revenues decreased to million  as compared to million in this decline in ground package sales and related ground package costs is primarily due to the company s july  outsourcing of the management and marketing of its ata vacations and travel charter international brands to mtc 
under that outsourcing agreement  mtc directly sells ground arrangements to customers who also purchase charter or scheduled service air transportation from the company 
therefore  ground package sales and related ground package costs are no longer recorded by the company for ata vacations and travel charter international 
other revenues 
other revenues are comprised of the consolidated revenues of certain affiliated companies  together with miscellaneous categories of revenue associated with operations of the company  such as cancellation and miscellaneous service fees  ambassadair travel club membership dues and cargo revenue 
other revenues increased to million in  as compared to million in  primarily due to an increase in cancellation and administrative fee revenues 
operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits include the cost of salaries and wages paid to the company s employees  together with the company s cost of employee benefits and payroll related local  state and federal taxes 
salaries  wages and benefits expense in increased to million  as compared to million in the increase in salaries  wages and benefits primarily reflects the impact of the company s amended collective bargaining agreement with the company s cockpit crewmembers  who are represented by alpa 
the company recorded million in for a signing bonus as provided by the amended contract 
cockpit crewmember contract rate increases became effective july  the company also incurred increasing costs in for employee medical and workers compensation benefits 
the company expects future salaries  wages and benefits costs to be significantly increased by the amended cockpit crewmember contract 
the amended contract is expected to increase cockpit crewmembers average salaries by approximately over the four year contract period 
additionally  the amended contract provides for expanded retirement benefits for cockpit crewmembers 
fuel and oil 
fuel and oil expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in although total jet block hours increased in  as compared to  the company consumed fewer gallons of jet fuel for flying operations 
this decrease was primarily due to the addition of boeing and boeing aircraft to the company s fleet beginning in may these aircraft replaced certain less fuel efficient boeing and lockheed l aircraft  which were retired from revenue service 
the decrease in fuel burn  due to the new aircraft  resulted in a decrease in fuel and oil expense of approximately million 
also contributing to the decline in fuel expense was the decrease in the company s average cost per gallon of jet fuel consumed of  resulting in an additional savings in fuel and oil expense of approximately million 
periodically  the company has entered into fuel price hedge contracts to reduce the risk of fuel price fluctuations 
during  the company recorded gains of million on these hedge contacts  as compared to losses of million in as of december   the company had no outstanding fuel hedge agreements 
since december   the cost per gallon of jet fuel has increased approximately based on march  market prices 
continued increases in the cost of fuel will adversely affect the company in aircraft rentals 
the company s operating leases require periodic cash payments that vary in amount and frequency 
the company accounts for aircraft rentals expense in equal monthly amounts over the life of each operating lease 
as of december  and december   the company had recorded million and million  respectively  of prepaid aircraft rent under its operating leases 
aircraft rentals expense in increased to million from million in the increase was mainly attributable to the delivery of leased boeing and leased boeing aircraft between may and december handling  landing and navigation fees 
handling and landing fees include the costs incurred by the company at airports to land and service its aircraft and to handle passenger check in  security  cargo and baggage where the company elects to use third party contract services in lieu of its own employees 
where the company uses its own employees to perform ground handling functions  the resulting cost appears within salaries  wages and benefits 
air navigation fees are incurred when the company s aircraft fly over certain foreign airspace 
handling  landing and navigation fees increased by to million in  as compared to million in the increase in handling  landing and navigation fees between years was primarily due to a increase in system wide jet departures 
the company also incurred approximately million in additional airport security costs associated with increased security requirements implemented after the terrorist attacks on september  depreciation and amortization 
depreciation reflects the periodic expensing of the recorded cost of owned airframes and engines  leasehold improvements and rotable parts for all fleet types  together with other property and equipment owned by the company 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in the in and  the company retired eight lockheed l aircraft from revenue service 
during the fourth quarter of  the company also determined that the remaining fleet of lockheed l and aircraft  rotable parts and inventory was impaired 
these assets were classified as held for use in accordance with fas  requiring them to be recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value at the time of impairment  which is the new asset basis to be depreciated over their estimated remaining useful lives 
the company recorded a further reduction in the carrying value of these assets in due to the reduced cost basis of these assets  the company recorded million less depreciation and amortization expense for this fleet in  as compared to in  the company decided to retire its boeing fleet earlier than originally planned  and these aircraft were determined to be impaired under fas boeing aircraft not already transferred to bata leasing llc bata  a joint venture with boeing capital corporation bcc  have been classified in the accompanying balance sheets as assets held for sale 
in accordance with fas  depreciation expense was not recorded after the fleet was deemed impaired and held for sale 
as a result  depreciation expense on the boeing fleet decreased by million in  as compared to partially offsetting these decreases were increased amortization of capitalized engine and airframe overhauls on the lockheed l fleet and increases in depreciation and amortization expense associated with other fleet rotable parts  owned engines and the provision for inventory obsolescence  along with fluctuations in expenses related to furniture and fixtures  computer hardware and software  and debt issue costs between periods  none of which was individually significant 
crew and other employee travel 
crew and other employee travel is primarily the cost of air transportation  hotels and per diem reimbursements to cockpit and cabin crewmembers incurred to position crews away from their bases to operate company flights throughout the world 
the cost of crew and other employee travel decreased to million in  as compared to million in this decrease was mainly due to the decrease in military and charter flights between years  which often operate to and from points remote from the company s crew bases including international destinations  thus requiring significant positioning expenditures for crewmembers on other airlines and higher hotel costs 
the decrease also reflects a decline in non crew employee travel in  as compared to  due to the company s cost cutting initiatives 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
this expense includes the cost of expendable aircraft spare parts  repairs to repairable and rotable aircraft components  contract labor for maintenance activities  and other non capitalized direct costs related to fleet maintenance  including spare engine leases  parts loan and exchange fees  and related shipping costs 
it also includes the costs incurred under hourly engine maintenance agreements the company has entered into on its boeing  boeing and saab b power plants 
these agreements provide for the company to pay monthly fees based on a specified rate per engine flight hour  in exchange for major engine overhauls and maintenance 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in the decline in maintenance  materials and repairs expense in  as compared to  was primarily attributable to a decrease in materials consumed and components repaired related to maintenance on the company s aging fleets of lockheed l and and boeing aircraft 
during and  the company placed boeing aircraft into bata  and retired eight lockheed l aircraft prior to the due dates of heavy maintenance visits 
maintenance  materials and repairs expense associated with these two fleets decreased million in  as compared to this decline in maintenance  materials and repairs was partially offset by an increase in the cost of the hourly engine maintenance agreement for the company s growing fleet of saab b propeller aircraft operated by chicago express 
in addition  the company entered into an hourly engine maintenance agreement for the boeing fleet in  which resulted in an increase in maintenance  materials and repair expense between years 
other selling expenses 
other selling expenses are comprised primarily of booking fees paid to computer reservation systems crs  credit card discount expenses incurred when selling to customers using credit cards for payment  and toll free telephone services provided to single seat and vacation package customers who contact the company directly to book reservations 
other selling expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in this increase is primarily the result of a greater portion of the company s sales being made on credit cards  and higher crs fees 
advertising 
advertising expense increased to million in  as compared to million in the company incurs advertising costs primarily to support single seat scheduled service sales 
the increase in advertising was primarily attributable to the promotion of the new scheduled service destinations added in and the promotion of low fares in a market that had less demand for air service 
the company also increased advertising in an effort to increase consumer preference for the company s enhanced product  especially in its important chicago midway hub  which included a new advertising campaign identifying the company as an honestly different airline 
passenger service 
passenger service expense includes the onboard costs of meal and non alcoholic beverage catering  the cost of alcoholic beverages and the cost of onboard entertainment programs  together with certain costs incurred for mishandled baggage and passengers inconvenienced due to flight delays or cancellations 
for and  catering represented and  respectively  of total passenger service expense 
the total cost of passenger service decreased to million in  as compared to million in approximately million of the decrease is attributable to catering expense  primarily because in the company boarded a higher ratio of scheduled service passengers to charter passengers than in scheduled service passengers are provided a significantly less expensive catering service than is provided to commercial charter and military passengers 
in addition  in the company introduced round trip catering for flights originating in chicago midway to reduce catering service charges 
in  as compared to  the company also incurred approximately million less expense for mishandled baggage and passenger inconvenience  due to significantly fewer flight delays and cancellations in insurance 
insurance expense represents the company s cost of hull and liability insurance and the costs of general insurance policies held by the company  including workers compensation insurance premiums 
the total cost of insurance increased to million in  as compared to million in liability insurance increased million in  as compared to immediately following the september  terrorist attacks  the company s insurer reduced the maximum amount of insurance coverage they would underwrite for liability to persons other than employees or passengers resulting from acts of terrorism  war  hijacking  or other similar perils war risk coverage and significantly increased their premiums for this reduced coverage 
pursuant to the air transportation safety and system stabilization act and other enabling legislation  the us government has issued supplemental war risk coverage to us air carriers  including the company  which is expected to continue through it is anticipated that after this date a commercial product for war risk coverage will become available  but the company may continue to incur significant additional costs for this coverage 
hull insurance increased million in  as compared to the increase is mainly attributable to the increase in the company s hull value between periods due to the addition of the new boeing and boeing aircraft 
the increase is also attributable to an increase in premium rates following the september  terrorist attacks 
expenses related to the company s general insurance policies increased million in  as compared to  due primarily to an increase in workers compensation premiums and claims handling fees between periods  and general increases in other miscellaneous policies between years 
ground package cost 
ground package cost is incurred by the company with hotels  car rental companies  cruise lines and similar vendors who provide ground and cruise accommodations to ambassadair and atalc customers 
ground package cost decreased to million in  as compared to million in  approximately proportional to the decrease in ground package revenues 
see the ground package revenues section above for an explanation of the decline in both ground package sales and related costs 
commissions 
the company incurs commissions expense in association with the sale by travel agents of single seats on scheduled service 
in addition  the company incurs commissions to secure some commercial and military government charter business 
commissions expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in the company experienced a decrease in commissions of million in  as compared to  attributable to commissions paid to travel agents by atalc  which is consistent with the decrease in related revenue 
in addition  scheduled service commissions decreased million in due to the elimination of standard travel agency commissions for sales made after march  the company continues to pay special travel agency commissions targeted to specific markets and periods of the year 
facilities and other rentals 
facilities and other rentals include the cost of all ground facilities that are leased by the company such as airport space  regional sales offices and general offices 
the cost of facilities and other rentals increased to million in  as compared to million in growth in facilities costs between periods was primarily attributable to facilities at airport locations required to support new scheduled service destinations added in late and  and expanded services at existing destinations 
special charges 
special charges represent direct expenses which  due to the events of september   were considered unusual in nature under the provisions of apb opinion  reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and the extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb 
special charges in were million  while no expenses were classified as special charges in the special charges were comprised primarily of costs associated with the early removal from service of the company s boeing fleet  some of which were leased  a decision made immediately after september   costs associated with the company s proposed transaction in which ata holdings corp 
would have been taken private  which was substantially complete by september   when the company lost financing as a result of the september  attacks  and expenses directly associated with the faa s temporarily mandated suspension of commercial flights on september  and for several days thereafter 
also classified as special charges were increased hull and liability insurance costs  additional advertising expense incurred as a direct result of september   interest expense related to debt incurred under the company s credit facility to provide operating cash after september   and other expenses not individually significant 
aircraft impairments and retirements 
aircraft impairment and retirement costs decreased to million in  as compared to million in in  the company decided to retire its boeing fleet earlier than originally planned  determined the aircraft and related rotable parts and inventory were impaired under fas and recorded an impairment charge 
in accordance with fas  the company continues to re evaluate current fair values of previously impaired assets  making further adjustments as deemed appropriate 
in  the company recorded asset impairment charges of million  as compared to million in  related to its remaining net book value of boeing aircraft  including those recorded as an investment in bata 
in  the company also determined that the lockheed l and fleet and related rotable parts and inventory were impaired under fas and recorded an impairment charge 
in accordance with fas  the company continues to re evaluate the current fair values of these impaired assets  making further adjustments as deemed appropriate 
in  the company recorded asset impairment charges of million  as compared to million in  related to its remaining net book value of lockheed l and aircraft and related parts 
in  the company retired three lockheed l aircraft  resulting in a charge of million  and retired one lockheed l aircraft  resulting in a charge of million 
in  the company retired three lockheed l aircraft resulting in a charge of million 
these charges were included as part of aircraft impairments and retirements 
goodwill impairment 
the company began annual goodwill impairment reviews under fas in in accordance with fas  the company determined that the fair value of the kti brands was lower than the carrying amount and a goodwill impairment loss of million was recorded in the fourth quarter of u 
s government grant 
after the terrorist attacks of september   the air transportation safety and system stabilization act act was passed  which provided for  among other things  up to billion in compensation to us air carriers for direct and incremental losses resulting from the september  terrorist attacks  and the availability of up to billion in us government guarantees of certain loans made to air carriers  which are administered by the newly established air transportation stabilization board atsb 
the company had recorded million in u 
s 
government grant compensation as of december  this estimate was based on guidance available from the dot at the time for identifying those expenses it deemed reimbursable 
throughout  the company discussed the calculation with the dot  and as of december  had reversed approximately million of the accrued government reimbursement and revised its estimate of total us government grant compensation to million

the effective tax rate applicable to was  as compared to in as of december   the company had incurred a three year cumulative loss 
because of this cumulative loss and the presumption under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states that net deferred tax assets should be fully reserved if it is more likely than not that they will not be realized through carrybacks or other tax strategies  the company has recorded a full valuation allowance against its net deferred asset of million 
this allowance adjustment  included in income tax expense  resulted in an effective tax rate of for a tax credit applicable to the loss incurred in as of december   the company had recorded an income tax refund receivable of million using a five year carryback of alternative minimum tax operating losses from to payment for this refund was received in march year ended december   versus year ended december  consolidated flight operations and financial data the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  certain key operating and financial data for the consolidated flight operations of the company

the company has served indianapolis for years through the ambassadair travel club and through scheduled service since commercial charter revenues 
commercial charter revenues accounted for of consolidated revenues in as compared to in the impact of the september  terrorist attacks was less significant on the commercial charter business than on scheduled service 
the company estimates that it lost approximately million in commercial charter revenues as a result of flight cancellations during the faa mandated air system shutdown from september until september  and decreased demand for commercial charter flights following september the majority of the decline in commercial charter revenues in  as compared to  was principally due to the retirement of certain lockheed l and boeing aircraft that the company has traditionally used in commercial charter flying

although current military flight operations of the company have not been significantly affected by the terrorist attacks of september  future operations may be significantly affected by changes in the transportation needs of the us military  possibly in association with military operations in the united states and abroad 
the decline in military revenues in  as compared to  was primarily due to changes in teaming arrangements used both by the company and some of the company s competitors in the military government charter business 
such changes reduced the fixed award flying allocated to the company for the contract year ending september  the company earned million in military government charter revenues in the contract year ended september   a reduction as compared to million earned in the preceding contract year ended september  the increase in rasm for military charter revenues in  as compared to  was due to rate increases awarded for the current contract year  based upon cost data submitted to the us military by the company and other air carriers providing these services 
operating expenses salaries  wages and benefits 
salaries  wages and benefits expense in increased to million from million in the company increased its average equivalent employees by approximately between and this annual growth rate combines employment growth in conjunction with a growing flight schedule prior to the terrorist attacks on september  offset by the employee furloughs under the company s cost cutting initiatives implemented shortly after the attacks 
by the middle of october  the company had furloughed approximately  employees as a result of a flight capacity reduction implemented after the september attacks 
as of december   the company had recalled approximately half of those employees furloughed during the fourth quarter of additionally  in may  the company replaced its contracted ground handler at its busiest airport  chicago midway  with its own ramp employees 
although this contributed to a year over year increase in salaries  wages and benefits  the company experienced a corresponding reduction in handling  landing and navigation fees  where third party handling expenses are classified 
also contributing to the increase in salaries  wages and benefits  is an increase of approximately million in benefits expenses to million in as compared to million in this increase is primarily due to increases in medical insurance claims and workers compensation costs between years 
fuel and oil 
fuel and oil expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in the company consumed fewer gallons of jet fuel for flying operations in  as compared to  which resulted in a decrease in fuel expense of approximately million between periods 
fuel consumption varies with changes in jet block hours flown  and with changes in the composition of the aircraft fleet 
the company flew  jet block hours in  as compared to  jet block hours in  a decrease of between years 
fuel consumption in was more significantly affected by the delivery of boeing aircraft and five boeing aircraft  replacing certain less fuel efficient boeing and lockheed l aircraft subsequently retired from service 
the company estimates that approximately million of the variance attributable to lower fuel consumption resulted from flying approximately  of these block hours using the new aircraft  as compared to flying those block hours with the less fuel efficient fleets 
during  the company s average cost per gallon of jet fuel consumed decreased by as compared to  resulting in a decrease in fuel and oil expense of approximately million between periods 
during and  the company entered into several fuel price hedge contracts under which the company sought to reduce the risk of fuel price fluctuations 
the company recorded losses of million on these hedge contracts in as compared to gains of million in as of december   the company had entered into swap agreements for approximately million gallons of heating oil for future delivery between january and june  which represented approximately of total expected fuel consumption in aircraft rentals 
aircraft rentals expense for increased to million  as compared to million in the company took delivery of two boeing aircraft in june and two boeing aircraft in november  all of which were financed under operating leases 
these four aircraft added million to aircraft rentals expense in  as compared to aircraft rent also increased million for  as compared to  as a result of the delivery of leased boeing and five leased boeing aircraft between may and december of also during  the company terminated leases on five boeing s which were transferred to bata 
the company also transferred seven owned boeing aircraft to bata 
subsequently  the company leased certain of those aircraft from bata under short term operating leases 
these transactions resulted in a net decrease in aircraft rent of approximately million in additional chicago express aircraft and spare engine leases generated an increase in aircraft rent expense of approximately million in  as compared to handling  landing and navigation fees 
handling  landing and navigation fees decreased by to million in as compared to million in  although the total number of system wide jet departures between and increased by to  from  the decrease in handling  landing and navigation fees is primarily due to the reduction in commercial and military government charter flying between years much of which is operated to and from international airports  since international handling and landing fees are generally more expensive than at domestic us airports  and air navigation fees apply only to international flying 
in  international departures were  a reduction of as compared to international departures of  in the company also recorded million less in de icing expense in due to relatively milder weather as compared to depreciation and amortization 
depreciation and amortization expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in during the first nine months of  the company was depreciating the l and fleet assuming a common retirement date of however  during  the company decided to retire several of these aircraft as of their next scheduled heavy maintenance check 
during the first nine months of  the company retired three l aircraft from revenue service in this manner  recording a loss on disposal of million for these aircraft in aircraft impairments and retirements 
during the fourth quarter of  the company determined that the remaining l and aircraft  together with related rotable parts and inventory  were impaired in accordance with fas because the company continues to utilize these assets  they are classified as held for use under fas  and are recorded on the balance sheet at their estimated fair value at the time of impairment  which is the new asset basis to be depreciated over the assets estimated remaining useful lives 
due primarily to the reduced cost basis of the remaining aircraft  and the retirement of three aircraft  the company recorded million less engine and airframe overhaul amortization expense for the l and fleet in than in in march  the company entered into an agreement to transfer its entire fleet of boeing aircraft to bata by may as a result  in the first quarter of  the company implemented a change in accounting estimate to adjust the estimated useful lives and salvage value of these aircraft to the terms of the bata agreement 
this change in accounting estimate resulted in an increase of depreciation expense of million in  as compared to immediately following the terrorist attacks of september   the company decided to retire its boeing fleet from revenue service  although some aircraft were used for charter service through the first half of these aircraft were determined to be impaired under fas boeing aircraft not already transferred to bata have been classified in the accompanying balance sheets as assets held for sale 
in accordance with fas  depreciation expense was not recorded after the fleet was deemed impaired and will not be recorded in future accounting periods 
as a result  the company did not record any depreciation expense on the boeing fleet in the last four months of  which resulted in a million decrease in depreciation expense in  as compared to amortization of capitalized engine and airframe overhauls on the boeing and lockheed l fleets increased million in  as compared to  after including amortization of related manufacturers credits 
this increase is primarily due to amortization of engine overhauls on the lockheed l and boeing aircraft 
both fleets are relatively new to the company and neither required overhauls until late crew and other employee travel 
the cost of crew and other employee travel decreased to million in as compared to million in the decrease in crew and employee travel in  as compared in  was mainly due to a significant decrease in crew positioning expense 
the average cost of crew positioning per full time equivalent crew member deceased in  as compared to the decrease was primarily due to the decrease in military and charter flights 
for those positioning events which did occur  the company was also able to obtain lower prices from other air carriers through specifically negotiated agreements  as well as benefiting from lower airfares which became generally available in the second half of crew and other employee travel also declined due to a decrease in hotel expenses  also resulting primarily from the decline in international flying 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs 
aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in the decline in maintenance  materials and repairs expense was primarily attributable to a decrease in materials consumed and components repaired related to maintenance on the company s aging fleets of lockheed l and boeing aircraft 
during  the company placed boeing aircraft into bata and retired three lockheed l aircraft from service before related heavy airframe maintenance checks were due to be performed 
the company also recorded a decrease of million in maintenance  materials and repairs in  as compared to  due to a negotiated elimination of return condition requirements on one leased lockheed l aircraft and the recognition of a return condition receivable on one leased boeing aircraft 
the company accrues estimated costs and credits associated with maintenance return conditions for aircraft on leases as a component of maintenance  materials and repairs expense 
the company recognized an increase in aircraft maintenance  materials and repairs of million in  as compared to  relating to the saab b aircraft operated by chicago express 
other selling expenses 
other selling expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in approximately million of this increase in resulted from an increase in crs fees 
this increase resulted partially from the growth in single seat sales volumes between periods and partially because of increases in rates charged by crs systems for improved booking functionality 
credit card discount expense increased million as compared to  primarily due to higher volumes of scheduled service tickets sold using credit cards as form of payment 
advertising 
advertising expense increased to million in  as compared to million in in  the company increased its advertising introducing a new marketing campaign primarily in chicago in connection with the arrival of the new boeing and aircraft  the opening of new ticketing and baggage claim facilities at chicago midway airport  the announcement of new scheduled service destinations  and the promotion of low fares as compared to the competition 
the company also incurred million of incremental advertising costs in associated with rebuilding customer demand after the september terrorist attacks  but due to their unusual nature  these expenses were included as special charges on the income statement 
passenger service 
for and  catering represented and  respectively  of total passenger service expense 
the total cost of passenger service decreased to million in  as compared to million in the company experienced a decrease of approximately in the average unit cost of catering each passenger between and  primarily because in there were fewer military and commercial charter passengers in the company s business mix  which are provided a more expensive catering product due to the longer stage length of these flights 
this resulted in a price and business mix decrease of million in catering expense in  as compared to total jet passengers boarded increased between years  resulting in approximately million in higher volume related catering expenses between the same sets of comparative periods 
in  as compared to  the company incurred approximately million in higher expenses for mishandled baggage and passenger inconvenience due to flight delays and cancellations 
insurance expense 
the total cost of insurance increased to million in  as compared to million in the company experienced increases in liability insurance and hull insurance between years  mainly due to the increase in scheduled service traffic and the addition of the new boeing and boeing fleets beginning in may the company also experienced increases in miscellanous general insurance policies between years 
ground package cost 
ground package cost decreased to million in  as compared to million in ground package costs vary based on the mix of vacation destinations served  the quality and types of ground accommodations offered  and general competitive conditions in the company s markets  all of which factors can change from period to period 
this decline was more significant than the decline in ground package revenue in as compared to  because the company received discounted hotel pricing in the last half of the year due to the weakening economy and the reduction in travel demand after the september attacks 
commissions 
commissions expense decreased to million in  as compared to million in approximately million of the decrease in commissions in  as compared to  was attributable to lower military commissions  which is consistent with the decrease in military revenue between the same time periods 
the company also experienced a decrease of million between and in commissions paid to travel agents by atalc  which is consistent with the decrease in related revenues for that affiliate 
these decreases were partially offset by increases in scheduled service commissions of million between and due to an increase in scheduled service sales made by travel agents 
facilities and other rentals 
the cost of facilities and other rentals increased to million in  as compared to million in growth in facilities costs between periods was primarily attributable to the need to provide maintenance  flight crew and passenger service facilities at airport locations to support new scheduled service destinations and higher frequencies to existing destinations 
the company also began occupancy of significantly expanded and improved passenger check in and baggage claim facilities at chicago midway airport beginning in march aircraft impairments and retirements 
following the events of september   the company decided to retire its boeing fleet earlier than originally planned 
most of the aircraft were retired from revenue service in the fourth quarter of  although some continued to be used for charter service through the first half of in accordance with fas  the company determined that the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the boeing s was less than the net book value of these aircraft and the related rotable parts and inventory 
therefore  these assets were impaired under fas in  the company recorded an asset impairment charge on these assets of million 
also  in the fourth quarter of  the company determined that  in accordance with fas  the estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by the lockheed l and fleet was less than the current net book value of these aircraft and the related rotable parts and inventory 
therefore  the assets were impaired under fas the company recorded an asset impairment charge on these assets of million in us government grant 
as a result of the approval of its initial applications by the dot  the company received cash payments of million in the third quarter of  and million in the fourth quarter of the company recorded total us government grant revenues of million in the second half of relating to its estimates of direct and incremental losses it incurred during that time period  recording a current receivable of million for the balance of cash expected to be paid in other operating expenses 
other operating expenses increased to million in  as compared to million in the purchase by atalc of charter air services from airlines other than the company was million higher in than in flight simulator rentals increased million between years due to the crew training required to introduce the new aircraft 
these increases were partially offset by net decreases in other expenses included in this category  none of which was individually significant 
interest income and expense 
interest expense in decreased to million  as compared to million in the company capitalized additional interest totaling million in  as compared to  on aircraft pre delivery deposits 
additional interest expense of million  all of which was capitalized  was incurred in  as compared to  for incremental borrowings made to fund a portion of aircraft pre delivery deposits 
the company also incurred approximately million in interest expense in  relating to three boeing aircraft which were temporarily financed with bridge debt immediately after the september  terrorist attacks 
these aircraft were refinanced with operating leases at the end of the company invested excess cash balances primarily in commercial paper and money market funds and thereby earned million in interest income in  as compared to million in the decrease in interest income between periods is mainly due to a decline in the average interest rate earned between periods on these investments 
income tax expense 
in  the company recorded million in income tax credits applicable to million of pre tax loss for that period  while in the company recorded million in income tax credits applicable to million of pre tax loss 
the effective tax rate applicable to credits in was  as compared to an effective tax rate of in income tax credits in both periods were affected by the permanent non deductibility for federal income tax purposes of of certain amounts paid for crew per diem 
the value of these permanent differences was not significantly different in as compared to  so they impacted taxable loss more significantly 
liquidity and capital resources cash flows 
in  net cash used in operating activities was million  as compared to net cash provided by operating activities in and of million and million  respectively 
the change in cash provided by or used in operating activities between and primarily resulted from a decrease in earnings  a decrease in the non cash impact of impairment losses recognized on the boeing and lockheed l and fleets  and lower depreciation and amortization expense due to those retirements and impairments 
the change was also impacted by changes in operating assets and liabilities  most significantly an increase in a credit card holdback receivable implemented in late  and a decrease in accrued expenses resulting primarily from the decrease in the deferred payment of certain federal and state taxes authorized in the wake of the terrorist attacks  and the reduction of deferred interest payable on pre delivery deposits in conjunction with the significant number of aircraft deliveries in these changes were partially offset by a decrease in the us government grant receivable 
net cash provided by investing activities was million in  while net cash used in investing activities was million and million  respectively  in the years ended december  and in  million in aircraft pre delivery deposits were returned to the company  net of additional deposits made  in conjunction with aircraft deliveries  while in and  million and million  respectively of expenditures were made for pre delivery deposits on future deliveries of new aircraft  net of returned deposits on delivered aircraft 
changes in cash provided by or used in investing activities were also impacted by capital expenditures 
capital expenditures totaling million  million and million  respectively  were made in  and primarily for aircraft purchases  engine and airframe overhauls  airframe improvements  and the purchase of rotable parts 
the declining trend in capital expenditures is due primarily to the replacement of older aircraft with newer fleets  in which all the aircraft are being leased under operating leases 
the company s maintenance cost per hour agreements  whereby payments are charged to maintenance expense as flight hours are incurred  have and are expected to continue to reduce capital spending on related engine overhauls 
net cash used in financing activities was million in  while net cash provided by financing activities was million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in all years  cash used in or provided by financing activities relates primarily to proceeds from and repayments of short term and long term debt 
in  the company repaid million in pre delivery deposit financings upon delivery of aircraft  net of new borrowings used to fund new deposits 
also in  the company borrowed and repaid million in temporary financing related to the purchase of certain boeing and boeing aircraft  which were subsequently financed through operating leases 
in addition  in  the company obtained a federally guaranteed loan for million  of which million in proceeds were used to fully repay remaining borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
in  the company obtained million in proceeds related to the financing of pre delivery deposits on aircraft  borrowed million under the its bank credit facility  and repaid million in special facility revenue bonds 
also in  the company borrowed and repaid million in temporary debt related to the purchase of certain boeing aircraft  which were subsequently financed with operating leases in late in  net proceeds from short term and long term debt primarily consisted of million from the financing of pre delivery deposits on aircraft and proceeds of million in notes collateralized by two l aircraft 
the company presently expects that cash on hand at december   together with cash generated by future operations and the return of pre delivery cash deposits held by the manufacturers on future aircraft and engine deliveries  will be sufficient to fund the company s obligations during the adverse impact of current airline industry conditions on the company  and the ongoing sufficiency of its financial resources to absorb that impact  will depend upon a number of factors  including but not limited to the company s ability to continue to reduce its operating costs and conserve its financial resources  the pace and extent of seat capacity reductions in the industry  if any  as these may affect competitive pricing for the company s services  the resolution of the current war in the middle east  changes in  if any  the company s current credit card holdback levels  the number of crew members who may be called for duty in the united states armed forces  and the resulting impact on the company s ability to operate as planned  any further declines in the values of the aircraft in the company s fleet  and any aircraft or other asset impairment charges  the increasing price of jet fuel consumed by the company  and the company s ability to retain its management and other employees in light of current industry conditions 
debt and operating lease cash payment obligations 
the company is required to make cash payments in the future on debt obligations and operating leases 
although the company is obligated on a number of long term operating leases which are not recorded on the balance sheet under gaap  the company has no off balance sheet debt and  with the exception of insignificant amounts not requiring disclosure under gaap  does not guarantee the debt of any other party

as of december   the company had taken delivery of boeing s and boeing s obtained directly from boeing 
all remaining aircraft to be purchased directly from boeing are scheduled for delivery between july and december aircraft pre delivery deposits are required for these purchases  and the company has funded these deposits using operating cash and primarily short term deposit finance facilities 
as of december   the company had million in pre delivery deposits outstanding for these aircraft  of which million was provided by a deposit finance facility with rolls royce 
upon delivery of the aircraft  pre delivery deposits funded with operating cash will be returned to the company  and those funded with a deposit facility will be used to repay that facility 
in december  the company entered into an agreement to exercise purchase rights on two boeing aircraft to be delivered in may and june the company currently has purchase rights remaining for eight boeing aircraft and boeing aircraft 
the company had operating lease agreements in place to lease new boeing s from ilfc 
as of december   the company had taken delivery of boeing s that are being leased from ilfc 
the remaining aircraft under these operating lease agreements are currently scheduled for delivery in june and november the company had an agreement to acquire five additional new boeing s to be financed by operating leases with ge capital aviation services gecas 
the company took delivery of the fifth boeing aircraft being leased from gecas in the third quarter of although the company typically finances aircraft with long term operating leases  it has a bridge financing facility which provides for maximum borrowings of million to finance new boeing aircraft and new boeing aircraft 
borrowings under the facility bear interest  at the option of ata  at libor plus a margin  which depends on the percentage of the purchase price borrowed and whether the borrowing matures or months after the aircraft delivery date 
during the first four months of  the company borrowed million  under this bridge facility  for the purchase of certain boeing and boeing aircraft 
as of june   these borrowings were repaid in full  while the related aircraft were financed under long term operating leases 
the company has an agreement with general electric to purchase four spare engines  which are scheduled for delivery between and the company has acquired two spare rolls royce engines  one of which was delivered in  and the other in june in may  the company entered into an agreement with amr leasing corporation to lease six saab b aircraft  with options to lease up to additional aircraft 
as of september   the company had taken delivery of all six saab b aircraft under this agreement 
in march  the company entered into a limited liability company agreement with bcc to form bata  a joint venture 
because the company does not control bata  the company s investment is being accounted for under the equity method of accounting 
bata is expected to remarket the company s fleet of boeing aircraft in either passenger or cargo configurations 
in exchange for supplying the aircraft and certain operating services to bata  the company has and will continue to receive both cash and equity in the income or loss of bata 
as of december   the company has transferred of its original fleet of boeing aircraft to bata 
significant financings 
on november   the company obtained a million secured term loan  of which million was guaranteed by the air transportation stabilization board 
the net proceeds of the secured term loan were approximately million  after deducting issuance costs 
the company used a portion of the net proceeds to repay borrowings on its existing bank credit facility and to collateralize new letters of credit  previously secured under the bank facility 
the remaining funds will be used for general corporate purposes 
interest is payable monthly at libor plus a margin 
guarantee fees of of the outstanding guaranteed principal balance in  with escalation to on the outstanding guaranteed principal balance in through  are payable quarterly 
the secured term loan is subject to certain restrictive covenants and is collateralized primarily by certain receivables  certain aircraft  spare engines  and rotables 
the receivables had a carrying amount of approximately million as of december  the aircraft  spare engines and parts consist of three lockheed l aircraft  nine lockheed l and aircraft  two saab b aircraft  rolls royce rb spare engines and boeing  boeing and boeing rotables  which held a combined carrying amount of approximately million as of december  in conjunction with obtaining the secured term loan  the company issued a warrant to the federal government to purchase up to million shares of its common stock  and additional warrants to purchase up to million shares of its common stock to other loan participants  in each case at an exercise price of per share for a term of ten years 
the company has recorded million as the total fair value of warrants issued  which is also recorded as unamortized discount on the secured term loan as of december  prior to obtaining the secured term loan  the company had a secured revolving bank credit facility which provided for maximum borrowings of million  including up to million for stand by letters of credit 
borrowings under the facility were subject to an interest rate  at the option of the company  at either libor plus a margin or the agent bank s prime rate

upon repayment of the borrowings and letters of credit  the revolving bank credit facility was terminated  and all assets previously pledged as collateral were released 
card agreement 
the company accepts charges to most major credit and debit cards cards as payment from its customers 
approximately of scheduled service sales are purchased using these cards 
more than half of these card sales are made using mastercard or visa cards 
the company maintains an agreement with a bank for the processing and collection of charges to these cards 
under this agreement a sale is normally charged to the purchaser s card account and is paid to the company in cash within a few days of the date of purchase  although the company may provide the purchased services days  weeks or months later 
in  the company processed approximately million in mastercard and visa charges under its merchant processing agreement 
on september   the bank notified the company that it had determined that the terrorist attacks of september   the ensuing grounding of commercial flights by the faa  and the significant uncertainty about the level of future air travel entitled the bank to retain cash collected by it on processed card charges as a deposit  up to of the full dollar amount of purchased services to be provided at a future date
