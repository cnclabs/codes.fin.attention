general stac  inc stac incorporated hifn as a wholly owned subsidiary on august  on november   stac transferred its semiconductor business  along with the associated technology  assets and liabilities  to hifn in exchange for  shares of hifn series a preferred stock and shares of hifn common stock pursuant to a stock purchase agreement 
on march   the company completed its initial public offering when it was spun off from stac  inc the initial public offering raised approximately million  net of offering expenses  followed by an additional million when the company s underwriters exercised their option to purchase additional shares of hifn s common stock on april  industry background the need for a more effective use of and efficient communication utilizing the public network infrastructure in a business environment is one of the main drivers of the extensive deployment of network based communications systems 
the resulting increase in connectivity has further driven the need for technology that safeguards and manages the access to information available over these expanding global networks 
the network computing market has undergone three major transitions over the past decade and it is the convergence of these transitions that contributed to the recent increase in global connectivity 
the first of these transitions was the migration of corporate computing environments from centralized mainframe systems to distributed client server environments 
the ability to access and share information through client server technology expanded the need for connectivity beyond workgroup local area networks lans to enterprise wide networks spanning multiple lans and wide area networks wans 
the second major transition was the widespread adoption of the internet for business to business communications 
internet based business applications have expanded beyond e mail to a broad range of business applications and services including electronic publishing  direct to customer transactions  product marketing  advertising and customer support 
the last of these transitions was the emergence of consumer to business or e commerce communications 
the convergence of these major transitions led to the need for secure  managed communications and the emergence of virtual private networks that use the public internet infrastructure and associated protocols and applications to share information and services  both within the enterprise and with business partners and customers 
as a result  businesses are able to share internal information and run enterprise applications across geographically dispersed facilities as well as enable customers  suppliers and other business partners to inexpensively link into their enterprise information systems 
as internet protocols and infrastructure gain increasing and widespread acceptance for global communication  new wide area connectivity services such as database access  transaction processing services  audio and telephone services  as well as video teleconferencing services  are emerging at a rapid rate 
this expansion of services and applications is further accelerating the use of networks as global communication systems 
the emergence of e business increased the challenges in enabling secure access to information and applications 
the complexity of and need for network security driven to provide the tremendous benefits of connectivity and information exchange  organizations potentially expose sensitive information and mission critical applications to unauthorized access  both through 
table of contents connections to the public internet and from within the enterprise 
in addition  transmission of data over the internet may also expose such data to unauthorized interception 
these risks create a critical need for enterprises to protect their information and information systems from unauthorized access and use 
historical methods for securing information resources are no longer adequate to meet the security requirements of today s global networks 
today s distributed network environments provide multiple points of access and multiple network resources  making it impractical to individually secure every application and resource on the network 
therefore  additional layers of security at the network level are required to control access to the network and to regulate and protect the flow of data between network segments 
the increasing demands placed on data communication security systems by the expansion of internet services and global enterprise networking is quickly outpacing the capabilities of many traditional internet security appliance architectures 
these demands include the need to define and transparently enforce an integrated  enterprise wide security policy that can be managed centrally and implemented on a distributed basis 
an effective network security solution also needs to be open and extensible to enable it to address the rapidly changing requirements of the internet and intranets  including the addition of new security applications  such as authentication  encryption  url filtering  anti virus protection  and java and activex security services and functions 
this increased complexity  along with the higher demand placed by ever increasing bandwidths and the increasing number of users has driven the creation of data communications semiconductors specifically designed for the security task 
these high performance security integrated circuits create the next generation security platform for the internet based on a combination of protocol features  customer complex core logic and standards based buses and interfaces 
this is at the core of hifn s security network processor products 
the hifn solution hifn is a flow classification and network security specialist company supplying most major network equipment vendors with patented technology to improve network packet processing 
we design  develop and market high performance  multi protocol packet processors semiconductor devices and software designed to enable secure  high bandwidth network connectivity  comprehensive differentiation of business critical application network traffic from other general purpose network traffic and efficient compression  encryption compression and public key cryptography  providing our customers with high performance  interoperable implementations of a wide variety of industry standard networking and storage protocols 
we believe that our patented compression technology comprises the fundamental know how for the design and implementation of low cost  high performance implementations of lossless data compression and gives our products a strong competitive advantage 
by offering a wide range of high performance implementations of our patented  standards compliant technology  we are able to sell products to network and storage equipment vendors that allow them to reduce development costs and get their products to market faster 
our patented lempel ziv stac compression technology lzs is incorporated into several networking protocol standards  including point to point protocol ppp and the frame relay protocol  allowing network equipment vendors to rapidly integrate proven solutions for mitigating the costs associated with traditional private leased line network architectures 
the microsoft point to point compression mppc implementation of our patents  developed by microsoft  is incorporated into the ppp and point to point tunneling protocol pptp implementations of the windows   me  nt  and xp operating systems 
we offer high performance compression processors that implement lzs and mppc 
we also license software implementations of lzs and mppc to industry leading network equipment vendors for use in their networking products 
in support of emerging virtual private network vpn architectures  we have led the industry by introducing the first network security processors  integrating the critical functions of compression  encryption and data authentication in compliance with the internet protocol security ipsec  secure session layer ssl and transport layer security tls protocols 
this integration allows network equipment vendors to add highly integrated  high performance vpn capabilities to their routers  remote access concentrators  switches  broadband access equipment and firewalls 

table of contents businesses are increasingly dependent upon the public internet in conducting their normal business operations 
unlike the traditional telecommunications network used by businesses to communicate  the public internet is vastly more complex and unreliable 
in addition  there is currently an overall lack of differentiation or prioritization of business critical functions from general use of the internet 
rather  these functions are bundled together and use the same resources throughout the public internet 
our flow classification solutions enable the integration of precise differentiation and measurement of business critical transactions within network equipment vendors devices 
this feature allows the creation of differentiated services within the public internet 
hifn s line of compression processors targeted at back up storage applications provides storage equipment vendors high performance implementations of our patented compression technology  doubling the capacity and performance of mid to high end tape drive systems 
the lzs implementation of our patents is used in the digital linear tape dlt drive products from quantum 
the adaptive lossless data compression aldc implementation of our patents  developed by ibm  is used in a variety of tape storage products  including the linear tape open lto drives and travan style of quarter inch cartridge tape drives 
customers and products a number of leading manufacturers of network and storage equipment have designed products that incorporate our products 
to date  we have secured numerous design wins with networking and storage equipment vendors 
to qualify as a design win  an equipment vendor must have ordered samples of our packet processors or an evaluation board and initiated a product design that incorporates our solutions 
during the design in process  we work with each customer  providing training on our products  assisting in resolving technical questions and providing price and delivery information to assist the customer in getting our products into volume production 
we cannot assure that any of the design wins we have secured will result in demand for our products 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends  risks and uncertainties our business depends upon the development of the packet processor market and we face risks associated with evolving industry standards and rapid technological change 
at september   we had a backlog of semiconductor orders representing million of products deliverable to customers over the months following the placement of these orders 
at september   we had a backlog of million 
because we quote product lead times to customers of approximately three months  most products shipped during a quarter are ordered during the previous quarter 
since customers may reschedule or cancel orders  subject to negotiated windows  orders scheduled for shipment in a quarter may be moved to a subsequent quarter or cancelled altogether 
therefore  backlog is not necessarily indicative of future sales

storage enhancement products 
hifn s  and high performance compression processors provide a typical doubling of capacity and performance for mid to high end tape drive products 
evaluation boards 
to facilitate the adoption of our semiconductor devices  we design system level boards that resemble actual end products or subsystems 
our evaluation boards include basic hardware and software that enable customers to expedite their designs by using the evaluation boards as a reference or by incorporating portions of them into their own designs 
these boards are used as evaluation and development vehicles for each semiconductor device designed by hifn 
technology hifn s multi protocol packet processors  which are high performance compression  encryption compression and public key processors  and our flow classification software have been designed to meet the needs of networking and storage equipment vendors 
we believe that our patented compression technology  employed in our compression and encryption compression processors  gives us a strong competitive advantage 
in addition to core technologies that we have developed  we enhance the features and functionality of our products through the licensing of certain technologies from third parties 
compression algorithms and architectures 
hifn holds key patents that cover a wide variety of lossless compression algorithms and their implementations 
specific implementations of our compression patents include the following compression algorithms lzs  developed by stac  mppc  developed by microsoft  and aldc  developed by ibm 
we have continued to improve the performance  functionality and architectures of these compression techniques

hifn is continuing to develop additional packet processing functionality  including integration of computation intensive security protocol processing functions  and integration of the meterflow classification capabilities 
ongoing product and technology development is expected to increase product integration and increase product performance in the future 
intellectual property our future success and ability to compete are dependent  in part  upon our proprietary technology 
we rely in part on patent  trade secret  trademark  maskwork and copyright laws to protect our intellectual property 
we own eighteen united states patents and seven foreign patents 
we also have two pending patent applications in japan 
the issued patents and patent applications primarily cover various aspects of our compression  flow classification  bandwidth management and rate shaping technologies and have expiration dates ranging from to we also have five pending patent applications in the united states  four in europe and asia japan covering our flow classification technology 
we cannot assure that any patents will be issued under our current or future patent applications or that the patents issued under such patent applications will not be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
we cannot assure that any patents issued to us will be adequate to safeguard and maintain our proprietary rights  to deter misappropriation or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying our technology  designing around the patents we own or otherwise obtaining and using our products  designs or other information 
in addition  we cannot assure that others will not develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
as is typical in the semiconductor industry  we may in the future receive communications from third parties asserting patents  mask work rights  intellectual property or copyrights on certain of our products and technologies 
although we are not currently a party to any material litigation regarding intellectual property  in the event a third party were to make a valid intellectual property claim and a license relating to such intellectual property was not available on commercially reasonable terms  our operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
litigation  which could result in substantial cost to us and diversion of our resources  may also be necessary to enforce our patents or other intellectual property rights or to defend 
table of contents against claimed infringement of the rights of others 
the failure to obtain necessary licenses or the occurrence of litigation relating to patent infringement or other intellectual property matters could have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results 
we cannot assure that the steps we take to protect our intellectual property will be adequate to prevent misappropriation or that others will not develop competitive technologies or products 
in addition  we claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers  suppliers  employees and consultants  and through other security measures 
although we intend to protect our rights vigorously  we cannot assure that these measures will be successful 
furthermore  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property 
export restrictions on encryption algorithms a key element of hifn s packet processor architecture is the encryption algorithms embedded in our semiconductor and software products 
these products are subject to export control regulations administered by the us department of commerce 
the regulations permit our domestic network equipment customers to export non military specific products incorporating our encryption technology only after the finished product has received a one time technical review from the department of commerce 
in addition  those us export control laws prohibit the export of many products  including any products with encryption  to a number of countries deemed hostile by the us government currently there are nine such countries 
furthermore  us government regulations require export licenses from the department of state for all military specific products 
the sale of our packet processors could be hindered or harmed by the failure of our network equipment customers to obtain the required technical reviews or by the costs of compliance 
see sales  marketing technical support 
competition the networking and storage equipment markets into which we sell our products are intensely competitive and are subject to frequent product introductions with improved price performance characteristics  rapid technological change  unit price erosion and the continued emergence of new industry standards 
the semiconductor industry is also intensely competitive and is characterized by rapid technological change  product obsolescence and unit price erosion 
we expect competition to increase in the future from existing competitors and from companies that may enter our existing or future markets  including certain customers  with similar or substitute solutions that may be less costly or provide better performance or features than our products 
to be successful in the future  we must continue to respond promptly and effectively to changing customer performance  feature and pricing requirements  technological change and competitors innovations 
we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our products compete with products from companies such as safenet  inc  ibm  broadcom corporation  motorola  inc 
and cavium networks 
in  stac entered into two license agreements with ibm where stac granted ibm the right to use  but not sublicense  our patented compression technology in ibm hardware and software products 
stac also entered into a license agreement with microsoft in whereby stac granted microsoft the right to use  but not sublicense  our compression technology in their software products 
stac s license agreement with microsoft  however  prohibits microsoft from creating hardware implementations of our patents 
we also compete against software solutions that use general purpose microprocessors to run encryption algorithms and our software compression libraries 
in addition  as noted above  our encryption compression and public key processors are subject to export control restrictions administered by the us department of commerce  which permit our network equipment customers to export products incorporating encryption technology only after receiving a one time technical review 
as a result of these regulations  sales by foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their encryption products could hinder or harm the sale of our encryption compression and public key processors to network equipment customers in the global 
table of contents market 
however  we expect significant future competition from major domestic and international semiconductor suppliers 
several established electronics and semiconductor suppliers have recently entered or indicated an intent to enter the network equipment market 
we may also face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
furthermore  many of our existing and potential customers internally develop application specific integrated circuits  general purpose microprocessors and other devices that attempt to perform all or a portion of the functions performed by our products 
many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater name recognition  access to larger customer bases and significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources than us 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the promotion and sale of their products than us 
in particular  companies such as intel corporation  agere systems  motorola  inc  national semiconductor corporation and texas instruments incorporated have proprietary semiconductor manufacturing ability  preferred vendor status with many of our customers  extensive marketing power and name recognition  greater financial resources than us and other significant advantages over us 
in addition  current and potential competitors may determine  for strategic reasons  to consolidate  to lower the price of their products substantially or to bundle their products with other products 
current and potential competitors have established or may establish financial or strategic relationships among themselves or with existing or potential customers  resellers or other third parties 
accordingly  it is possible that new competitors or alliances among competitors could emerge and rapidly acquire significant market share 
we cannot assure that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors 
increased competition may result in price reductions  reduced gross margins and loss of market share  any of which could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we believe that important competitive factors in our markets are price performance characteristics  rapid technological change  the continued emergence of new industry standards  length of development cycles  design wins with major network and storage equipment vendors  support for new network and storage standards  features and functionality  adaptability of products to specific applications  reliability  technical service and support and protection of products by effective utilization of intellectual property laws 
our failure to successfully develop products that compete successfully with those of other suppliers in the market would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  we must compete for the services of qualified distributors and sales representatives 
to the extent that our competitors offer such distributors or sales representatives more favorable terms on a higher volume of business  such distributors or sales representatives may decline to carry  or discontinue carrying  our products 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any failure to maintain and expand our distribution network 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends  risks and uncertainties our markets are highly competitive 
research and development our success will depend to a substantial degree upon our ability to develop and introduce in a timely fashion new products and enhancements to our existing products that meet changing customer requirements and emerging industry standards 
we have made  and plan to continue to make  substantial investments in research and development 
extensive product development input is obtained from customers and through our participation in industry organizations and standards setting bodies such as the internet engineering task force ietf and the storage network industry association snia 
as of september   our research and development staff consisted of employees 
our research and development expenditures were million in the fiscal year ended september   million in the fiscal year ended september  and million in the fiscal year ended september   representing  and of net revenues for such periods  respectively 
research and development expenses primarily consist of salaries and related costs of employees engaged in ongoing research  design and development activities  costs of fabricating chip mask sets and subcontracting costs 
we perform our research and product development activities at our facilities in los gatos and carlsbad  california  as well as in framingham  massachusetts and morrisville  north carolina 

table of contents the acquisition of certain assets of netoctave in september and of apptitude in august further strengthened our development efforts  adding to our pool of hardware and software expertise and intellectual properties 
furthermore  we were able to expand our product base to include storage area network  high performance ipsec  acceleration for firewall applications  bandwidth management  load balancing  qos and cos 
our future performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to identify emerging technological trends in our target markets  develop and maintain competitive products  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of our competitors  bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices  properly identify target markets and respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
in evaluating new product decisions  we must anticipate well in advance the future demand for product features and performance characteristics  as well as available supporting technologies  manufacturing capacity  industry standards and competitive product offerings 
we cannot assure that our design and introduction schedules for any additions and enhancements to our existing and future products will be able to be sold at prices that are favorable to us 
we must also continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue enhancing the performance and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and customer demands for improved performance  features and functionality 
the technical innovations required for us to remain competitive are inherently complex and require long development cycles 
such innovations must be completed before developments in networking technologies or standards render them obsolete and must be sufficiently compelling to induce network and storage equipment vendors to favor them over alternative technologies 
moreover  we must generally incur substantial research and development costs before the technical feasibility and commercial viability of a product line can be ascertained 
we cannot assure that revenues from future products or product enhancements will be sufficient to recover the development costs associated with such products or enhancements or that we will be able to secure the financial resources necessary to fund future development 
the failure to successfully develop new products on a timely basis could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations trends  risks and uncertainties we face risks associated with evolving industry standards and rapid technological change 
sales  marketing technical support we market our products through a direct sales and marketing organization  headquartered in los gatos  california  with sales offices in massachusetts  colorado and north carolina as well as in the united kingdom and the netherlands 
we also market our products through independent contract sales representatives in the united states  europe  japan and other areas 
furthermore  we retain account managers to focus on individual customer relationships 
our customers in foreign countries are serviced through international distributors 
sales representatives are selected for their understanding of the marketplace and their ability to provide effective field sales support for our products 
our relationships with some of our sales representatives have been established within the last two years  and we are unable to predict the extent to which some of these representatives will be successful in marketing and selling our products 
revenues from quantum corporation  through its manufacturing subcontractor  represented  and of our net revenues for fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
revenues from cisco  through its manufacturing subcontractors  represented of our net revenues for fiscal year ended september  and revenues from lucent  through its manufacturing subcontractors  represented of our net revenues for fiscal year ended september  our customers are not subject to any binding obligation to order from us 
if our sales to quantum or cisco decline  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our most significant customers in the future could be different from our largest customers today for a number of reasons  including customers deployment schedules and budget considerations 
as a result  we may experience significant fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and an annual basis 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition 
table of contents and results of operations trends  risks and uncertainties we depend upon a small number of customers 
hifn has a number of marketing programs designed to inform network and storage equipment vendors about the capabilities and benefits of our products 
our marketing efforts include participation in industry trade shows  technical conferences  preparation of competitive analyses  sales training  publication of technical and educational articles in industry journals  maintenance of our website  advertising and direct mail distribution of our literature 
technical support to customers is provided through field applications engineers and  if necessary  applications engineers and product designers 
local field support is provided in person or by telephone 
we believe that providing customers with comprehensive product service and support is critical to maintaining a competitive position in the market and is critical to shortening the time required to design in our products 
we work with our customers to monitor the performance of our product designs and to provide support at each stage of customer product development 
the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
the industry has also experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
this has caused significant variances in product demand  production capacity and rapid erosion of average selling prices 
industry wide fluctuations in the future could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
manufacturing currently  we subcontract all semiconductor manufacturing on a turnkey basis  with our suppliers delivering fully assembled and tested products based on our proprietary designs 
the use of the fabless model allows us to focus substantially all of our resources on determining customer requirements and on the design  development and support of our products 
this model also allows us to have significantly reduced capital requirements 
we subcontract our semiconductor manufacturing to atmel corporation  toshiba corporation and philips semiconductor 
the selection of these manufacturers was based on the breadth of available technology  quality  manufacturing capacity and support for design tools used by us 
none of our products are currently manufactured by more than one supplier 
however  we expect that in the event one of our suppliers notifies us that it intends to cease manufacturing a product  we will have an adequate opportunity to order sufficient quantities of the affected products so that shipments to customers will not be adversely affected while we qualify a new manufacturer 
at any given time  we use mainstream processes for the manufacture of our products  avoiding dependence on the latest process technology available 
this approach reduces our technical risks and avoids the risks related to production capacity constraints typically associated with leading edge semiconductor processes 
this approach allows us to focus on providing differentiated functionality  the primary value add in our products 
our current main products are manufactured using     
and 
micron complementary metal oxide semiconductor cmos processes 
products under development are being designed with the 
micron cmos process 
we believe that transitioning our products to increasingly smaller semiconductor dimensions will be important for us to remain competitive 
we cannot assure that future process migration will be achieved without difficulty 
we intend to continue for the foreseeable future to rely on our subcontract manufacturers for substantially all of our manufacturing  assembly and test requirements 
all of our subcontract manufacturers produce products for other companies 
we do not have long term manufacturing agreements with any of our subcontract manufacturers 
our subcontract manufacturers are not obligated to supply products to us for any specific period  in any specific quantity or at any specific price  except as may be provided in a particular purchase order that has been accepted by one of our subcontract manufacturers 
we must place orders approximately to weeks in advance of expected delivery 
as a result  we have only a limited ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  which could cause us to have an 
table of contents excess or a shortage of inventory of a particular product 
failure of worldwide semiconductor manufacturing capacity to rise along with a rise in demand could result in our subcontract manufacturers allocating available capacity to customers that are larger or have long term supply contracts in place 
our inability to obtain adequate foundry capacity at acceptable prices  or any delay or interruption in supply  could reduce our product revenue or increase our cost of revenue and could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations

revenues from one customer  through its manufacturing subcontractor  represented  and of our net revenues for fiscal years ended september   and  respectively 
revenues from a second customer  through its manufacturing subcontractors  represented of our net revenues for fiscal year ended september  in september  hifn acquired certain assets and intellectual property valued at  for cash consideration of approximately million  including acquisition related costs 
assets acquired include fixed assets  core technology and workforce comprising of engineers that joined us on october  additionally  we acquired in process research and development costs of approximately million  which were expensed at the time of the acquisition 
in august  hifn acquired apptitude  a provider of embedded internet traffic analysis solutions through a merger of apptitude with and into a wholly owned subsidiary of hifn 
the aggregate purchase consideration was million  consisting of million in cash and million in stock 
in exchange  we received tangible assets and assumed liabilities as well as intangible assets including developed and core technology  workforce and patents 
additionally  we acquired in process research and development costs which were expensed at the time of the acquisition 

table of contents during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our product plans changed as a result of a shift in customer feature requirements and demand  consequently  long lived and intangible assets associated with terminated projects were impaired and we recorded a charge of million 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that customer preferences with respect to the architecture upon which the apptitude technology would be delivered had shifted 
as a result  we significantly lowered our estimates of expected future revenues and cash flows from the apptitude technology 
the expected future cash flows  undiscounted and without interest charges  was less than the carrying amount of the assets associated with apptitude and an impairment charge was triggered under financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of 
accordingly  we estimated the fair value of the apptitude assets  using the present value of estimated expected future cash flows and a discount rate commensurate with the risks involved 
we recorded an impairment charge of million  representing the amount by which the carrying amount of the goodwill and developed technology exceeded their fair value 
the remaining carrying value of goodwill at september  was approximately million 
we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  during the first quarter of fiscal  which effectively replaces sfas in accordance with sfas  the remaining carrying value of goodwill is not amortized  but is subject to annual impairment testing 
hifn s quarterly and annual operating results are affected by a wide variety of factors that could materially and adversely affect net sales  gross margins and operating income 
these factors include the volume and timing of orders received  changes in the mix of proprietary and second source products sold  market acceptance of our and our customers products  competitive pricing pressures  our ability to introduce new products on a timely basis  the timing and extent of research and development expenses  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  cyclical semiconductor industry conditions  our access to advanced process technologies and the timing and extent of process development costs 
historically in the semiconductor industry  average selling prices of products have decreased over time 
if we are unable to introduce new products with higher margins  maintain our product mix between proprietary and second source products  or reduce manufacturing cost to offset decreases in the prices of our existing products  then our operating results will be adversely affected 
our business is characterized by short term orders and shipment schedules  and customer orders typically can be canceled or rescheduled without penalty to the customer 
since most of our backlog is cancelable without penalty  we typically plan our production and inventory levels based on internal forecasts of customer demand 
customer demand remains highly unpredictable and variances to the forecast can fluctuate substantially 
in addition  because of high fixed costs in the semiconductor industry  we are limited in our ability to reduce costs quickly in response to any revenue shortfalls 
as a result of the foregoing or other factors  we have experienced  and may in the future experience  material adverse fluctuations in our operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which have in the past  and would in the future  materially affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the financial statements are prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america and requires management to make estimates and assumptions in certain circumstances that affect amounts reported in the accompanying consolidated financial statements and related footnotes 
as such  we are required to make certain estimates  judgments and assumptions that we believe are reasonable based upon the information available 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the periods presented 
the significant accounting policies which we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our reported financial results include the following revenue recognition 
we derive our revenue from the sale of processors and software license fees 
customers comprise primarily of original equipment manufacturers oems and  to a lesser extent  distributors 
revenue from the sale of processors is recognized upon shipment when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the price is fixed or determined and collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably 
table of contents assured 
revenue from processors sold to distributors under agreements allowing certain rights of return is deferred until the distributor sells the product to a third party 
software license revenue is generally recognized when a signed agreement or other persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  vendor specific objective evidence exists to allocate a portion of the total fee to any undelivered elements of the arrangement  the software has been shipped or electronically delivered  the license fee is fixed or determinable and collection of the resulting receivables is reasonably assured 
returns  including exchange rights for unsold licenses  are estimated based on historical experience and are deferred until the return rights expire 
we base the levels of returns on historical experience 
to the extent we experience increased levels of returns  revenue will decrease resulting in decreased gross profit 
we receive software license revenue from oems that sublicense our software shipped with their products 
the oem sublicense agreements are generally valid for a term of one year and include rights to unspecified future upgrades and maintenance during the term of the agreement 
license fees under these agreements are recognized ratably over the term of the agreement 
revenues from sublicenses sold in excess of the specified volume in the original license agreement are recognized when they are reported as sold to end customers by the oem 
our deferred revenue balance as of september  was million and included approximately  in exchange rights for unsold licenses 
management judgments and estimates must be made regarding the collectibility of fees charged 
should changes in conditions cause management to determine the collectibility criteria are not met for certain future transactions  revenue recognized for any reporting period could be adversely affected 
inventories 
we value our inventory at the lower of cost determined on a first in  first out cost method or market 
inventories are comprised solely of finished goods  which are manufactured by third party foundries for resale by us 
we provide for obsolete  slow moving or excess inventories  based on forecasts prepared by management  in the period when obsolescence or inventory in excess of expected demand is first identified 
reserves are established to reduce the cost basis of inventory for excess and obsolete inventory 
as of september   inventories of million that were previously written down were still on hand 
subsequent increases in projected demand will not result in a reversal of these reserves until the sale of the related inventory 
we are subject to technological change  new product development  and product obsolescence 
actual demand may differ from forecasted demand and such differences may have a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets and goodwill 
we evaluate the recovery of finite lived intangible assets and other finite long lived assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable through the estimated undiscounted future cash flows resulting from the use of the assets 
if we determine that the carrying value of goodwill  other intangible assets and other long lived assets may not be recoverable  we measure impairment by using the projected discounted cash flow method 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on market conditions and operational performance of our business 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  the company s product plans changed as a result of a shift in customer feature requirements and demand 
consequently  long lived and intangibles assets associated with terminated projects were impaired and a charge of million was recorded 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  prior to the implementation of sfas  we recorded a million charge for impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
the impairment charges were based on the present value of management estimates of future cash flows 
changes in these estimates could have a material impact on the impairment charge and any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
in accordance with sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer be amortized but instead are subject to annual impairment tests or interim impairment tests whenever events or circumstances indicate that their carrying value may not be recoverable 
we adopted sfas no 
during the first quarter of fiscal other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
goodwill amortization expense aggregated million and 
table of contents million during fiscal and  respectively 
after the impairment described above  the carrying value of goodwill was approximately million at september  asset impairment charges could have a material effect on our consolidated financial position and results of operations 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements we are required to estimate our income taxes  which involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
significant management judgment is required to assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
during fiscal  we recognized a tax benefit of million related to carry back of net operating losses to prior years 
during fiscal  we recorded a net tax expense of million to establish a valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
continuing losses in recent reporting periods increase the uncertainties regarding realizability of deferred tax assets 
while we have considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for the valuation allowance  in the event we were to determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period such determination is made 
litigation 
from time to time  we may become involved in litigation relating to claims arising from the ordinary course of business 
management considers such claims on a case by case basis 
we accrue for loss contingencies if both of the following conditions are met a information available prior to the issuance of the financial statements indicates that it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred at the date of the financial statements  and b the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
during fiscal  in relation to the million court approved settlement of the class action suit against us  we recognized million in litigation settlement charges  representing the uninsured portion of the total settlement amount 
subsequently  in september  we settled our obligation through the issuance of  shares of our common stock to the class

table of contents years ended september   and net revenues 
net revenues from sales of semiconductor processors and licenses of software libraries decreased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal the decrease in net revenues in fiscal from fiscal was mainly due to a decrease in license and software revenues of million 
net revenues from sales of semiconductor processors and licenses of software libraries decreased in fiscal to million compared to million in fiscal the decrease in net revenues in fiscal from fiscal was due to a decrease in sales of our data compression and encryption processors to network equipment manufacturers of million as well as a decrease in license and software revenues of million 
semiconductor sales to quantum  an original equipment manufacturer of high performance tape storage devices  through its manufacturing subcontractor  comprised  and of net revenues in each of fiscal  and  respectively 
semiconductor sales to cisco  an original equipment manufacturer  comprised of net revenues in fiscal semiconductor sales to lucent  an original equipment manufacturer of networking equipment  through its manufacturing subcontractors  comprised of net revenues in fiscal cost of revenues 
cost of revenues consists primarily of semiconductor processors which were manufactured to our specifications by third parties for resale by us 
cost of revenues  as a percentage of net revenues  increased to in fiscal from in fiscal cost of revenues  as a percentage of revenues  of in fiscal included a million charge for excess inventory that resulted from a decrease in semiconductor processor demand below our previous expectations 
exclusive of the inventory charge  cost of revenues in fiscal was of net revenues 
during fiscal and  we sold inventories that had previously been written off and recognized net recoveries of  and  respectively 
the fluctuation in cost of revenues is primarily attributable to shifts in the proportion of processors revenues to software revenues 
research and development 
research and development expenses were million  or of net revenues in fiscal  million  or of net revenues  in fiscal and million  or of net revenues  in fiscal research and development expenses increased in fiscal from fiscal and reflect an increase in salaries and benefits of million as a result of an increase in headcount  an increase in nonrecurring engineering charges of million and depreciation of engineering development tools of  offset by a reduction in deferred compensation amortization related to the acquisition of apptitude of million  which includes million in deferred compensation amortization related to the voluntary stock option exchange in fiscal research and development expenses decreased slightly in fiscal from fiscal and reflect an increase in nonrecurring engineering charges of  and the purchase of engineering development tools for new product development of  offset by a reduction in outside service costs for contractors of  and a reduction in compensation and benefits of  generally as a result of the suspension of bonus and profit sharing programs in fiscal research and development expense also includes amortization of deferred stock compensation related to the acquisition of apptitude of  in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal we expect our investments in research and development to continue to increase in coming periods on an absolute basis  excluding the effect of deferred compensation amortization charges  as we continue to develop products targeted at meeting market needs 
we currently have six products in development with anticipated production dates ranging from december through early however  we cannot assure that product development programs invested in by us will be successful or that products resulting from such programs will achieve market acceptance 
sales and marketing 
sales and marketing expenses were million  or of net revenues  in fiscal  million  or of net revenues  in fiscal and million  or of net revenues  in fiscal the decrease in sales and marketing expenses in fiscal from fiscal reflects the net effect of a decrease in salaries and wages expense of  as a result of a decrease in average headcount of eight employees  a decrease in deferred compensation expense of  and decreases in travel  tradeshow and

amortization of intangibles was million  or of net revenues  for fiscal  million  or of net revenues  for fiscal  and million  or of net revenues  for fiscal goodwill amortization expense related to the acquisition of apptitude aggregated million and million in fiscal years and  respectively 
as a result of our adoption of sfas see note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we ceased amortization of goodwill beginning october  impairment of intangibles and goodwill 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  our product plans changed as a result of a shift in customer feature requirements and demand  consequently  long lived and intangible assets associated with terminated projects were impaired and we recorded a charge of million to write down developed and licensed technologies 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that customer preferences with respect to the apptitude technology had shifted  resulting in a significant reduction in expected revenues 
as a result of our evaluation of the carrying value of long lived assets  we recorded an impairment charge of million as a write down of goodwill and developed technology 
the remaining carrying value of goodwill at september  was approximately million  which balance is not amortized but is subject to impairment testing in accordance with sfas see note of notes to consolidated financial statements

the effective tax rates for fiscal was a benefit of and for fiscal and charges of and  respectively 
during fiscal  we recognized a tax benefit of million related to carry back of net operating losses to prior years 
as a result of our continuing losses over a longer period than previously expected  we recorded a valuation allowance of million during the third quarter of fiscal to reduce the carrying value of our deferred tax assets 
we considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the valuation allowance 
we recorded a benefit from income taxes of million in fiscal the resulting effective tax rates are primarily the result of the non deductibility of certain acquisition related costs consisting mainly of the amortization of intangibles and goodwill 
the effective tax rate for fiscal of is below the combined statutory tax rate of due primarily to the fact that there is no tax benefit from the accounting amortization of intangible assets and stock based compensation

we expect capital expenditures in the foreseeable future to approximate fiscal levels 
financing activities 
cash provided by financing activities in fiscal  and of million   and million  respectively  reflect proceeds from stock option exercises and stock purchase plan purchases slightly offset by payments on debt obligations 

table of contents we have no long term liabilities 
our long term contractual obligations for operating leases are as follows in thousands fiscal year ending september  thereafter total minimum lease payments the company uses a number of independent suppliers to manufacture substantially all of its products 
as a result  the company relies on these suppliers to allocate to the company a sufficient portion of foundry capacity to meet the company s needs and deliver sufficient quantities of the company s products on a timely basis 
these arrangements allow the company to avoid utilizing its capital resources for manufacturing facilities and work in process inventory and to focus substantially all of its resources on the design  development and marketing of its products 
the company requires substantial working capital to fund its business  particularly to finance accounts receivable and inventory  and for investments in property and equipment 
the company s need to raise capital in the future will depend on many factors including the rate of sales growth  market acceptance of the company s existing and new products  the amount and timing of research and development expenditures  the timing and size of acquisitions of businesses or technologies  the timing of the introduction of new products and the expansion of sales and marketing efforts 
we anticipate that our existing cash resources will fund any anticipated operating losses  purchases of capital equipment and provide adequate working capital for the next twelve months 
our liquidity is affected by many factors including  among others  the extent to which we pursue additional capital expenditures  the level of our product development efforts  and other factors related to the uncertainties of the industry and global economies 
accordingly  there can be no assurance that events in the future will not require us to seek additional capital sooner or  if so required  that such capital will be available at all or on terms acceptable to us 
trends  risks and uncertainties in future periods  hifn s business  financial condition and results of operations may be affected by many factors including  but not limited to  the following our operating results may fluctuate significantly 
our operating results have fluctuated significantly in the past and we expect that they will continue to fluctuate in the future 
this fluctuation is a result of a variety of factors including the following general business conditions in our markets as well as global economic uncertainty  increases or reductions in demand for our customers products  the timing and volume of orders we receive from our customers  cancellations or delays of customer product orders  acquisitions or mergers involving us  our competitors or customers  any new product introductions by us or our competitors  our suppliers increasing costs or changing the delivery of products to us  increased competition or reductions in the prices that we are able to charge  the variety of the products that we sell as well as seasonal demand for our products  and the availability of manufacturing capacity necessary to make our products 

table of contents if we determine that our long lived assets have been impaired or that our goodwill has been further impaired our financial condition and results of operations may suffer 
during fiscal and  we performed impairment analyses of goodwill and long lived and intangible assets and determined that impairment had been realized on certain developed technology and goodwill  resulting in recognition of impairment charges of million and million  respectively 
pursuant to sfas  goodwill and other intangible assets  we will continue to perform an annual impairment test and if  as a result of this analysis  we determine that there has been an impairment of our goodwill and other long lived and intangible assets  asset impairment charges will be recognized 
approximately million of goodwill remains as of september  we depend upon a small number of customers 
quantum corporation quantum  through its manufacturing subcontractor  accounted for approximately  and of our net revenues in fiscal  and  respectively 
cisco  an oem producer of network equipment  comprised of our net revenues for the year ended september  lucent  through its manufacturing subcontractor  accounted for approximately of our net revenues in fiscal neither quantum nor cisco is under any binding obligation to order from us 
if our sales to quantum or cisco decline  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we expect that our most significant customers in the future could be different from our largest customers today for a number of reasons  including customers deployment schedules and budget considerations 
as a result  we believe we may experience significant fluctuations in our results of operations on a quarterly and annual basis 
limited numbers of network and storage equipment vendors account for a majority of packet processor purchases in their respective markets 
in particular  the market for network equipment that would include packet processors  such as routers  remote access concentrators and firewalls  is dominated by a few large vendors  including cisco systems  inc  nortel networks  inc and com corporation 
as a result  our future success will depend upon our ability to establish and maintain relationships with these companies 
if these network equipment vendors do not incorporate our packet processors into their products  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our business depends upon the development of the packet processor market 
our prospects are dependent upon the acceptance of packet processors as an alternative to other technology traditionally utilized by network and storage equipment vendors 
many of our current and potential customers have substantial technological capabilities and financial resources and currently develop internally the application specific integrated circuit components and program the general purpose microprocessors utilized in their products as an alternative to our packet processors 
these customers may in the future continue to rely on these solutions or may determine to develop or acquire components  technologies or packet processors that are similar to  or that may be substituted for  our products 
in order to be successful  we must anticipate market trends and the price  performance and functionality requirements of such network and storage equipment vendors and must successfully develop and manufacture products that meet their requirements 
in addition  we must make products available to these large customers on a timely basis and at competitive prices 
if orders from customers are cancelled  decreased or delayed  or if we fail to obtain significant orders from new customers  or any significant customer delays or fails to pay  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
our business depends upon the continued growth and our penetration of the virtual private network market 
we want to be a leading supplier of packet processors that implement the network security protocols necessary to support the deployment of virtual private networks 
this market  which continues to evolve  may not grow 
alternatively  if it continues to grow  our products may not successfully serve this market 
our 
table of contents ability to generate significant revenue in the virtual private network market will depend upon  among other things  the following our ability to demonstrate the benefits of our technology to distributors  original equipment manufacturers and end users  and the increased use of the internet by businesses as replacements for  or enhancements to  their private networks 
if we are unable to penetrate the virtual private network market  or if that market fails to develop  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
we face risks associated with evolving industry standards and rapid technological change 
the markets in which we compete are characterized by rapidly changing technology  frequent product introductions and evolving industry standards 
our performance depends on a number of factors  including our ability to do the following properly identify emerging target markets and related technological trends  develop and maintain competitive products  develop end to end  ubiquitous systems solutions  develop  or partner with providers of  security services processors  develop both hardware and software security services solutions  enhance our products by adding innovative features that differentiate our products from those of competitors  bring products to market on a timely basis at competitive prices  and respond effectively to new technological changes or new product announcements by others 
our past success has been dependent in part upon our ability to develop products that have been selected for design into new products of leading equipment manufacturers 
however  the development of our packet processors is complex and  from time to time  we have experienced delays in completing the development and introduction of new products 
we may not be able to adhere to our new product design and introduction schedules and our products may not be accepted in the market at favorable prices  if at all 
in evaluating new product decisions  we must anticipate future demand for product features and performance characteristics  as well as available supporting technologies  manufacturing capacity  competitive product offerings and industry standards 
we must also continue to make significant investments in research and development in order to continue to enhance the performance and functionality of our products to keep pace with competitive products and customer demands for improved performance  features and functionality 
the technical innovations required for us to remain competitive are complicated and require a significant amount of time and money 
we may experience substantial difficulty in introducing new products and we may be unable to offer enhancements to existing products on a timely or cost effective basis  if at all 
for instance  the performance of our encryption compression and public key processors depends upon the integrity of our security technology 
if any significant advances in overcoming cryptographic systems are made  then the security of our encryption compression and public key processors will be reduced or eliminated unless we are able to develop further technical innovations that adequately enhance the security of these products 
our inability to develop and introduce new products or enhancements directed at new industry standards could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our markets are highly competitive 
we compete in markets that are intensely competitive and are expected to become increasingly competitive as current competitors expand their product offerings and new competitors enter the market 
the 
table of contents markets that we compete in are subject to frequent product introductions with improved price performance characteristics  rapid technological change  and the continued emergence of new industry standards 
our products compete with offerings from companies such as analog devices  inc  safenet  inc  ibm  broadcom corporation  motorola  inc and cavium networks 
hifn was a wholly owned subsidiary of stac  inc until hifn s spin off from stac in upon which stac assigned two license agreements entered into with ibm in in which stac granted ibm the right to use  but not sublicense  our patented compression technology in ibm hardware and software products 
stac also assigned its license agreement with microsoft corporation microsoft in whereby stac granted microsoft the right to use  but not sublicense  our compression technology in their software products 
we expect significant future competition from major domestic and international semiconductor suppliers 
several established electronics and semiconductor suppliers have recently entered  or expressed an interest to enter  the network equipment market 
we also may face competition from suppliers of products based on new or emerging technologies 
furthermore  many of our existing and potential customers internally develop solutions which attempt to perform all or a portion of the functions performed by our products 
a key element of our packet processor architecture is our encryption technology 
until recently  in order to export our encryption related products  the us department of commerce required us to obtain a license 
foreign competitors that were not subject to similar requirements have an advantage over us in their ability to establish existing markets for their products and rapidly respond to the requests of customers in the global market 
although the export restriction has been liberalized  we may not be successful in entering or competing in the foreign encryption markets 
see our products are subject to export restrictions 
many of our current and prospective competitors offer broader product lines and have significantly greater financial  technical  manufacturing and marketing resources than us 
as a result  they may be able to adapt more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to promote the sale of their products 
in particular  companies such as intel corporation  lucent technologies inc  motorola  inc  national semiconductor corporation and texas instruments incorporated have significant advantage over us given their relationships with many of our customers  their extensive marketing power and name recognition and their much greater financial resources 
in addition  current and potential competitors may decide to consolidate  lower the prices of their products or to bundle their products with other products 
any of the above would significantly and negatively impact our ability to compete and obtain or maintain market share 
if we are unable to successfully compete against our competitors  our business  results of operations and financial condition will suffer 
we believe that the important competitive factors in our markets are the following performance  price  the time that is required to develop a new product or enhancements to existing products  the ability to achieve product acceptance with major network and storage equipment vendors  the support that exists for new network and storage standards  features and functionality  adaptability of products to specific applications  reliability  and technical service and support as well as effective intellectual property protection 
if we are unable to successfully develop and market products that compete with those of other suppliers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed 
in addition  we must compete for the services of qualified distributors and sales representatives 
to the extent that our competitors offer distributors or sales representatives more favorable terms  these distributors and sales representatives may 
table of contents decline to carry  or discontinue carrying  our products 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be harmed by any failure to maintain and expand our distribution network 
our business depends upon the growth of the network equipment and storage equipment markets 
our success is largely dependent upon continued growth in the market for network security equipment  such as routers  remote access concentrators  switches  broadband access equipment  security gateways  firewalls and network interface cards 
in addition  our success depends upon storage equipment vendors incorporating our packet processors into their systems 
the network security equipment market has in the past  and may in the future  fluctuate significantly based upon numerous factors  including the lack of industry standards  adoption of alternative technologies  capital spending levels and general economic conditions 
we are unable to determine the rate or extent to which these markets will grow  if at all 
any decrease in the growth of the network or storage equipment market or a decline in demand for our products could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our success depends upon protecting our intellectual property 
our proprietary technology is critical to our future success 
we rely in part on patent  trade  trademark  maskwork and copyright law to protect our intellectual property 
we own eighteen united states patents and seven foreign patents 
we also have two pending patent applications in japan 
our issued patents and patent applications primarily cover various aspects of our compression  flow classification  bandwidth management and rate shaping technologies and have expiration dates ranging from to we have five pending patent applications in the united states  four in europe and asia japan covering our flow classification technology 
patents may not be issued under our current or future patent applications  and the patents issued under such patent applications could be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  third parties could make infringement claims against us in the future 
such infringement claims could result in costly litigation 
we may not prevail in any such litigation or be able to license any valid and infringed patents from third parties on commercially reasonable terms  if at all 
regardless of the outcome  an infringement claim would likely result in substantial cost and diversion of our resources 
any infringement claim or other litigation against us or by us could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the patents issued to us may not be adequate to protect our proprietary rights  to deter misappropriation or to prevent an unauthorized third party from copying our technology  designing around the patents we own or otherwise obtaining and using our products  designs or other information 
in addition  others could develop technologies that are similar or superior to our technology 
we also claim copyright protection for certain proprietary software and documentation 
we attempt to protect our trade secrets and other proprietary information through agreements with our customers  employees and consultants  and through other security measures 
however  our efforts may not be successful 
furthermore  the laws of certain countries in which our products are or may be manufactured or sold may not protect our products and intellectual property 
the length of time it takes to develop our products and make a sale to our customers may impair our operating results 
our customers typically take a long time to evaluate our products 
in fact  it usually takes our customers to months or more to test our products with an additional to months or more before they commence significant production of equipment incorporating our products 
as a result of this lengthy sales cycle  we may experience a delay between increasing expenses for research and development and sales and marketing efforts on the one hand  and the generation of higher revenues  if any  on the other hand 
in addition  the delays inherent in such a lengthy sales cycle raise additional risks of customer decisions to cancel or change product plans  which could result in the loss of anticipated sales 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer if customers reduce or delay orders or choose not to release products using our technology 

table of contents we depend upon independent manufacturers and limited sources of supply 
we rely on subcontractors to manufacture  assemble and test our packet processors 
we currently subcontract our semiconductor manufacturing to atmel corporation  toshiba corporation and philips semiconductor 
since we depend upon independent manufacturers  we do not directly control product delivery schedules or product quality 
none of our products are manufactured by more than one supplier 
since the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical  foundry capacity has been very limited at times in the past and may become limited in the future 
we depend on our suppliers to deliver sufficient quantities of finished product to us in a timely manner 
since we place orders on a purchase order basis and do not have long term volume purchase agreements with any of our suppliers  our suppliers may allocate production capacity to other products while reducing deliveries to us on short notice 
in the past  one of our suppliers delayed the delivery of one of our products 
as a result  we switched production of the product to a new manufacturer that caused a month delay in shipments to customers 
we have also experienced yield and test anomalies on a different product manufactured by another subcontractor that could have interrupted our customer shipments 
in this case  the manufacturer was able to correct the problem in a timely manner and customer shipments were not affected 
the delay and expense associated with qualifying a new supplier or foundry and commencing volume production can result in lost revenue  reduced operating margins and possible harm to customer relationships 
the steps required for a new manufacturer to begin production of a semiconductor product include adapting our product design  if necessary  to the new manufacturer s process  creating a new mask set to manufacture the product  having the new manufacturer prepare sample products so we can verify the product specification  and providing sample products to customers for qualification 
in general  it takes from to months for a new manufacturer to begin full scale production of one of our products 
we could have similar or more protracted problems in the future with existing or new suppliers 
toshiba corporation manufactures products for us in plants located in asia 
to date  the financial and stock market dislocations that have occurred in the asian financial markets in the past have not harmed our business 
however  present or future dislocations or other international business risks  such as currency exchange fluctuations or recessions  could force us to seek new suppliers 
we must place orders approximately to weeks in advance of expected delivery 
this limits our ability to react to fluctuations in demand for our products  and could cause us to have an excess or a shortage of inventory of a particular product 
in addition  if global semiconductor manufacturing capacity fails to increase in line with demand  foundries could allocate available capacity to larger customers or customers with long term supply contracts 
if we cannot obtain adequate foundry capacity at acceptable prices  or our supply is interrupted or delayed  our product revenues could decrease or our cost of revenues could increase 
this could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we regularly consider using smaller semiconductor dimensions for each of our products in order to reduce costs 
we have begun to decrease the dimensions in our new product designs  and believe that we must do so to remain competitive 
we may have difficulty decreasing the dimensions of our products 
in the future  we may change our supply arrangements to assume more product manufacturing responsibilities 
we may subcontract for wafer manufacturing  assembly and test rather than purchase finished products 
however  there are additional risks associated with manufacturing  including variances in production yields  the ability to obtain adequate test and assembly capacity at reasonable cost and other general risks associated with the manufacture of semiconductors 
we may also enter into volume purchase agreements that would require us to commit to minimum levels of purchases and which may require up front investments 
if we fail to effectively assume greater manufacturing responsibilities or manage volume purchase arrangements  our business  financial condition and results of operations will suffer 

table of contents network and storage equipment prices typically decrease 
average selling prices in the networking  storage and semiconductor industries have rapidly declined due to many factors  including rapidly changing technologies  price performance enhancements  and product obsolescence 
the decline in the average selling prices of our products may cause substantial fluctuations in our operating results 
we anticipate that the average selling prices of our products will decrease in the future due to product introductions by our competitors  price pressures from significant customers and other factors 
therefore  we must continue to develop and introduce new products that incorporate features which we can sell at higher prices 
if we fail to do so  our revenues and gross margins could decline  which would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face product return  product liability and product defect risks 
complex products such as ours frequently contain errors  defects and bugs when first introduced or as new versions are released 
we have discovered such errors  defects and bugs in the past 
delivery of products with production defects or reliability  quality or compatibility problems could hinder market acceptance of our products 
this could damage our reputation and harm our ability to attract and retain customers 
errors  defects or bugs could also cause interruptions  delays or a cessation of sales to our customers 
we would have to expend significant capital and resources to remedy these problems 
errors  defects or bugs could be discovered in our new products after we begin commercial production of them  despite testing by us and our suppliers and customers 
this could result in additional development costs  loss of  or delays in  market acceptance  diversion of technical and other resources from our other development efforts  claims by our customers or others against us or the loss of credibility with our current and prospective customers 
any such event would harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we face order and shipment uncertainties 
we generally make our sales under individual purchase orders that may be canceled or deferred by customers on short notice without significant penalty  if any 
cancellation or deferral of product orders could cause us to hold excess inventory  which could harm our profit margins and restrict our ability to fund our operations 
during fiscal  we recorded an excess inventory reserve of million as a result of a significant decrease in forecasted demand for our products 
we recognize revenue upon shipment of products to our customers  net of an allowance for estimated returns 
an unanticipated level of returns could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
we depend upon key personnel 
our success greatly depends on the continued contributions of our key management and other personnel  many of whom would be difficult to replace 
we do not have employment contracts with any of our key personnel  nor do we maintain any key man life insurance on any of our personnel 
it may be difficult for us to integrate new members of our management team 
we must also attract and retain experienced and highly skilled engineering  sales and marketing and managerial personnel 
competition for such personnel has  in the past  been intense in the geographic areas and market segments in which we compete  and we may not be successful in hiring and retaining such people 
if we lose the services of any key personnel  or cannot attract or retain qualified personnel  particularly engineers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
in addition  companies in technology industries whose employees accept positions with competitors have in the past claimed that their competitors have engaged in unfair competition or hiring practices 
we could receive such claims in the future as we seek to hire qualified personnel 
these claims could result in material litigation 
we could incur substantial costs in defending against any such claims  regardless of their merits 

table of contents our products are subject to export restrictions 
the encryption algorithms embedded in our products are a key element of our packet processor architecture 
these products are subject to us department of commerce export control restrictions 
our network equipment customers may only export products incorporating encryption technology if they obtain a one time technical review 
these us export laws also prohibit the export of encryption products to a number of countries deemed by the us to be hostile 
many foreign countries also restrict exports to many of these countries deemed to be terrorist supporting states by the us government 
because the restrictions on exports of encryption products have been liberalized  we  along with our network equipment customers have an opportunity to effectively compete with our foreign competitors 
the existence of these restrictions until recently may have enabled foreign competitors facing less stringent controls on their products to become more established and  therefore  more competitive in the global market than our network equipment customers 
in addition  the list of products and countries for which export approval is required  and the regulatory policies with respect thereto  could be revised  and laws limiting the domestic use of encryption could be enacted 
while the us government now allows us companies to assume that exports to non government end users will be approved within days of official registration with the department of commerce  the sale of our packet processors could be harmed by the failure of our network equipment customers to obtain the required approvals or by the costs of compliance 
we face risks associated with our international business activities 
we sell most of our products to customers in the united states 
if our international sales increase  particularly in light of decreased export restrictions  we may encounter risks inherent in international operations 
all of our international sales to date are denominated in us dollars 
as a result  if the value of the us dollar increases relative to foreign currencies  our products could become less competitive in international markets 
we also obtain some of our manufacturing  assembly and test services from suppliers located outside the united states 
international business activities could be limited or disrupted by any of the following the imposition of governmental controls  export license technical review requirements  restrictions on the export of technology  currency exchange fluctuations  political instability  financial and stock market dislocations  military and related activities  trade restrictions  and changes in tariffs 
demand for our products also could be harmed by seasonality of international sales and economic conditions in our primary overseas markets 
these international factors could harm future sales of our products to international customers and our business  financial condition and results of operations in general 
we face risks associated with acquisitions 
we continually evaluate strategic acquisitions of businesses and technologies that would complement our product offerings or enhance our market coverage or technological capabilities and may make additional acquisitions in the future 
future acquisitions could be effected without stockholder approval  and could cause us to dilute shareholder equity  incur debt and contingent liabilities and amortize acquisition expenses related 
table of contents to intangible assets  any of which could harm our operating results and or the price of our common stock 
acquisitions entail numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilating acquired operations  technologies and products  diversion of management s attention from other business concerns  risks of entering markets in which we have little or no prior experience  and loss of key employees of acquired organizations 
we may not be able to successfully integrate businesses  products  technologies or personnel that we acquire 
if we fail to do so  our business  financial condition and results of operations could suffer 
the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry may harm our business 
the semiconductor industry has experienced significant downturns and wide fluctuations in supply and demand 
the industry has also experienced significant fluctuations in anticipation of changes in general economic conditions 
this has caused significant variances in product demand  production capacity and rapid erosion of average selling prices 
industry wide fluctuations in the future could harm our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our stock price may be volatile 
the market price of our common stock has fluctuated in the past and is likely to fluctuate in the future 
in addition  the securities markets have experienced significant price and volume fluctuations and the market prices of the securities of technology related companies including networking  storage and semiconductor companies have been especially volatile 
such fluctuations can result from quarterly variations in operating results  announcements of new products by us or our competitors  the gain or loss of significant customers  changes in analysts estimates  short selling of our common stock  and events affecting other companies that investors deem to be comparable to us 
we have been engaged in securities class action lawsuits 
during fiscal  we completed the settlement terms of the class action complaint and had shareholder derivative actions dismissed 
as of september   there were no outstanding claims against us and we did not have any outstanding obligations 
details relating to the class action complaint and the shareholder derivative actions are as follows in  a class action complaint was filed against us and certain of our officers and directors alleging that hifn and certain of its officers and directors violated federal securities laws in connection with various public statements made during the class period 
in may  a settlement agreement was reached and in september  a final judgment and order of dismissal with prejudice was issued by the court 
under the terms of the settlement  all claims were dismissed without any admission of liability or wrongdoing by any defendant  and the shareholder class received million  comprised of million in cash  which was contributed by our insurance carriers  and the balance in hifn common stock aggregating  shares  valued at million  based on the agreed price of per share 
the cash and common stock settlements were distributed in september we are not obligated to perform any additional action and consider the class action litigation to be resolved

sfas  accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
the statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity and further requires that an issuer classify as a liability or an asset in some circumstances financial instruments that fall within its scope because that financial instrument embodies an obligation of the issuer 
many of such instruments were previously classified as equity 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may   and otherwise is effective at the beginning of the first interim period beginning after june   except for mandatory redeemable financial instruments of nonpublic entities
