item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information on allegheny s credit ratings 
the ability to enter into and maintain transactions within the energy trading markets is heavily dependent on a market participant s credit rating 
as a general matter  market participants rated below investment grade cannot enter into or maintain positions in the energy markets to hedge their physical delivery obligations absent credit support or the posting of collateral 
the october ratings downgrades triggered collateral calls by allegheny s trading counterparties 
ae supply s cash position did not permit the posting of requisite collateral and  in october  ae supply was in violation of covenants under certain trading contracts 
the violations triggered breaches under the terms of ae s  ae supply s  and agc s principal credit facilities 
ae  ae supply  and agc were able to obtain successive temporary waivers to keep facilities in place pending debt restructuring 
weaker than expected operating results and the credit rating downgrades  together with the concerns regarding the energy trading market described above  also rendered it impossible to undertake an anticipated public equity financing by ae 
ae supply s access to capital was severely constrained by the fourth quarter of ae supply continued to settle its trades as they came due  but needed to be very selective as to its collateral posting 
many counterparties  as a result  exercised their contractual right to terminate their trades with ae supply  leaving ae supply s trading portfolio with unhedged positions 
these unhedged positions were substantial and were a source of significant uncertainty regarding allegheny s forward cash position and financial results 
ae supply had sought to use the energy trading markets to lock in the long term profitability of its portfolio of positions 
ae supply s cash position and credit rating in the fourth quarter of did not permit it the flexibility to enter into significant new long term trading arrangements  but rather required it to manage its exposures on a short term basis 
due to collateral posting obligations that attached to most of ae supply s trading positions  and given its credit ratings  the volatility of ae supply s cash position has been generally reduced by the removal of trading positions from its portfolio 
in  ae has pursued a strategy of terminating or assigning trading positions where practicable 
as described below under allegheny s response  allegheny has recently exited the western united states power markets 
in september  allegheny sold the cdwr contract and hedges associated with those contracts 
these related hedges had maturities through most of allegheny s remaining positions will expire by the end of the reduction in the average maturity of allegheny s trading positions will reduce volatility in allegheny s collateral posting obligations and the absolute size of potential collateral posting requirements associated with financial transactions 
terminations of groups of positions with zero value on an aggregate net mark to market basis have also been possible from time to time  however  where counterparty credit is below stable investment grade  assignment has been difficult or impracticable 
allegheny s liquidity position and financial results  combined with asset writedowns  have made raising capital complex and challenging 
allegheny s capital raising activities are subject to constraints imposed by the covenants contained in the agreements governing outstanding indebtedness  including the borrowing facilities negotiated in february  and in the indenture entered into in july in connection with ae s issuance of convertible trust preferred securities 
ae and ae supply do not currently maintain the minimum equity ratio required as a condition of its key financing authorizations under puhca and  as a result  further financings are precluded absent sec authorization 
the process of obtaining required regulatory authorizations or lender consents has caused significant delays and imposed additional costs on asset sales and other capital raising transactions and has jeopardized the ability of allegheny to enter into certain planned transactions 
the marketplace rules affecting allegheny also changed markedly in in january  the federal energy regulatory commission ferc authorized the distribution companies and pjm to proceed with 
table of contents broadening the scope and regional configuration of pjm to include the distribution companies  via an arrangement known as pjm west  effective april  with the addition of our service area  pjm s control area now extends over the states of delaware  maryland  and new jersey  most of pennsylvania and west virginia and portions of ohio and virginia 
the agreements establishing pjm west required us to adopt pjm s transmission pricing methodology  including pjm s congestion management system  and expanded pjm s day ahead and real time energy markets to include pjm west 
as a result  energy suppliers are now able to reach consumers anywhere within the expanded pjm market at a single transmission rate  instead of paying multiple transmission rates 
the formation of pjm west expands ae supply s primary market 
however  the distribution companies may in the future realize reduced revenues as a result of the elimination of transmission seams between allegheny and pjm and revised congestion pricing mechanisms 
nevertheless  in  and continuing through the end of the transition period established by the ferc  the distribution companies will continue to collect lost revenues through transitional mechanisms accepted by the ferc 
at the end of the transition period  the reduction in revenues for the distribution companies in the aggregate could amount to more than million annually 
for a further discussion of the effect that the ferc s policy has on the allegheny companies  see regulatory framework affecting allegheny federal regulation  below 
continuing challenges allegheny s credit ratings and liquidity issues persisted into allegheny has not reported interim financial information for the first or second quarter of allegheny faces significant challenges in bringing required reporting up to date and making timely filings in the future 
internal control issues remain and need to be addressed 
in addition  difficult market conditions and the effect of allegheny s weakened credit profile have had a continuing substantial adverse effect on operations  and it is anticipated that consolidated earnings and cash flow results  when reported  will be substantially below the levels indicated in the projections released by ae in february  following its bank refinancing 
in june  ae announced that its common equity ratio common equity to total capitalization  including short term debt  for puhca purposes  had fallen below the level required under its key sec financing authorizations 
based upon preliminary data  it is estimated that ae s equity ratio is below percent  and the equity ratio at ae supply is below percent 
as a result  ae and ae supply have had to  and will continue to be required to  obtain special ad hoc authorizations from the sec to engage in financings  asset sales  and other activities critical to near term viability 
absent such authorizations  allegheny will have very limited flexibility to meet expected liquidity requirements or to address contingencies 
the common equity ratio has fallen below its previously projected level due to several factors 
first  ae supply had to take substantial write downs in connection with recognized reductions in trading position values to reflect then current market conditions and revised valuation techniques and assumptions 
second  further write downs were triggered by the renegotiation of supply contracts and the cancellation of suspended generation projects 
finally  allegheny s financial performance and cash flows in have been  and continue to be  substantially weaker than earlier projected 
forward natural gas and power prices increased significantly from the third quarter of through the second quarter of  resulting in collateral requirements that have exceeded expectations by more than million 
in addition  these rising prices caused ae supply to decide to prepay for approximately million of natural gas and power supplies necessary as a hedge against its power delivery obligations during the summer of counterparty terminations of trading contracts left ae supply short of power during  requiring shortfalls to be satisfied by spot market purchases at times when spot market prices were higher than expected 
as a result of these developments  allegheny s liquidity continued to come under pressure through the summer of until many of the trading book restructuring activities discussed below could be implemented 
allegheny s response upon re examining its business model and structure  allegheny has adopted a long term strategy of focusing on the core generation and t d businesses in which it has been historically engaged 
allegheny will 
table of contents seek  consistent with regulatory constraints  to manage its business lines as an integrated whole 
implementing this strategy will be a significant challenge  in part  because of the continuing legacy of past transactions that have negatively impacted allegheny s operations and financial condition 
allegheny has taken a number of recent actions to improve its financial condition and reorient its business  which have included substantial senior management changes  completion of key financing transactions  exiting from western energy markets  refocusing trading activities  asset sales  restructuring and cost reducing initiatives  and improving internal controls and reporting 
substantial senior management changes allegheny s senior management was changed substantially in as allegheny reoriented its business model and addressed the need to improve its financial condition

table of contents refinancing principal credit facilities 
on february   ae  ae supply  monongahela and west penn entered into agreements borrowing facilities with various credit providers to refinance and restructure the bulk of their short term debt 
the borrowing facilities provided ae supply with million of immediate liquidity 
the borrowing facilities also extended short term debt maturities 
ae and ae supply will be required to make substantial amortization payments on the borrowing facility indebtedness in the fourth quarter of and in private placement 
on july   allegheny raised million million after deducting various fees and placement agents commissions from the issuance to a special purpose finance subsidiary of ae of units comprised of million principal amount of notes due and warrants for the purchase of up to million shares of ae s common stock  exercisable at per share 
the warrants are mandatorily exercisable if ae s common stock price equals or exceeds per share over a specified averaging period occurring after june  the warrants are attached to the notes and may be exercised only through the tender of the notes 
the finance subsidiary obtained the proceeds required to purchase the units by issuing million total liquidation amount of its mandatorily convertible trust preferred securities to investors in a private placement 
the preferred securities entitle the holders to distributions on a corresponding principal amount of notes and to direct the exercise of warrants attached to the notes in order to effect the conversion of the preferred securities into ae common stock 
ae guarantees the finance subsidiary s payment obligations on the preferred securities 
in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles  allegheny s consolidated balance sheet will reflect the notes as long term debt 
the notes  and ae s guarantee of the preferred securities  are subordinated only to indebtedness arising under the agreements governing certain of allegheny s indebtedness under the borrowing facilities 
exiting from western energy markets allegheny worked through to accomplish ae supply s effective exit from the western united states power markets 
its positions based in the western united states had been a substantial source of earnings and cash flow volatility and risk  and trading in these markets does not fit with allegheny s current strategy 
renegotiation and sale of cdwr contract 
in june  ae supply entered into a settlement agreement with the state of california to resolve the state s litigation regarding its power supply contract with the cdwr 
the terms of the settlement reduced the volume of power to be delivered from and reduced the sale price of off peak power to be delivered from  which in turn substantially reduced the value of the contract 
on september   allegheny closed the sale of the contract and associated hedge transactions  to j 
aron company  a subsidiary of the goldman sachs group  inc  for approximately million 
allegheny has applied million of the sale proceeds to required payments under agreements entered into to terminate tolling agreements with williams energy marketing and trading company williams and las vegas cogeneration ii lv cogen  a unit of black hills corporation  as described below 
allegheny will apply an additional million of the proceeds to make required payments in march and september of under the agreement with williams 
approximately million will be held in a pledged account for the benefit of ae supply s creditors 
this arrangement is intended to enhance ae supply s ability to refinance certain secured borrowings 
approximately million of the sale proceeds was placed in escrow for the benefit of j 
aron company  pending allegheny s fulfillment of certain post closing requirements 
when the escrowed funds are released  approximately million will be added to the pledged account and ae supply will receive the balance 
the remaining million of sale proceeds will be used to partially offset certain of the hedges related to the cdwr contract and to pay fees and expenses associated with the transaction 
agreement to terminate williams toll 
in july  ae supply entered into a conditional agreement with williams to terminate its  mw tolling agreement with williams 
under the agreement  ae supply made an initial payment to williams of approximately million to satisfy certain amounts under a related hedge agreement 
allegheny made a million payment to williams after the close of the sale of the cdwr contract 
allegheny will make two payments of million to williams in march and september of the tolling agreement will terminate when the final million payment is made 

table of contents termination of lv cogen toll 
in mid september  ae supply terminated its mw tolling agreement with lv cogen 
allegheny made a million termination payment to lv cogen after the closing of the sale of the cdwr contract 
after completing these major transactions  allegheny s remaining trading exposures to the western market will consist of several shorter term trades that hedged the cdwr contract and several long term hedges of the lv cogen tolling agreement 
allegheny is seeking to unwind these remaining positions  totaling  mwh of net purchases through the end of  and one million mwh of net purchases from through refocusing trading activities adoption of asset based trading strategy 
ae supply is reorienting its trading operations from high volume financial trading in national markets to asset optimization and hedging within its region 
ae supply is implementing this rebalancing over time as its liquidity allows 
effectively exiting the western power markets  together with unwinding substantial non core trading positions  has enabled ae supply to reduce long term trading related cash outflows and collateral obligations 
in the future  ae supply will seek to concentrate its efforts in pjm  the midwest  and mid atlantic markets where it has a physical presence and greater market knowledge 
ultimately  ae supply intends to conduct asset optimization and hedging activities with the primary objective of locking in cash flows associated with ae supply s portfolio of core physical generating and load positions 
relocation of trading operations 
ae supply moved its energy marketing operations from new york to monroeville  pennsylvania on may  and has reduced its trading operations 
this transition will result in ongoing cost savings and improve integration with ae supply s generation activity 
the reduced staffing levels are intended to reflect the newly revised focus of the trading function 
management believes that both trading and marketing and generation operations can be enhanced by locating trading personnel closer to personnel managing ae supply s generating assets 
personnel involved in the separate functions can be cross trained and will be better positioned to enhance the relationship between the two functions 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding charges incurred in connection with relocating the trading operations 
asset sales in  allegheny announced that it was considering selling assets as part of an overall strategy to address its liquidity requirements 
allegheny has achieved the sale of its most significant assets with a nexus to the western united states 
allegheny has also closed the sale of its interest in the conemaugh generating station  as described below 
allegheny continues to consider the sale of additional assets  especially non core assets 
land sales 
effective february   west penn  through its subsidiary  west virginia power and transmission company  sold  acres of land in canaan valley  west virginia  to the us fish wildlife service for million 
effective december   it also sold a  acre tract of land for million and made a charitable contribution of a acre tract in canaan valley  west virginia  to canaan valley institute 
fellon mccord and alliance energy services  llc 
effective december   ae sold fellon mccord  its natural gas and electricity consulting and management services firm  and alliance energy services  llc alliance energy services  a provider of natural gas supply and transportation services  to constellation energy group for approximately million 
conemaugh generating station 
on june   ae supply completed the sale of its mw share of the coal fired conemaugh generating station  located near johnstown  pennsylvania  to a subsidiary of ugi corporation  ugi  for approximately million  which does not include a contingent amount of million 
this contingent amount could be received in full  in part  or not at all  depending upon ae supply s performance of certain post closing obligations 

table of contents restructuring and cost reducing initiatives allegheny has taken several actions to align its operations with its strategy and reduce its cost structure 
termination of non core construction activity 
in  ae supply ceased construction and planning of various merchant generation projects to attempt to conserve cash and other resources and focus its resources on its core generating assets 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding charges incurred for the termination of generating projects 
restructuring of operations 
in july  allegheny announced a restructuring plan intended to strengthen its financial performance by  among other things  reducing its workforce 
allegheny has achieved workforce reductions of more than percent through a voluntary early retirement option ero program and selected staff reductions 
in  approximately eligible employees accepted the ero program resulting in a charge of million  before income taxes 
allegheny has essentially completed these planned workforce reductions 
allegheny will continue to take actions intended to reduce costs and improve productivity in all of its operations 
suspension of dividend 
the board of directors of ae determined not to declare a dividend on ae s common stock for the fourth quarter of covenants contained in allegheny s new borrowing facilities entered into in february  and in the indenture entered into in connection with the convertible trust preferred securities issuance in july  as well as regulatory limitations under puhca  are expected to preclude ae from declaring or paying cash dividends for the foreseeable future 
elimination of preemptive rights 
on march   ae s common stockholders approved an amendment to ae s articles of incorporation eliminating common stockholders preemptive rights 
the elimination of preemptive rights removed an obstacle to ae s ability to privately place equity or convertible securities 
improving internal controls and reporting comprehensive accounting review 
commencing in the third quarter of  allegheny undertook a comprehensive and extended review of its financial information and internal controls and procedures 
this review included continuous efforts by allegheny s management and directors and extensive involvement of independent auditors and other outside professional service firms 
allegheny continues to address its controls environment and reporting procedures  as well as its sec filing and other outstanding reporting obligations 
see item controls and procedures and note to ae s consolidated financial statements for a detailed discussion 

table of contents special note regarding forward looking statements in addition to historical information  this report contains a number of forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of words such as anticipate  expect  project  intend  plan  believe  and words and terms of similar substance used in connection with any discussion of future plans  actions  or events identify forward looking statements 
these include statements with respect to regulation and the status of retail generation service supply competition in states served by the distribution companies  the closing of various agreements  execution of restructuring activity and liquidity enhancement plans  results of litigation  financing requirements and plans to meet those requirements  demand for energy and the cost and availability of inputs  demand for products and services  capacity purchase commitments  results of operations  capital expenditures  regulatory matters  internal controls and procedures and outstanding financial reporting obligations  accounting issues  and stockholder rights plan 
forward looking statements involve estimates  expectations  and projections and  as a result  are subject to risks and uncertainties 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not materially differ from expectations 
actual results have varied materially and unpredictably from past expectations 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially include  among others  the following execution of restructuring activity and liquidity enhancement plans  complications or other factors that render it difficult or impossible to obtain necessary lender consents or regulatory authorizations on a timely basis  general economic and business conditions  changes in access to capital markets  the continuing effects of global instability  terrorism  and war  changes in industry capacity  development  and other activities by allegheny s competitors  changes in the weather and other natural phenomena  changes in technology  changes in the price of power and fuel for electric generation  changes in the underlying inputs  including market conditions  and assumptions used to estimate the fair values of commodity contracts  changes in laws and regulations applicable to allegheny  its markets  or its activities  
table of contents environmental regulations  the loss of any significant customers and suppliers  the effect of accounting policies issued periodically by accounting standard setting bodies  additional collateral calls  and changes in business strategy  operations  or development plans 
risk factors we are subject to a variety of significant risks in addition to the matters set forth under special note regarding forward looking statements above 
risks applicable to us include risks unique to us in our current circumstances  such as the risks described under risks related to trading market exposures  risks associated with our capital structure and capital requirements  risks related to our internal controls and procedures and to our business model transition  and risks related to legal proceedings  risks that currently face us and similarly situated companies in light of recent events and trends  such as the risks described under risks associated with competition  other risks associated with our business  risks associated with regulation  risks related to our reliance on other companies and risks associated with environmental regulation  and risks that generally affect us and similarly situated companies  such as the risks described under risks associated with the capital intensive nature of our business 
our susceptibility to certain risks could exacerbate other risks 
these risk factors should be considered carefully in evaluating our risk profile 
risks related to trading market exposures our cash position is highly vulnerable to market volatility 
because of ae supply s credit rating  it generally must post collateral to trading counterparties to the extent that its net obligations under energy trading transactions with a counterparty are in favor of the counterparty relative to the market 
likewise  many counterparties are required to post collateral in favor of ae supply 
however  because of ae supply s credit rating  ae supply must place collateral received in a custodial account 
thus  this collateral cannot be used to post to other counterparties 
ae s and ae supply s liquidity positions have limited ae supply s ability to enter into transactions on a timely basis to hedge its open positions 
as a result  it has had to reactively manage its open positions on a short term basis in the volatile spot market 
in addition  counterparties have terminated certain trading agreements with ae supply that would have permitted ae supply to maintain hedges against power delivery obligations or fuel purchase requirements 
these circumstances leave ae and ae supply highly vulnerable to shifts in market prices for energy and other commodities until such time as ae supply is able to retire or hedge its open positions 
ae supply must also satisfy short positions in the volatile spot market  which has been more expensive than projected 
as a result of these factors  our cash position and results of operations in recent periods have been subject to commodity market volatility to a greater extent than prior to the third quarter of if we are unable to meet ongoing collateral posting requirements or other cash delivery obligations  we may default on energy trading contracts  which may trigger defaults under our credit agreements and other contracts 
if our cash and cash equivalent assets are not sufficient  after application to our cash delivery obligations under our commodity contract positions to meet our debt service obligations  we could default under our debt facilities 

table of contents we face significant obstacles to implementing our strategy of rebalancing our market positions to hedge our physical power supply commitments and resource requirements 
we are seeking to unwind commodity contracts that are not necessary to hedge our physical delivery obligations  with a view to refocusing ae supply s trading and marketing activities around core physical assets 
we are facing substantial obstacles to implementing this strategy 
our lack of liquidity has rendered it difficult for us to eliminate unnecessary or cash draining positions 
our current credit rating and lack of liquidity have also led to reluctance on the part of counterparties to increase exposure to us  which has in turn complicated efforts to establish new hedged positions 
where a counterparty s credit is below investment grade  assignment of our positions to third parties may be impracticable 
overall  market liquidity  particularly in long term electricity and natural gas markets  has significantly declined over the past two years 
absent a return to more liquid levels  it may not be possible for ae supply to hedge all of its open trading positions and retire unnecessary positions 
our credit position has also rendered it difficult for us to hedge our power supply obligations and fuel requirements 
some trading counterparties have terminated trades with us that we entered into to hedge such obligations 
in the absence of effective hedges for these purposes  we must satisfy power and fuel shortfalls in the spot markets  which are volatile and have been more costly than expected 
even a balanced  asset based portfolio would render us vulnerable to risks 
our risk management  wholesale marketing  fuel procurement and energy trading activities  including our decisions to enter into power sales agreements  rely on models that depend on judgments and assumptions regarding factors such as the future market prices and demand for electricity and other energy related commodities 
even when our policies and procedures are followed and decisions are made based on these models  there may  nevertheless  be an adverse effect on our financial position and results of operations  if the judgments and assumptions underlying those models prove to be inaccurate 
our trading portfolio exposes us to counterparty credit risks 
our ability to use hedging instruments to protect us from price and demand volatility will only be effective to the extent that we can rely on the performance of our trading counterparties 
market participant credit quality has been a pervasive concern in the energy industry for some time 
we have been and continue to be exposed to counterparties that may not be willing or able to meet their contractual obligations 
risks associated with our capital structure and capital requirements ae supply must obtain significant additional financing from outside sources in the near future 
ae supply s borrowing facilities as defined below require ae supply to make a cash principal payment of million by the end of december  million by the end of september  and million by the end of december ae supply expects to make the december payment 
for the remaining payment schedule  if ae supply cannot raise the total principal amount in a timely manner  it would be in default under the borrowing facilities  which would also cause us to be in default under other contracts  including the indenture entered into in connection with our july issuance of convertible trust preferred securities 
we are exploring refinancing amounts due under our borrowing facilities 
however  there cannot be any assurance that any refinancing will actually occur 

table of contents there is a risk that ae supply may not be able to obtain required financing in a timely manner 
aspects of the current situation that render obtaining financing difficult include the delay in our filing audited financial statements  delays in satisfying other sec reporting requirements  our ineligibility to avail ourselves of the shelf registration process until we have been current in our sec filings for the required time period  equity ratios below the minimum levels required under our key puhca financing authorizations  potential concerns regarding our internal controls  the covenants in our borrowing facilities and in the indenture for the debt securities underlying our convertible preferred securities constrain our financing activities  capital market volatility due to geopolitical and economic factors  current credit ratings below investment grade  our overall financial condition  and past violations of covenants under our borrowing facilities and commodity contracts 
as part of our plan to restore our liquidity  we may engage in further asset sales  however  market conditions and other factors limit the availability of this strategy 
we may seek to sell additional assets or businesses in order to improve our liquidity 
sale prices for energy assets and businesses have been and could remain weak due to prevailing conditions in the market for such assets and businesses 
asset sales under such conditions could result in the incurrence of substantial losses 
the current state of the energy industry has resulted in an increased number of sellers of generating assets and has limited the number of potential buyers for generating assets 
buyers may also find it difficult to obtain financing to purchase salable assets 
several factors specific to allegheny have rendered asset sales particularly challenging 
allegheny is subject to constraints under puhca and in the covenants under the borrowing facilities  which have imposed delays and structuring complications on asset sale transactions 
potential buyers may be reluctant to enter into agreements to purchase assets from us if they believe that required consents and approvals will result in inordinate delays or uncertainties in the transaction process 
covenants contained in our principal financing agreements restrict our operating  financing  and investing activities 
in february and march  we entered into borrowing facilities in connection with the refinancing of the bulk of ae and ae supply s short term indebtedness 
the borrowing facilities include facilities at ae supply a million credit facility at ae supply  of which million is secured by substantially all the assets of ae supply

table of contents agc s indenture also restricts additional secured borrowings 
ae supply has pledged its assets to secure its obligations under the borrowing facilities 
the terms of the borrowing facilities will limit our ability to make strategic decisions 
covenant restrictions limit our ability to access capital markets without using the proceeds to reduce the outstanding principal of the borrowing facilities 
our cash payment obligations and covenant restrictions will prevent us from pursuing a growth or acquisition strategy for several years 
these obligations could also limit our ability to make capital expenditures  both for added capacity and existing facilities 
ae supply borrowed  million under the borrowing facilities and restructured a note debt 
of that amount   million is secured by either ae supply s new generating facility in springdale  pennsylvania  or substantially all of ae supply s other assets

ae and ae supply and certain of their subsidiaries  including monongahela and agc  are also required to meet annual and quarterly reporting requirements under the terms of borrowing arrangements  including the borrowing facilities 
ae and ae supply have obtained waivers under the borrowing facilities from compliance with these covenants through september with respect to its annual reporting requirements and temporary waivers with respect to certain quarterly reporting requirements 
allegheny has several other debt agreements that require filings of quarterly and annual reports under the securities exchange act of these debt agreements generally also require the obligor to file compliance certificates with the trustees under the agreements indicating that the obligor is in compliance with all of the covenants 
on april   allegheny provided certificates indicating that it was not in compliance with certain reporting obligations under certain first mortgage bonds and debentures 
these covenant breaches are deemed defaults of the related indebtedness  as 
table of contents well as defaults of indebtedness subject to cross acceleration with such first mortgage bonds and debentures including certain pollution control bonds and other indebtedness  for financial reporting purposes 
to date  the debt holders have not provided allegheny with any notices of default under the agreements 
such notices  if received  would allow allegheny days to cure noncompliance before the debt holders could accelerate the due date of the related debt 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further information regarding our compliance status under agreements governing our indebtedness 
the terms of the borrowing facilities expose us to interest rate risk 
the borrowing facilities require us to pay interest calculated at a spread over libor or another designated rate  both variable rates 
if interest rates rise  we will be required to meet higher debt service obligations 
if our operational cash flows do not increase proportionately with interest rate increases  we may have difficulty meeting our debt service obligations 
required payments on our substantial indebtedness will absorb a large portion of our cash flows and will limit our ability to raise capital for purposes other than debt repayment 
the substantial level of our indebtedness will require us to apply much of our cash flow to our principal and interest obligations 
our operations and other activities must be directed to ensuring that our cash position will be sufficient to satisfy these obligations in a timely manner 
under the terms of the borrowing facilities  we will be required to apply the proceeds of asset sales and securities issuances to repay the borrowing facilities 
we must apply to our debt as follows percent of the proceeds of sales of assets of ae and subsidiaries other than ae supply and its subsidiaries  up to million  and percent thereafter  percent of the proceeds of sales of assets of ae supply and its subsidiaries up to million  and percent thereafter  excluding ae supply s new facility in springdale  pennsylvania  percent of the proceeds of any sale of ae supply s new facility in springdale  pennsylvania  percent of the net proceeds of debt issuances excluding specified exemptions  including an exemption of up to million for the distribution companies and an exemption for refinancings meeting certain criteria  percent of net proceeds from equity issuances  percent of ae and its subsidiaries excluding ae supply s and its subsidiaries excess cash flow as defined under the borrowing facilities  and percent of ae supply s excess cash flow as defined under the borrowing facilities 
the terms of the indenture entered into by ae in connection with the issuance of convertible trust preferred securities contains a covenant that requires ae and its regulated utility subsidiaries to apply the proceeds of certain asset sales to repay indebtedness under the indenture 
this covenant would become effective in the event that the borrowing facilities were terminated  provided that ae had not entered into an analogous covenant under a credit facility entered into to refinance the borrowing facilities 
our liquidity position adversely affects our operations 
in connection with regulations governing the transition to market competition  monongahela with respect to its ohio customers  potomac edison  and west penn are required to provide electricity to retail customers who do not choose an alternate electricity generation supplier and to those who return to utility service from alternate suppliers 
during the transition periods in the states in which it serves  each distribution company satisfies its provider of last resort plr obligation by sourcing power from ae supply under a long term power sales agreement 
our lack of liquidity may also render it difficult for us to derive the maximum value otherwise available in the market of energy produced above our plr obligations  thereby reducing revenues realizable from operations 

table of contents our liquidity position and resultant credit rating downgrades have adversely affected our ability to enter into long term executory contracts  generally due to collateral posting requirements 
this has made it difficult for us to enter into long term supply and other arrangements 
with fewer long term supply contracts  we will have greater exposure to short term market price volatility and availability constraints 
provisions of maryland law and puhca  and the terms of our constituent documents and of contracts we have entered into could deter unsolicited third party acquisition offers and limit outside investment in us 
provisions of ae s bylaws and anti takeover provisions of maryland law could make it difficult for an unsolicited third party to acquire control of ae 
the anti takeover provisions of maryland law discourage control share acquisitions  include fair price and freeze out provisions  and endorse stockholder rights plans 
as permitted by maryland law  ae s bylaws provide for a classified board  with board members serving staggered three year terms 
aesc has executed change in control agreements with key officers that contain provisions that may make it more expensive to effect a change in control and replace incumbent management 
while the purpose of the staggered board is to prevent abusive takeover tactics and to protect stockholders investments in ae  it could have the effect of preventing or making more difficult an acquisition or change in control that shareholders  in their judgment  might have favored 
further  our subsidiaries are party to various contracts which are terminable upon an unsolicited or other change of control 
provisions of puhca may also require that an investor or acquiror obtain approval prior to acquiring a significant stake in us 
ae has a stockholder rights plan  which entitles existing stockholders to purchase shares of common stock at a substantial discount in the event of an acquisition of percent or more of our outstanding common stock or an unsolicited tender offer for those shares 
the board of directors of ae has voted to redeem the stockholder rights under the plan  but this redemption may not take place before required authorizations are obtained  including sec authorization under puhca 
ae cannot pay dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future 
covenants contained in the borrowing facilities  terms of the indenture entered into in connection with the issuance of convertible trust preferred securities  and regulatory limitations under puhca will preclude ae from paying dividends on its common stock for the foreseeable future 
certain institutions and other investors may not or do not purchase non dividend paying equity securities 
we may engage in further asset sales  which would expose us to attendant risks and liabilities 
we are exploring the option of selling selected assets  especially non core assets 
risks commonly encountered in connection with asset sale activity include incorrectly valuing assets  retaining liabilities  and diverting management and other resources to asset sale transactions and away from continuing operations 
adverse market conditions could reduce potential asset sale proceeds and could require that we link load commitments to generating assets as a buyer s condition to purchasing our salable assets  thus depriving us of a long term source of cash flow 
further sales of generating assets would also reduce ae supply s total generating capacity  which could compromise our ability to meet load requirements of the distribution companies or capitalize on future increases in commodity prices 

table of contents we are engaging in ongoing restructuring and cost cutting efforts  which expose us to attendant risks 
we have undertaken various restructuring and cost cutting efforts  including workforce reductions  the wind down and relocation of our energy trading operations  and the suspension and discontinuation of generating facility construction 
in july  as part of our cost cutting efforts  we announced our intent to reduce our workforce of approximately  by approximately percent 
we achieved workforce reductions of approximately percent through a voluntary ero program  and selected staff reductions 
the ero program offered enhanced pension and medical benefits and required eligible employees to make an election 
in  we incurred a non cash charge of million before income taxes in connection with this program 
we also offered a staffing reduction separation program srsp for employees whose positions are being eliminated as part of the workforce reductions 
we recorded a charge of million related to the approximately employees whose positions have been or are being eliminated 
these workforce reductions are essentially complete 
the reorganization of ae supply s energy trading division included the relocation of the trading operations and resulted in a charge of approximately million  before income taxes  related to costs associated with the relocation 
we may commence further efforts of this nature 
in pursuing this strategy  we incur risks commonly encountered in connection with such a strategy  including losing the assistance of experienced personnel  compromising the loyalty of retained employees  incurring severance  pension  and other restructuring costs  diverting management resources to the implementation of restructurings and away from continuing operations  failing to maintain sufficient personnel to manage operational challenges  and failing to realize anticipated net cost reductions 
in addition  we have sought to efficiently budget our maintenance resources for our generating and delivery facilities 
if we underestimate required maintenance expenditures  we may run the risk of incurring an increased frequency of unplanned forced outages  which could ultimately lead to higher maintenance expenditures  increased operation at higher cost of previously marginal sources of in house generation  or requiring that we purchase power from third parties to meet our supply obligations  and we may experience t d reliability problems such as recurring outages  more significant effects from severe storms  and blackout situations 

table of contents risks related to our internal controls and procedures and to our business model transition our internal controls and procedures have been substantially deficient  and we remain in the process of correcting internal control deficiencies 
in august  allegheny and its independent auditors recognized that allegheny s internal controls and procedures had material weaknesses 
these material weaknesses led in part to the delay in the production of our audited financial statements for  which rendered us unable to comply with the sec s requirements with respect to the timely filing of our annual report 
we have not released quarterly financial statements  or filed required quarterly reports with the sec  for the third quarter of or for the first or second quarters of we will restate our financial statements for the first and second quarters of our independent auditors have advised us of material weaknesses noted during their audit of our financial statements 
for further information concerning allegheny s internal controls and procedures  see item controls and procedures and note to ae s consolidated financial statements 
if we cannot rectify these material weaknesses through remedial measures and improvements to our systems and procedures  management may encounter difficulties in timely assessing business performance and identifying incipient strategic and oversight issues 
where adequate automated control systems are not in place  we will need to devote personnel resources to account verification and reconciliation 
management is currently focused on remedying internal control deficiencies  and this focus will require management from time to time to devote its attention away from other planning  oversight  and performance functions 
we have applied substantial resources at all relevant managerial levels for approximately one year toward the task of improving our internal control environment 
these efforts  in which we have involved several external professional service firms  continue 
we cannot provide assurances as to the timing of the completion of these efforts or estimates of the prospective costs of these efforts  either in dollar terms or in the form of management attention 
we are substantially changing our business model and other aspects of our business  which subjects us to risks and uncertainties 
commencing in the second half of and continuing through  we have reassessed our position within the energy industry  the business environment  and our relative strengths and weaknesses 
in response  we have implemented substantial changes to our business model and other aspects of our business 
for example  we have reoriented our trading operations  reduced the size of our workforce  sold assets  exited markets and engaged in significant financing transactions  among other changes 
we have also made substantial changes to our senior management 
our circumstances in represented a substantial transformation from our historical integrated utility business model 
current and previous changes in our business model were prompted by internal decision making and by the changing regulatory and market environments 
we are in a state of transition  and additional changes to our business are being and will be  from time to time  considered as management seeks to restore our liquidity and place us on a sound strategic footing 
these transitions have been  and will be  unavoidably disruptive to our established organizational culture and systems 
in addition  consideration and planning of strategic changes focus management attention away from day to day execution 
there can be no assurance that we will ultimately be successful in transitioning our business model 

table of contents risks associated with competition the terms of ae supply s power sale agreements with the distribution companies could require ae supply to sell power below its costs or prevailing market prices or require the distribution companies to purchase power at a price above which they can sell power 
in connection with regulations governing the transition to market competition  west penn  monongahela with respect to its ohio customers  and potomac edison together  the plr companies are required to provide electricity at capped rates to retail customers who do not choose an alternate electricity generation supplier and to those who return to utility service from alternate suppliers 
the plr companies capped rates may be below current market rates through the transition periods 
we have structured our operations so that ae supply owns the generating assets that were previously owned by the plr companies 
the capped rates reflect the historical costs of operating and maintaining ae supply s generating assets 
the plr companies satisfy their plr obligations by sourcing power from ae supply under long term power sales agreements 
those agreements provide for the supply of a significant portion of the plr companies energy needs at the mandated capped rates with a specified remaining portion priced on the basis of market prices 
the amount of supply priced at market rates increases over each contract term 
power to be supplied by ae supply under these agreements amounts to the majority of ae supply s normal operating capacity 
for a detailed discussion of retail restructuring under state laws  see fuel  power and resource supply the delivery and services segment  and regulatory framework affecting allegheny state legislation and regulatory developments  below 
these power supply agreements present risks for both ae supply and the distribution companies 
at times  ae supply may not be able to earn as much as it otherwise could by selling power otherwise priced at capped rates into competitive wholesale markets 
conversely  the plr companies may at times pay market prices for a portion of their supply that exceed the amount they can charge retail customers for the power 
also  the demand for power required to meet the plr contract obligations could exceed ae supply s available generation capacity  which may require ae supply to buy power at prices that are higher than the sale price in the plr contracts 
although ae supply believes it currently owns or controls sufficient capacity to meet aggregate plr contract demand  there may intermittently occur periods of peak demand that exceed ae supply s available capacity 
these periods of peak demand often occur when the market price for power is very high 
a shortage of available capacity could be further exacerbated by sales of ae supply s generating assets used to hedge those contractual obligations 
should ae supply s cost of generation exceed the amounts to which it is entitled under the plr contracts  for example  due to fuel price increases and increased environmental compliance costs  ae supply would have to absorb the difference  absent regulatory relief 
similarly  if ae supply is required to purchase power to meet the plr obligations  it may not receive its marginal costs from the distribution companies 
even if ae supply can charge the distribution companies prices reflecting higher market prices  those companies might not be able to pass the costs on to their retail customers while state retail rate freezes remain in effect 
for a general discussion of market risks  see regulatory framework affecting allegheny state legislation and regulatory developments  below 
other risks associated with our business seasonal fluctuations pressure our facilities and operating results 
our business faces a number of risks that are common to the electric utility industry 
electrical power generation is generally a seasonal business 
in many parts of the country  demand for electricity peaks during the hot summer months  with market prices also peaking at that time 
in other areas  electricity demand peaks during the winter months 
during periods of peak demand  the capacity of our generating facilities may be inadequate 
also  our annual results may depend disproportionately on our performance during the winter and summer 
adverse weather conditions in and pressured our operating results in those years 

table of contents energy companies are subject to adverse publicity  which may render us vulnerable to negative regulatory and litigation outcomes 
the energy sector has been among the sectors of the economy that have been the subject of recent highly publicized allegations of misconduct 
adverse publicity of this nature may render legislatures  regulatory authorities  and tribunals less likely to view energy companies such as allegheny in a favorable light and may cause us to be susceptible to adverse outcomes with respect to decisions by such bodies 
the power outages that affected the northeast and midwest united states in august could exacerbate negative sentiment regarding the energy industry 
we are subject to risks related to the termination of competition transition periods 
ae supply s plr contracts last through the transition periods in each of the affected states 
as transition periods expire  generally  at varying periods over the next five years  ae supply may not be able to enter into similar arrangements due to changes in wholesale commodity prices and or ae supply s liquidity constraints 
this would result in future earnings and cash flow volatility for ae supply 
as the end of the transition periods draw closer in some states  consumer advocates and  in some cases  regulators have expressed concerns regarding consumers exposure to market conditions 
their concerns are based on the belief that competitive retail markets are not developing as expected  and customers will pay higher rates 
regulators or lawmakers could seek to address these concerns by extending the period during which the distribution companies are subject to capped rates for the provision of default service  which poses a risk to the distribution companies should the price paid for procuring default service after the originally established transition periods end exceed the capped rate during any extension 
the distribution companies are seeking to identify opportunities to enhance market development and minimize consumers concerns 
in maryland and ohio  these efforts have resulted in a plan to address post transition default service through a competitive bidding process  which has been approved by the maryland public service commission maryland psc 
a similar plan has been filed by the distribution companies in ohio  which is pending approval by the public utilities commission of ohio puco 
the distribution companies are also participating in state commission sponsored working groups in pennsylvania and virginia to develop a process for post transition default service 
for further discussion of these issues  see regulatory framework affecting allegheny state legislation and regulatory developments  below 
risks associated with regulation we are regulated under puhca  which constrains our ability to engage in financing transactions and asset sales and limits subsidiary dividends 
all of the allegheny companies are subject to regulation under puhca 
puhca limits the dividends that our subsidiaries may pay to us from undistributed surplus 
in addition  puhca requires that we obtain prior approval from the sec in order to raise financing  purchase or sell utility assets  or merge or consolidate with other companies 
these constraints could impede our ability to obtain financing in a timely manner  to obtain financing on favorable terms  or to pursue other business opportunities 
puhca also limits our range of business operations and ability to affiliate with other public utilities  such as by means of merger or acquisition 
shifting federal and state regulatory policies impose risks on our operating and capital structure 
regarding provision of power at wholesale and retail levels  respectively  the allegheny companies are regulated by both the ferc and state public service commissions 
as a result  we may be subject to conflicting regulatory policies that may adversely affect our ability to participate fully in competitive power markets 
moreover  these regulatory policies are continuing to evolve as a result of various legislative and regulatory initiatives regarding deregulation  regulation  or restructuring of the energy industry  including deregulation of 
table of contents the production and sales of electricity 
we may also see additional regulatory action taken by state or federal regulators as a result of the august  blackout 
any such new requirements could lead to increased operating expenses and capital expenditures  which cannot be predicted at this time 
recently  a number of states have moved away from electricity choice at the retail level by delaying the implementation of retail competition or rejecting it outright 
some states  including virginia  that have retail competition are informally contemplating re regulating retail markets 
however  we cannot predict to what extent these efforts will be successful  nor can we predict whether or to what extent they will be duplicated in other states 
thus  one of the most significant risks we face is choosing the correct business strategy to respond to these evolving policies 
allegheny believes that the previously approved transfer of certain generating assets to ae supply  which is a ferc regulated company  as well as allegheny s participation in pjm west  establishes significant impediments to state re regulation of ae supply s generation 
for a further discussion  see regulatory framework affecting allegheny federal regulation 
delays  discontinuations  or reversals of electricity market restructurings in the markets in which we operate  or may operate in the future  could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations and financial condition 
for example  the virginia general assembly enacted legislation in precluding incumbent electric utility companies such as potomac edison from transferring ownership or control of  or responsibility to operate  any portion of a transmission system located in virginia prior to july  the effect on potomac edison  which has already joined pjm  is unclear 
however  the legislation is expected to slow the entry of american electric power aep and dominion virginia power into pjm  which will hinder the expansion of the pjm market 
at a minimum  virginia s actions and similar actions by other states raise uncertainty concerning the continued development of competitive power markets 
given allegheny s multi state operations and asset base  re regulation of restructured obligations could prove intricate and time consuming and could lead to complications within allegheny s capital structure 
regulatorily mandated restructuring may increase our costs by preventing us from obtaining the full benefits of integrated utility operations 
changes to our corporate organization to comply with new ferc requirements could increase our administrative costs 
the success of our business depends  in part  on the economic efficiencies of integrated and coordinated utility operations among our electric transmission  distribution  wholesale marketing  and retail service businesses 
we have historically received benefits from operating in a vertically integrated manner  for example  by sharing administrative services and personnel among our businesses 
we are regulated by the ferc  which has adopted rules that require electric utilities to separate electric transmission from wholesale marketing activities 
the ferc requires employees with operational responsibility for transmission and reliability services to function independently from operating employees engaged in wholesale and unbundled retail generation service marketing activities 
the ferc currently permits senior officers and directors to have ultimate decision making authority for both electric transmission and wholesale marketing businesses 
the ferc has  however  proposed to require transmission operating employees to function independently 
if this proposal is implemented  we could be required to maintain duplicative management and administrative services 
we may be unable to take advantage of important financial incentives offered by regulators 
regulatory agencies sometimes provide utilities financial incentives to engage in favored activities and transactions 
for example  the ferc recently issued a proposed policy statement to provide financial incentives to utilities for the construction of new transmission facilities or to transfer control over their transmission systems to independent entities such as rtos 
although we believe that the distribution companies decision to transfer control over their transmission systems to pjm effective april  makes them eligible for the financial incentives the ferc is considering  we cannot predict whether they will actually receive these incentives or other incentives that may become available 
moreover  if we do receive such incentives  they may not be fully recoverable due to state retail rate freezes  or other factors 

table of contents we may realize reduced margins on our transmission operations relative to historical results due to our participation in pjm 
in order to comply with the ferc requirements designed to open access to transmission assets  we turned over functional control of our transmission facilities to pjm  via the pjm west arrangement  on april  our historical transmission margins exceeded the margins we would realize if we derived transmission facility revenue solely from the base open access tariff rates that pjm charges 
we have obtained the ferc s approval to collect surcharges to recover the difference in the near term  but it is possible that we may not fully recover our authorized surcharges for the duration of the transition period 
for a further discussion of the financial impact of our participation in pjm  see regulatory framework affecting allegheny federal legislation  competition  and rtos  below 
the ferc s efforts to create and expand large regional transmission organizations rtos provide both risks and opportunities for our business 
the ferc has strongly encouraged public utilities to join large rtos like pjm and has encouraged these entities to expand and to reduce or eliminate barriers to the trade of electricity with other rtos 
as part of this effort  the ferc has favored the elimination of charges for transmission service through  or out of  an rto  with the cost for service paid instead by customers in the rto where the power is consumed 
the purpose of this policy is to promote generation competition within and between rtos 
there can be no assurance  however  that the trend of regionalizing power distribution across larger geographic areas will continue 
there has been an ongoing debate regarding whether rtos improve or compromise grid reliability 
the power outages that affected the northeast and midwest in august have been cited by both sides in that debate 
the continued expansion of pjm presents the distribution companies with significant risks and opportunities 
incorporating new utilities like american electric power service corporation  dayton power and light company  and commonwealth edison company together  the new pjm companies into pjm may reduce the cost of transmission by eliminating the need to pay transmission charges to multiple utilities 
harmonizing scheduling practices and other tariff terms and conditions will reduce or eliminate non price barriers to competition across a broader region 
these changes may benefit the distribution companies by reducing the cost of buying power to serve their customers 
on the other hand  these changes may adversely affect the distribution companies recovery of their transmission cost of service due to the loss of their proportionate share of charges to export power from pjm 
effective when they joined pjm on april   the ferc allowed the distribution companies to recover the transmission revenues they lost through a transitional surcharge 
other parties who join pjm in the future may seek to alter  reduce  or eliminate this surcharge 
if they are successful  the distribution companies may be adversely affected 
for a further discussion  see regulatory framework affecting allegheny federal legislation  competition  and rtos  below 
in addition  expanding pjm may increase opportunities for ae supply to sell the output of its generation in new markets 
conversely  other generation owners may more economically compete for power sales in ae supply s traditional markets 
we are unable to predict whether we will be able to compete effectively as rtos expand and evolve 
we do not know whether markets will continue to be accessible  especially if some states choose to delay or repeal retail access programs 
it is also possible that inefficiencies may emerge as markets expand that may impair our ability to compete 
for a further discussion  see regulatory framework affecting allegheny federal legislation  competition  and rtos  below 
further  the expansion of pjm to include new companies may affect the cost of transmission service that allegheny requires in ways that are difficult to predict 
pjm uses a locational marginal pricing lmp method to price both generation and end use customer demand at a particular time and location on the electricity transmission network 
lmp recognizes that the marginal price of electricity may be different at different locations on the system and at different times 

table of contents differences in prices between two locations in the region at the same time reflect physical limitations in the transmission lines to move power across the system 
these limits are referred to as transmission congestion 
in concept  when there is enough transmission capacity to get power from the cheapest source of generation to all potential buyers on the system  there is no congestion and there would be only one price throughout the region 
when there is congestion  such as may occur on a hot summer day  the most economical generators may not be able to reach all of their potential buyers 
predicting when transmission congestion will occur  and how much of an impact it will have on prices  can be difficult 
the prediction is influenced by factors such as weather  transmission line or generator outages  and the transmission schedules of customers taking service from the rto and even utilities in neighboring regions 
end use customers using congested lines are required to pay congestion charges based on the difference of lmp at separate locations 
end use customers can manage the risk that the transmission system will be congested by requesting hedge contracts called financial transmission rights ftrs  which pay the contract holder the lmp difference between two pre selected points on the transmission system 
if the ftr holder accurately predicts the mw quantity of ftrs it will need along a particular transmission path  the payments it receives from the rto will offset the congestion charges it is required to pay to transmit power on that path 
ftrs are allocated by pjm at no cost to end use customers 
buyers of electricity must purchase ftrs from pjm  although buyers may be awarded ftrs if the buyer has paid for the construction of transmission facilities that increase the capacity of the system 
expanding pjm to include new utilities will bring new transmission lines and generators into the pjm region 
as a result  consumers in pjm will have access to new suppliers that may be less expensive than generators currently serving them  and transmitting power from these generators may cause power flows across the transmission system to change  which in turn could cause congestion on individual transmission lines to change potentially significantly from congestion patterns observed in the past 
to the extent we do not successfully predict these changes  we may not request the right amount of ftrs  which could increase our costs 
changes to rules relating to power plant construction could compromise the value of our generating assets under development or expansion 
the ferc recently issued a final rule on standardization of generator interconnection agreements and procedures 
in regional markets like pjm  the rule makes generators like ae supply responsible for the full cost of transmission system upgrades that would not have been necessary but for their interconnection 
generators may also receive certain ftrs that may defray the cost of network upgrades in whole or in part 
the rule also provides that new owners of a proposed generating project can succeed to the queue position in the transmission network upgrade study process held by the original project owner 
queue position means place in line 
pjm and other transmission providers normally study how new generators will impact the transmission system in the order of when each request was submitted  and queue position often influences interconnection rights and costs associated with transmission network upgrades 
the costs of any particular generating project could change substantially depending on what queue position the project holds 
certain parties have argued that upon the sale of a project  the new owner should be placed at the end of the transmission system impact study queue  potentially subjecting the project to increased interconnection costs 
the rule remains subject to requests for rehearing and continued appeals 
depending on the final outcome of the rule  ae supply s proposed facilities undergoing construction or upgrade could be adversely affected 

table of contents risks associated with the capital intensive nature of our business the capital intensive nature of our business exposes us to risks from natural catastrophes and terrorism 
much of the value of our business consists of our portfolio of unique fixed power generation and transmission assets 
our ability to conduct our operations depends on the integrity of these assets 
although we have taken and will continue to take reasonable precautions to safeguard these assets  there can be no assurance that they will not face damage or disruptions due to natural disasters 
in addition  in the current geopolitical climate  there is an enhanced concern regarding the risks of terrorism throughout the economy 
insurance coverage may not cover or may inadequately cover risks of this nature 
our facilities are subject to unplanned outages and significant maintenance requirements 
the operation of power generation  transmission  and distribution facilities involves many risks  including the breakdown or failure of electrical generating or other equipment  fuel interruption  and performance below expected levels of output or efficiency 
if our facilities operate below expectations  we may lose revenues or have increased expenses  including replacement power costs 
a significant portion of our facilities was originally constructed many years ago 
older equipment  even if maintained in accordance with good engineering practices  may require significant capital expenditures on our part to keep operating at peak efficiency or availability and is likely to require periodic upgrades and improvement 
risks related to legal proceedings we are involved in several important litigation proceedings that could result  individually or in the aggregate  in the imposition of significant cash awards against us or in impairment of the value of significant assets 
we are the object of several suits seeking substantial damage awards against us 
among these suits are shareholder and benefit plan participant suits  suits by california ratepayers and taxpayers  and a suit brought by merrill lynch and affiliated parties alleging breach of contract 
we are also involved in defending against claims for damages against us due to our alleged misconduct  and challenging the validity of various substantial power sales contracts 
further information regarding these legal proceedings  as well as other matters  is provided in item legal proceedings 
we may also be subject in the future to litigation based on asserted or unasserted claims 
we cannot predict the outcome of any of these proceedings or other matters  or of future litigation against us based on asserted or unasserted claims 
adverse outcomes in these proceedings and other matters  or in future litigation based on asserted or unasserted claims  could result in the imposition of substantial cash damage awards against us  in the decrease in the value of substantial assets  and the loss of sources of significant cash flow 
we are involved in shareholder suits and other litigation and are a subject of agency investigations in connection with our energy trading business 
in addition to litigation with merrill lynch  we are involved in other actions related to the energy trading business 
we are the target of putative class action suits by shareholders and by participants in our employee benefit plans that assert claims against us relating to our involvement in the energy trading business and to statements made by us concerning our business 
we are involved in arbitrations against terminated employees who were active in the energy trading business 
we have responded to subpoenas from the sec and commodity futures trading commission cftc directed to us 

table of contents our subsidiaries are and may become subject to legal claims arising from the presence of asbestos or other regulated substances at certain of our facilities 
the distribution companies have been named as defendants in pending asbestos litigation involving multiple plaintiffs and multiple defendants 
in addition  asbestos and other regulated substances are still present and may in the future continue to be located at allegheny owned facilities where suitable alternative materials are not available 
we believe  however  that any remaining asbestos at any given allegheny owned facility is contained 
allegheny believes that it uses and stores all hazardous substances in a safe and lawful manner 
however  asbestos and other hazardous substances are currently used and will continue to be used at allegheny owned facilities  which could result in actions being brought against ae supply that would claim exposure to asbestos or other hazardous substances 
a recent us supreme court decision could have the effect of increasing potential damage awards in asbestos suits 
additional discussion of the pending litigation appears in this report under item legal proceedings 
our borrowing facilities limit our ability to settle litigation 
covenants contained in the borrowing facilities restrict our ability to enter into litigation settlements in excess of million 
as a result  we may be required to proceed with litigation even if we would elect to attempt to settle matters in the absence of the restriction 
risk related to our reliance on other companies ae supply relies on power transmission facilities that it does not own or control 
if these facilities do not provide it with adequate transmission capacity  ae supply may not be able to deliver its wholesale electric power to its customers 
ae supply depends on some t d facilities owned and operated by both the distribution companies and other utilities and power companies to deliver the electricity it sells 
this dependence exposes ae supply to a variety of risks 
if transmission is disrupted or transmission capacity is inadequate  ae supply may not be able to sell and deliver all of its products 
if ae supply fails to schedule the delivery of electric energy correctly  it may face substantial penalties under the transmission provider s tariff 
if a region s power transmission infrastructure is inadequate  ae supply s recovery of costs and profits may be limited 
the ferc has proposed pricing structures to encourage the expansion of transmission infrastructure 
implementation of the proposed incentives is not assured  and no assurance can be given that the proposed incentives would serve as an adequate incentive to trigger significant investment in transmission network expansion 
if regulators unexpectedly adopt restrictive transmission price regulation  transmission companies may not have sufficient incentives to invest in the expansion of transmission infrastructure 
conversely  ae supply may suffer a competitive disadvantage if regulatory policies favor transmission expansion over generation expansion to alleviate grid congestion 
the power outages that occurred in the northeast  midwest  and in canada on august  could lead to further regulatory or legislative initiatives at the federal or state level regarding transmission and distribution reliability and expansion 
we are unable to predict the policies that may be pursued or the effect policy changes may have on the transmission of electricity 
ae supply and its customers depend upon access to the transmission grid to deliver electricity from generators to consumers 
if there is insufficient transmission capacity  or if transmitting utilities do not provide ae supply or its customers with fair and timely access to the transmission system  ae supply may lose opportunities to sell its products 
we cannot predict whether these circumstances will occur  or if they do  how significant the impact may be on ae supply 

table of contents risks associated with environmental regulation our costs to comply with environmental laws are significant  and the cost of compliance with future environmental laws could adversely affect our cash flow and profitability 
our operations are subject to extensive federal  state  and local environmental statutes  rules  and regulations relating to air quality  water quality  waste management  natural resources  site remediation  and health and safety 
compliance with these legal requirements requires us to commit significant capital toward environmental monitoring  installation of pollution control equipment  emission fees  and permits at all of our facilities 
these expenditures have been significant in the past and we expect that they will increase in the future 
costs of compliance with environmental regulations  particularly air emission regulations  could have a material adverse effect on our industry  our business  our results of operations  and financial condition 
this is especially true if emission limits are tightened  more extensive permitting requirements are imposed  additional substances become regulated  or the number and types of assets we operate increase 
we plan to incur substantial costs to install new emissions control equipment  and may be required to upgrade existing equipment  purchase emissions allowances  or reduce operations 
applicable standards under the epa s new source review nsr initiatives are in flux 
under the clean air act of clean air act  the modification of certain existing facilities rather than performance of routine maintenance could cause the facilities to be subject to far more stringent nsr standards applicable to new facilities 
the epa has taken the view that many companies  including many energy producers  have been modifying sources in connection with work believed by the companies to be routine maintenance under the statute and rules 
the epa and state agencies have successfully pursued nsr claims against energy producers and other companies and have required the expenditure of billions of dollars of emissions related capital upgrades as a result 
a recent judicial decision involving a subsidiary of firstenergy corporation could adversely affect industry wide environmental compliance costs 
a recent settlement agreement between the epa and dominion resources  inc also has adverse implications under nsr for the compliance costs of energy industry participants  such as allegheny 
however  the recent preliminary judicial decision in a case involving duke energy  and the final routine maintenance  repair and replacement rule rmrr recently released by the epa  are more consistent with the energy industry s historical compliance approach 
the epa has requested information from allegheny in connection with its nsr initiative 
most of our contracts with customers do not permit us to automatically recover additional capital and other costs incurred to comply with new environmental regulations 
as a result  to the extent these costs are incurred prior to the expiration of these contracts  these costs could adversely affect our financial performance 
risks inherent in the process of obtaining required environmental approvals could adversely affect our ability to operate current facilities or site future projects 
energy companies such as allegheny are subject to the risk that it may be difficult or impracticable to obtain or maintain all required environmental regulatory approvals 
if there is a delay in obtaining or renewing any required environmental regulatory approval or if we fail to obtain or comply with any such approval  the affected facilities could be delayed in becoming operational  could be temporarily closed  or otherwise subjected to capacity limitations  or subjected to additional costs 
further  at some of our older facilities  it may be uneconomical for us to install the necessary equipment  which may lead us to shut down or reduce the operations at certain individual generating units  resulting in a loss of capacity and possible significant environmental and other closure costs 
environmental and other regulations render it difficult and time consuming to site new generation and transmission and distribution projects 
future changes in environmental laws and regulations could cause us to incur significant costs or delays 
new environmental laws and regulations affecting our operations may be adopted  and new interpretations of existing laws and regulations could be adopted or become applicable to our facilities or us 
for example  the laws governing nitrogen oxides nox and sulfur dioxide nox emissions from coal burning plants could be 
table of contents interpreted by federal and state authorities in a manner that could subject some of our facilities to new source review under the clean air act and result in limitations on these emissions that are substantially more stringent than those currently in effect 
our compliance strategy  although reasonably based on the information available to us today  may not successfully address the relevant standards and interpretations of the future 
as a result  we may be required to materially increase all manner of our compliance expenditures or accelerate the timing of the capital portion of those expenditures 
the epa is developing new policies concerning protection of endangered species and sediment contamination  based on its interpretation of the clean water act cwa 
the scope and extent of any resulting environmental regulations and their effect on our operations is unknown 
the epa has also announced its intention to review rules related to the regulation of mercury emissions 
rules in this regard could have a material adverse effect on our ability to economically produce electricity from coal 
if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations  we may have to pay significant fines or incur significant capital expenditures 
if we fail to comply with environmental laws and regulations  even if caused by factors beyond our control  our failure may result in the assessment of civil or criminal liability  fines against us  and the need to expend significant  additional capital to comply 
recent lawsuits by the epa and various states highlight the environmental risks related to generating facilities  in general  and coal fired generating facilities  in particular 
for example  the attorneys general of new york and connecticut notified us in of their intent to commence civil actions against us for alleged violations of the clean air act or caaa 
if these actions were filed and if they were resolved against us  substantial modifications of our existing coal fired power plants would be required 
similar actions may be commenced by other governmental authorities in the future 
in addition  a number of our coal fired facilities have been the subject of a formal request for information from the epa concerning new source review requirements under the clean air act 
similar requests to other companies have often been followed by enforcement actions 
if an enforcement proceeding or litigation in connection with this request or in connection with any proceeding for non compliance with environmental laws were commenced and resolved against us  we could be required to invest significantly in new emission control equipment  accelerate the timing of capital expenditures  pay penalties  and or halt operations 
moreover  our results of operations and financial position could suffer due to the consequent distraction of management and the expense of ongoing litigation 
other parties have settled similar actions against them 
we could incur additional substantial liabilities for environmental remediation 
like other companies engaged in power generation  our operations involve the handling and use of hazardous materials and the generation of wastes 
a risk of environmental contamination is inherent in many of our activities  and we could be required to investigate and remediate properties in the event of a release to the environment or the discovery of contamination 
we are subject to certain environmental laws  such as the federal superfund law  that can impose liability for the entire cost of cleaning up a site  regardless of fault  upon certain statutorily defined parties 
these include current and former owners or operators of a contaminated site and companies that send wastes to a site that becomes contaminated 
many of our sites have been operated for a number of years and could require remediation in the future if contamination is discovered or if operations cease at a facility 
we may undertake future asset sales  including generating assets 
following a sale  we intend to transfer future environmental liability to the new owner 
however  it is possible that if future contamination occurs at these sites or is discovered from prior years operations  we might be required to participate in remediation efforts

table of contents the generation and marketing segment including monongahela s west virginia jurisdictional generating assets during and  the generation and marketing segment completed certain projects and also discontinued other planned projects 
recently completed projects springdale  pennsylvania 
ae supply completed construction of a mw combined cycle generating plant in springdale  pennsylvania  with a commercial operation date of july  this combined cycle facility includes two natural gas fired combustion turbines and one steam turbine 
buchanan county  virginia 
in june  ae supply completed construction and placed in service an mw simple cycle natural gas combustion turbine facility in buchanan county  virginia 
this facility is owned by buchanan generation  llc  an equal partnership of consol energy  inc  and buchanan energy company of virginia  llc  a wholly owned subsidiary of ae supply 
ae supply operates and dispatches percent of its generation 
harrison power station  west virginia 
during  generating capacity at harrison power station increased by mw  from  mw to  mw  due to efficiency upgrades of one of the steam turbines 
during  generating capacity at a second harrison unit increased by mw increasing the total station output to  mw 
these generation increases were based on initial steam turbine test results 
discontinued projects ae supply ceased construction or planning of several generating projects in  all in response to market conditions  including overcapacity and lower wholesale power prices  and to conserve liquidity 
the following are among the planned or commenced projects that were discontinued la paz county  arizona 
ae supply has decided not to construct a previously planned  mw natural gas fired generating facility in la paz county  arizona  for which it had previously acquired land and obtained arizona corporation commission approval 
st 
joseph county  indiana 
in january  ae supply announced plans to construct a mw natural gas fired merchant generating facility in st 
joseph county  indiana  approximately miles west of south bend 
ae supply suspended construction of this project in brooklyn navy yard barge 
ae supply has withdrawn from this mw barge mounted generating facility project and is seeking to terminate the agreement with its joint development partner 
rock springs  maryland 
ae supply has withdrawn from this simple cycle gas turbine project  in which it was a minority participant with an approximately mw ownership share in the  mw project 
see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations for additional information regarding charges for discontinued generating projects 
the delivery and services segment while meeting the ferc and certain state regulatory requirements  the distribution companies also must meet rto requirements since the responsibility for planning major transmission systems rests with the new independent authority 
the distribution companies do not expect their affiliation with pjm west to result in major near term system expansion 

table of contents electric facilities the following table shows allegheny s nominal maximum operational generating capacity as of december   based on said capacity of each unit 
all of the generating capacity is part of the generation and marketing segment owned by ae  ae supply  monongahela  or agc 
monongahela s owned capacity totaled  mw  of which  mw percent are coal fired and mw percent are pumped storage 
the term pumped storage refers to the bath county station  which stores energy for use principally during peak load hours by pumping water from a lower to an upper reservoir  generally during off peak hours 
during the generating cycle  power is produced by water falling from the upper to the lower reservoir through turbine generators 
ae supply s owned capacity including agc as of december   totaled  mw  of which  mw percent are coal fired   mw percent are natural gas fired  mw percent are pumped storage and hydroelectric  and mw percent are oil fired 
in may  ae supply completed the acquisition of three natural gas fired generating facilities in illinois  indiana  and tennessee 
the facilities have a total capacity of  mw 
as of december   ae supply had  mw of natural gas fired contracted capacity  as well as access to an additional mw of natural gas fired capacity through the hunlock creek facility  and three mw of hydroelectric capacity through green valley hydro  llc  a subsidiarary of ae green valley hydro 
as of january  ae supply had an additional mw of natural gas fired contracted capacity 
ae also holds a percent equity stake in and is a sponsoring company of ovec 
ovec is owned by electric utility companies  and its power participation benefits are afforded to approximately sponsoring companies 
currently  ae supply and monongahela have the benefits of a nine percent and a percent interest  respectively  in ovec 
they have an entitlement to capacity and energy in excess of certain ovec customer loads 
those loads currently are almost totally dormant 
as a consequence  nearly all of the ovec capacity and energy is surplus and ae supply and monongahela receive a combined percent share of that surplus  with individual apportionments of approximately mw and mw  respectively  for use toward supply requirements and other purposes 
power is supplied back to the sponsors under a contract that expires march  in july  ae supply completed construction of a mw combined cycle facility in springdale  pennsylvania 
the project is now in commercial operation 
in june  ae supply completed the sale of its mw share of the coal fired conemaugh generating station  located near johnstown  pennsylvania

in  almost percent of the coal received at these stations came from mines in west virginia  pennsylvania  maryland  illinois  and ohio 
none of the allegheny companies mine or clean any coal 
all raw  clean  or washed coal from suppliers is purchased as necessary to meet station requirements 
in  ae  ae supply  and monongahela had long term arrangements ie  terms of months or longer in place to purchase up to approximately million tons of coal 
allegheny purchases coal from a limited number of suppliers 
in  ae  ae supply and monongahela purchased approximately million tons of coal percent of coal used from various local mines owned by subsidiary companies of one coal company 
long term arrangements ie  terms of months or longer are in effect to provide for up to approximately million tons of coal in ae  monongahela  and ae supply will depend on short term arrangements and spot purchases for their remaining requirements 
for the year  the cost per equivalent ton of coal consumed was

this average cost per equivalent ton includes primary and auxiliary fuels 
the average cost increase resulted from a significant increase in market prices during which time a considerable portion of s fuel supply was purchased 

table of contents in  natural gas fired generation owned by ae and ae supply used approximately bcf of natural gas 
the natural gas was purchased either through long term natural gas supply agreements or in the spot market 
ae supply purchases natural gas services to supply its natural gas fired facilities  including agreements for transportation  storage  and supply  which allow ae supply to find the most economic options to serve its facilities 
ae supply currently has one index based natural gas supply agreement  which is in effect until may in addition  one of ae supply s subsidiaries has a month to month natural gas agreement in place

the delivery and services segment electric power allegheny substantially restructured its corporate organization in response to the electric utility deregulation within its service area between and the distribution companies  with the exception of monongahela with respect to its west virginia jurisdictional generating assets  do not produce their own power 
monongahela transferred a portion of its generating assets relative to its ohio and ferc jurisdictional generating assets  including a portion of its ownership interest in agc and ovec  to ae supply in in  potomac edison transferred substantially all of its generating assets to ae supply 
west penn transferred all of its generating assets to ae supply in the distribution companies generation asset transfers included  in the case of potomac edison and west penn  entitlement to ovec capacity and their entire ownership interest in agc 
the distribution companies retain the obligation to provide electricity to customers who do not retain an alternate electricity generation supplier during the deregulation transition period 
the transition periods vary across allegheny s service area and by state 
monongahela 
in ohio  the transition period for residential and small business customers ends on december  the transition period ceases for all other ohio customers at the end of potomac edison 
in maryland  the transition period for residential customers ends december  the transition period ends december   for commercial and industrial customers 
in virginia  the transition period continues until july  west penn 
the pennsylvania transition period terminates at the end of for all customers 
these transition periods could be altered by legislative or  in some cases  regulatory actions 
ae supply has the contractual obligation to provide power to the distribution companies during the current relevant state deregulation transition periods under the terms of power supply agreements with the distribution companies 
ae supply also leases generating capacity to potomac edison to serve customers in potomac edison s west virginia service territory 
sales under the power sales agreements ae supply has with west penn  monongahela with respect to its ohio customers and potomac edison currently consume a majority of the normal operating capacity of ae supply s generating assets that were previously owned by the distribution companies 
these agreements have a fixed price as well as a market based pricing component 
these components may have little or no relationship to the cost of supplying this power 
this means that ae supply currently absorbs a portion of the risk of fuel price increases and increased costs of environmental compliance since ae supply is unable to automatically pass on such costs to the distribution companies 
the distribution companies purchase power from ae supply to satisfy their respective plr obligations 
the purchases are made under the terms of power sales agreements with ae supply which will terminate as set 
table of contents forth in the chart below 
when these agreements terminate  the distribution companies will be unable to rely on a dedicated supply of power from ae supply at the current contract prices to meet their respective power supply requirements 
the arrangements to serve the load of the distribution companies have not been determined and are subject to legislative and regulatory actions within the states of pennsylvania and virginia 
in maryland  settlement negotiations regarding the provision of default service in the post transition period have concluded and have resulted in a settlement agreement that prescribes a wholesale bidding process to procure market based full requirements service for end use customers 
a final state commission order on this settlement is expected in late september  with the bid solicitation process beginning october  with respect to ohio  monongahela is undertaking a wholesale bidding process  similar to that in maryland  to procure market based full requirements service for industrial and commercial end use customers  beginning january   for eligible customers 
however  contract awards and the subsequent retail rates are subject to state regulatory approval 
a portion of the plr obligations for the distribution companies is satisfied by purpa contract purchases

natural gas supply monongahela s regulated natural gas sales operations are carried out through mountaineer and its monongahela divisions 
west virginia is in the path of major natural gas supply routes from the gulf of mexico to the northeast  and monongahela has direct access to the columbia gas transmission corporation columbia gas and the tennessee gas pipeline tennessee interstate pipeline systems 
monongahela s principal natural gas requirements are supplied from wells located in appalachia and the gulf of mexico producing basins 
monongahela s ownership of mgs provides direct access to a portion of monongahela s total annual natural gas needs less than percent 
a small part of mgs output is sold to third parties 
approximately percent of monongahela s natural gas supply requirements are purchased on a forward basis up to months  with the remainder  including mgs production  purchased on a one year or more forward basis 
the current price of natural gas is high in relation to historical prices  and monongahela has sought to satisfy supply requirements under relatively short term arrangements

however  liquidity issues have resulted in monongahela being denied by a number of its former suppliers of the ability to purchase any volumes on a forward basis 
natural gas transportation and storage capacity natural gas purchased from producers or suppliers in the gulf coast producing basin region is transported through the interstate pipeline systems of columbia gulf and columbia gas to monongahela s local distribution facilities in west virginia 
to ensure continuous  uninterrupted service to its customers  mountaineer has in place long term transportation and storage service agreements with columbia gas and columbia gulf 
these contracts cover a wide range of transportation services and volumes  ranging from firm transportation service to no notice service and storage with such contracts expiring on october  mountaineer has the right to renew its contracts under right of first refusal procedures set forth in the pipeline companies tariffs 
under both mountaineer s and wvp s purchased gas adjustment clauses pga  purchased gas costs including transportation and storage services  if prudently incurred  are recovered from the respective companies customers 
typically  large commercial and industrial end users of natural gas use natural gas sales and or transportation contracts for load management purposes 
under such contracts  these users purchase and or transport natural gas with the understanding that they may be forced to shut down their use of natural gas or 
table of contents switch to alternate sources of energy during times when the natural gas is needed for higher priority customers of the utility serving the end user such as schools and hospitals  or interruptible transportation on the transporting pipeline is curtailed limited restricted 
in addition  during times of extraordinary supply problems  curtailments of deliveries to these classes of customers typically large industrial customers with firm interstate transportation contracts may be necessary  but only in accordance with guidelines established by appropriate federal and state regulatory agencies 
since july  mountaineer has served many of these types of customers  some of which are capable of using alternate fuels as an energy source at their respective facilities 
in  mountaineer did not have to interrupt these customers because of supply or transportation capacity scarcity or curtailments 
rate matters monongahela on october   the west virginia psc approved an interim decrease in the pga rate for natural gas customers of monongahela  effective with bills rendered on and after december  through november  total revenue decrease for the month period of million or percent 
this approval became final on december  the reduced pga rate is the result of changes in the market price monongahela pays for natural gas 
this decrease in natural gas cost recovery revenues has no effect on earnings because it was implemented via the pga mechanism 
under the pga mechanism  differences between revenues received for energy costs and actual energy costs are deferred until the next annual pga proceeding when energy rates are adjusted to return or recover previous overrecoveries or underrecoveries  respectively 
on october   the west virginia psc approved an interim decrease in the pga rate for natural gas customers of monongahela  effective with bills rendered on or after december  this interim decrease was primarily due to previous overrecoveries 
on march   the west virginia psc issued a recommended decision approving revised rates as filed total estimated annual revenue decrease over the pga of million or percent 
higher natural gas market prices occurred this winter as a result of a combination of factors increased demand  resulting from colder than normal temperatures  increased industrial demand  lower natural gas storage levels  and a downturn in natural gas directed drilling activity in the decrease in pga rates resulted from previous overrecoveries  which more than offset the increase in natural gas costs 
the revised rates became effective with bills rendered on or after may  on october   the west virginia psc approved an interim decrease in the pga rate for mountaineer customers  effective with bills rendered on or after december  this interim decrease resulted from refunding of previous overrecoveries  partially offset by minor increases in the wholesale commodity prices 
on march   the west virginia psc issued a recommended decision approving revised increased rates submitted in a settlement agreement filed on january  total annual revenue increase over the pga of million or percent 
as stated in the preceding paragraph  higher natural gas market prices occurred this winter as a result of a number of factors 
the revised rates became effective with bills rendered on or after april  the decision became final on april  on august   monongahela and mountaineer gas filed for pga rate increases of percent and percent respectively  to be effective for a month period beginning with service rendered on and after november  the increased pga rates are the result of increased market prices monongahela and mountaineer pay for natural gas and the removal of a credit for a previously deferred balance 
a stipulation was approved on september  reflecting interim pga rate increases over the final rates approved for the pga period of percent and percent for monongahela and mountaineer gas  respectively  to be effective with service rendered on and after october  the west virginia psc ordered that a final decision be issued by march  
table of contents on january   the west virginia psc issued an order granting movement of wvp electric customers to monongahela tariffs  effective january  this order is in compliance with the west virginia psc s directive  issued in a december  order  to move all former wvp customers to the monongahela tariff in january the movement of customers results in an overall decrease in revenue to monongahela of approximately million per year 
although most of the former wvp customers received rate decreases  there is a small percentage of customers who will incur rate increases  and provisions have been made to address the gradual move to monongahela rates for this selected group of customers 
monongahela has been ordered to not apply the three percent temporary customer choice credit  provided in its tariff  to former wvp medium and large sized commercial and industrial customers 
monongahela will allocate the monies generated by non application of the temporary customer choice credit to a fund that will be used by monongahela to moderate the effect of the rate increases that will result from the movement of former wvp customers to monongahela s tariff  so that no customer will receive a rate increase greater than seven percent a year 
potomac edison on november   the maryland psc approved the power sales agreement between potomac edison and ae supply  the winning bidder  covering the sale of the aes warrior run output to the wholesale market for the period january   through december  the aes warrior run cogeneration project was developed under purpa and achieved commercial operation on february  under the terms of the maryland deregulation plan approved in  the revenues from the sale of the aes warrior run output are used to offset the capacity and energy costs that potomac edison pays to the aes warrior run cogeneration project before determining amounts to be recovered from maryland customers 
effective with bills rendered on or after january   there was a decrease in distribution rates for maryland customers 
this decrease or customer choice credit is a result of implementing the rate reductions called for by a settlement agreement approved by the maryland psc in december the customer choice credit will remain in effect until a total of million approximately million annually has been credited to residential customers and a total of million approximately million annually has been credited to commercial and industrial customers 
additionally  since the time the maryland psc approved the rate reductions outlined above  the environmental surcharge has increased  and an electric universal service surcharge has been introduced  both of which must be recovered under potomac edison s distribution rate cap 
accordingly  distribution rates have been further reduced by million from the previously approved rates 
the distribution rate cap for all customers is effective from through west penn the pennsylvania department of revenue increased the gross receipts tax rate from percent to percent for electric distribution companies in the state  including west penn 
the new rate was effective january  on august   the pennsylvania public utility commission pennsylvania puc approved west penn s request to recover these increased tax charges by means of a state tax adjustment surcharge stas added to customers bills 
on december   the pennsylvania puc approved west penn s request to include the previously approved surcharge in west penn s base rate for its tax liability  effective january  in  pennsylvania also reduced the series of rate reductions in the capital stock and franchise tax also recovered via stas 
for the year  the capital stock and franchise tax was increased to mills from mills  resulting in additional tax expense of approximately million 
on july   west penn filed a petition to reflect the change and to continue to defer the stas underrecovery as a regulatory asset for future recovery 
the pennsylvania puc allowed west penn to defer the amount of its stas undercollection 
agc agc s rates are set by a formula filed with and previously accepted by the ferc 
under this formula  the only component that can change is the return on equity roe 
pursuant to a settlement agreement filed with the ferc on april   agc s roe was set at percent for and will continue at that rate until the time any affected party requests and the ferc grants a change 
no party has requested any change 

table of contents regulatory framework affecting allegheny the interstate transmission services and wholesale power sales of the distribution companies and ae supply are regulated by the ferc under the federal power act fpa 
the distribution companies local distribution service and sales at the retail level are subject to state regulation 
the statutory and regulatory framework affecting these companies has evolved significantly over the past decade  and these changes have exposed the companies to significant new risks and opportunities 
ae and all of its subsidiaries are also subject to the broad jurisdiction of the sec under puhca 
the distribution companies are regulated as to substantially all of their operations by regulatory commissions in the states in which they operate 
in addition  allegheny s communications subsidiary  acc  is subject  to a limited extent  to the jurisdiction of the federal communications commission and state communications regulatory commissions 
allegheny is subject to numerous other local  state  and federal laws  regulations  and rules 
federal regulation federal legislation  competition  and rtos the fpa gives the ferc broad authority to regulate public utilities such as ae supply and the distribution companies that own or operate facilities used for the transmission or sale at wholesale of electric power in interstate commerce 
under the fpa  the ferc regulates the rates  terms  and conditions of wholesale power sales and transmission services offered by public utilities  among other things 
historically  the ferc used cost of service regulation to determine whether utility rates satisfied the fpa s just and reasonable standard 
in the late s  however  the ferc began to allow firms engaged in wholesale power sales to sell at negotiated prices  which led to the development of competitive power markets 
the national energy policy act of epact provided significant incentives for the restructuring of the electric utility industry to promote competition in wholesale power sales by giving the ferc new authority to order electric utilities to provide third parties with access to their transmission systems and by encouraging investments in exempt wholesale generators ewg that engage exclusively in wholesale power sales 
in  the ferc issued order no 
to promote electric competition by requiring all public utilities operating interstate transmission facilities to file non discriminatory open access transmission tariffs  and offer wholesale power sales and transmission services as separate products 
order no 
also required public utilities to take transmission service under the same open access tariff as their customers  to state separate rates for wholesale generation  transmission  and ancillary services  and when making wholesale power sales  to rely on the same electronic information network that their transmission customers rely on to obtain information about the utility transmission system 
order no 
 which was issued at the same time as order no 
 imposed standards of conduct governing communications between the utility transmission and wholesale power service groups to prevent utilities from giving their power marketing arms preferential access to transmission system information 
order no 
also required utilities to establish electronic communication networks  called oasis  to provide existing and potential customers the same access to transmission information as the utilities power marketing groups 
public utilities nationwide  including the distribution companies  responded to the ferc s requirements in order nos 
and by filing open access transmission tariffs and separating their wholesale power sales businesses from their transmission businesses 
a number of states  including maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  and virginia  adopted retail access legislation which permitted utilities to transfer their generating assets to affiliated companies or third parties 
similar to many other utilities  the distribution companies restructured their businesses between and in maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  and virginia to comply with retail restructuring requirements in those states by  among other things  transferring generating assets serving 
table of contents customers in those states to ae supply 
according to the ferc  market restructuring  both regionally and nationally  contributed to a threefold increase in wholesale power market trading activity during the s 
for a further discussion  see state legislation and regulatory developments  below 
in december  the ferc issued order no 
to promote the further development of wholesale market competition 
order no 
encouraged all public utilities that own or operate jurisdictional transmission assets to voluntarily transfer control over their transmission assets to rtos and required the utilities to file detailed plans to do so 
on march   the distribution companies filed a plan with the ferc to transfer functional control over their transmission system to pjm 
the plan was approved by the ferc on january   and the distribution companies became members of pjm effective april  on july   the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking which would address the ferc s lingering concerns about alleged unduly discriminatory practices in the energy industry by requiring transmission owning public utilities to offer standardized flexible transmission service and to create a level playing field for all participants in wholesale power markets 
the rule proposes  among other things  to make participation in rtos also called independent transmission providers itps in the proposed rule mandatory  rather than voluntary as under order no 
 to require itps to administer day ahead and real time spot energy markets  to establish market based methods to manage transmission congestion using locational marginal pricing  to establish procedures to ensure the long term adequacy of transmission  generation  and demand side resources  and to establish procedures to monitor and mitigate the abuse of market power in competitive wholesale markets 
the proposed rule s most controversial features include the ferc s claim to have jurisdiction over the transmission component of utility bundled retail power sales  the proposed requirement that all public utilities join itps by a certain date  and its proposal that service to retail customers should not receive a preference over other users of the transmission system 
hundreds of comments were filed with the ferc in response to its proposed rule  with some supporting various features of the rule and others opposing the proposed changes 
allegheny filed comments which were generally supportive  but suggested certain improvements to the rule 
on april   the ferc issued a white paper called the wholesale power market platform in response to the comments 
the white paper indicates the ferc s willingness to make certain modifications to the proposed rule  most notably to allow greater flexibility in the timing of when public utilities must join itps  and to give states a greater role in planning new transmission system expansions and how the costs will be recovered 
there is some uncertainty whether congress will permit the proposed rule to take effect 
the energy policy act of as passed by the us house of representatives contains a provision that would require the ferc to delay implementation of the proposed rule changes until the senate passed a bill that does not include this condition  and both bills are now in conference with final action expected this fall 
for a further discussion  see federal initiatives  below 
important developments over the past three years have significantly influenced the legislative and policy initiatives discussed above 
beginning in the summer of  unusual weather  supply imbalances  fuel price increases  market imperfections  and allegations of improper trading practices by some market participants contributed to extreme price increases and volatility in california s wholesale power markets 
these circumstances eventually unsettled power markets throughout the western united states and triggered numerous legal proceedings at the ferc  at the state level  and before congress 
similar  though less dramatic  price volatility affected power markets in the east  including pjm  new york  and new england 
markets responded to these price increases by increasing generating capacity through new construction and delayed plant retirements 
in  markets returned to historically normal price ranges as the economy slowed  generating capacity increased  fuel prices fell  and demand declined 
the changing market pressured many wholesale power trading firms when market prices fell below forecasts  resulting in reduced revenues  declining credit quality and  
table of contents ultimately  a decline in wholesale market trading activity 
some firms responded by curtailing trading activities or exiting the market altogether 
enron s bankruptcy in the fall of and disclosures concerning its trading practices contributed to concerns by regulators and market participants that wholesale power markets had serious flaws that needed to be addressed 
investigations in by the ferc  cftc  and department of justice doj of so called round trip trading practices at certain companies  followed by several additional utility bankruptcy petitions in  have further contributed to this perception 
in the past year  a number of states have moved away from electricity choice at the retail level by delaying the implementation of retail competition or rejecting it outright 
some states that have retail competition  including virginia  are considering re regulating retail markets 
allegheny cannot predict to what extent these efforts will be successful  nor can it predict whether or to what extent they will be duplicated in other states 
as the foregoing discussion indicates  changes to date with respect to electric competition have significantly affected the nature of the electric industry and the manner in which its participants conduct their business 
these changes make it very difficult to develop a long term business model 
delays  discontinuations  or reversals of electricity market restructurings in the markets in which the distribution companies  ae supply  and their affiliates operate  or may operate in the future  could have a material adverse effect on their results of operations and financial condition 
puhca puhca  originally enacted in and as subsequently amended  imposes financial and operational conditions and restrictions on many aspects of a registered holding company system s business 
puhca restricts a registered holding company system from expanding into other businesses by prohibiting it from engaging in activities that are not functionally related to its core business and also requires registered holding company systems to confine themselves to a single integrated public utility system 
most importantly  in light of allegheny s liquidity issues  puhca requires pre approval from the sec for  among other things  the issuance of debt or equity securities  and for the sale or acquisition of utility assets 
the puhca approval process introduces significant lead times into routine transactions under normal circumstances 
lead times to obtain authorizations can be from six to nine months 
the sec  in certain matters  also requires state approvals as a condition to authorizations  even though such approvals might not be required under applicable state laws 
in certain instances  such as transactions involving designations of assets as ewgs which exempts the designated assets from continuing puhca jurisdiction  the sec has expanded the jurisdiction of state commissions by requiring that the applicant company obtain a letter from each state in which any of its affiliates operates certifying that state s approval 
this introduces further lead times and uncertainties into the transaction planning process 
many of allegheny s competitors are not regulated under puhca and  therefore  do not face such constraints 
additionally  under puhca  the sec has imposed debt to equity ratios on jurisdictional utilities  thus imposing additional operating constraints not imposed on non jurisdictional utilities 
allegheny s current equity ratio is below the level required under its current financing authorizations  and this circumstance has required us to obtain additional authorizations 
purpa under purpa  electric utility companies such as the distribution companies are required to interconnect with  provide back up electric service to  and purchase electric capacity and energy from qualifying small power production and cogeneration facilities that satisfy the eligibility requirements for purpa benefits established by the ferc 
the rates to be paid for electric energy purchased from such qualifying facilities are established by the appropriate state public service commission or legislature 

table of contents the distribution companies have committed to purchase mw of qualifying purpa capacity 
payments for purpa capacity and energy pursuant to these contracts in totaled approximately million  before amortization of west penn s adverse power purchase commitment 
the average cost to the distribution companies of these power purchases was cents kwh 
the distribution companies are currently authorized to recover substantially all of these costs in their retail rates 
it is possible that the distribution companies obligations to purchase power from qualified purpa projects in the future may exceed amounts they are authorized to recover from their customers  which could result in losses related to the purpa contracts 
federal initiatives congress did not enact any significant energy related legislation in in  the house and senate passed their versions of an energy bill 
a house senate conference to reconcile the two bills has begun and is planned to conclude this fall with a compromise bill being reported back to both chambers for approval 
if passed  the legislation would then go to the president to be signed into law 
both bills currently include provisions repealing puhca  allegheny s chief legislative issue  however  under the pending legislation  the subject matter of many aspects of the sec s authority over subject companies would be transferred to the ferc 
allegheny continues to advocate the repeal of puhca and section of purpa on the grounds that these statutes are obsolete and anticompetitive  and that purpa results in utility customers paying above market prices for power 
state legislation and regulatory developments maryland maryland s adoption of electric industry restructuring legislation in gave potomac edison s maryland retail electric customers the right to choose their electricity generation suppliers

ae supply is not actively marketing to retail customers in maryland at this time 
the maryland psc in issued a restrictive order imposing standards of conduct for transactions between maryland utilities and their affiliates 
among other things  the order restricted sharing of utility employees with affiliates and announced the maryland psc s intent to consider the imposition of a royalty fee to compensate the utility for the use by an affiliate of the utility s name and or logo and for other intangible or unquantified benefits 
potomac edison  along with substantially all of maryland s natural gas and electric utilities  filed a petition for judicial review of the restrictive order 
after a series of judicial and legislative actions  the maryland psc s order was reversed on procedural grounds 
potomac edison and the other maryland natural gas and electric utilities believe that the maryland psc s previous  less restrictive code of conduct is currently in effect in maryland pending further maryland psc action 
this code of conduct is similar to those adopted in other jurisdictions and should not create operational constraints 
on august   the maryland psc began a process of soliciting comments on a new code of conduct proposal 

table of contents in december  the maryland psc directed electric utilities and interested parties to commence meetings on the status of the provision of default service following the expiration of the various electric companies transition periods 
as a result of these discussions  the parties  with one exception  filed a settlement agreement with the maryland psc  which has been approved 
as a result  potomac edison will provide plr service or standard offer service  to residential customers through december   and provide standard offer service to other commercial and industrial customers for various periods running as late as december  wholesale electric supply services necessary to serve these loads after the expiration of the transition period and before the expiration of the settlement period would be procured through a competitive bid process 
potomac edison would be allowed to recover its costs for the services through an administrative charge  including a rate of return and taxes

the hearing examiner issued a proposed order in favor of eastalco 
potomac edison commenced an appeal of the proposed order 
on march   potomac edison and eastalco jointly filed an amendment to their electric service agreement with the maryland psc which was accepted  resolving the dispute

potomac edison s transfer of operational control over its transmission facilities to pjm was approved by the ferc on january   and became effective on april  ae supply did not renew its virginia competitive retail electric service provider s license and allowed it to expire in ae supply had no virginia retail customers in 
table of contents west virginia in march  the west virginia legislature passed legislation directing the west virginia psc to determine whether retail electric competition was in the best interests of west virginia and its citizens 
the west virginia psc opened a case to investigate retail competition  and submitted an electric restructuring plan to the legislature for approval 
the plan would have introduced full retail competition on january  the legislature approved the plan but withheld implementation until necessary tax modifications were implemented 
the tax modifications were never enacted and the west virginia psc has dismissed the electric restructuring proceeding 
in may  potomac edison and monongahela filed an application to transfer their west virginia generating assets to ae supply  which the west virginia psc approved for potomac edison and requested that monongahela file a separate petition

ae supply manages all of its generating assets as an integrated portfolio with its risk management  wholesale marketing  fuel procurement  and asset optimization activities 
in  allegheny joined pjm west  and ae supply reoriented its focus to its core generation business 
ae supply reduced its trading operations and  in  moved its trading operations from new york to monroeville  pennsylvania 
ae supply is seeking to concentrate activities to hold positions in support of its generating assets in regions and markets where it has a generating presence 
ae supply is also marketing selected  non core assets  primarily located outside of the pjm market  including  among other things  the sale of the cdwr contract and associated hedges mentioned below  with a view to generating cash for the reduction of debt 
ae supply s focus on being a regional  asset backed market participant will position allegheny to compete more effectively in the changing energy markets 
refocusing on its core physical asset base will enable ae supply to take maximum advantage of its substantial physical presence  operational expertise  and knowledge of regional markets 
however  ae and ae supply s liquidity positions have rendered portfolio rebalancing difficult  and no assurance can be given that the intended rebalancing will occur 
selling and or unwinding non core trading positions will reduce current and follow on collateral obligations  thereby enhancing ae supply s ongoing working capital position 
however  ae supply s ability to exit such non core trading positions is subject to allegheny s liquidity position  and no assurance can be given that this strategy can be executed in a timely fashion 
long term power sales agreements plr contracts 
pursuant to long term power sales agreements  ae supply provides the distribution companies with generation service during retail competition transition periods in pennsylvania  maryland  ohio  and virginia 
under these agreements  ae supply provides the distribution companies with the amount of electricity  up to their plr retail load and  in certain instances  wholesale load obligations  which they may demand during the transition periods in their states 
these agreements under peak load conditions represent a significant portion of the normal operating capacity of ae supply s generating assets that were previously owned by monongahela  potomac edison  and west penn 
ae supply s power sales agreements with west penn and monongahela  with respect to its ohio customers  and potomac edison with respect to its maryland and virginia customers have a fixed price  as well as a market based pricing component 
as the amount of electricity ae supply must deliver under these agreements at fixed rates decreases during the transition periods described above  the amount of electricity that is subject to market prices escalates each year 
the transition to market prices will be phased in for the distribution companies at different times through  depending upon the state and the customer class 
exelon toll

as noted below  allegheny has terminated certain of these transactions and is evaluating the potential to unwind certain of the remaining commitments 
dominion transmission transportation contract 
ae supply has a long term agreement with dominion transmission  inc  for the transportation of natural gas starting june   under a tariff approved by the ferc 
this agreement provides for the firm transportation of  mmbtu of natural gas per day through may   from oakford  westmoreland county  pennsylvania to springdale  pennsylvania 
this transportation agreement was purchased for natural gas deliveries at ae supply s new combined cycle plant in springdale  pennsylvania 

table of contents equitable gas transportation contract 
ae supply has a long term agreement with equitable gas company  a division of equitable resources  inc  for the transportation of natural gas  starting march   under a tariff approved by the ferc 
this agreement provides for firm transportation of  mmbtu of natural gas per day through december   from equitable gas company greene county  pennsylvania to hatfield s ferry power station 
this transportation agreement was purchased for anticipated natural gas deliveries associated with natural gas reburn opportunities at the hatfield s ferry power station in pennsylvania 
natural gas reburn provides another alternative for ae supply to reduce nox emissions at hatfield s ferry power station by using natural gas  when economical relative to other no x management activities  instead of coal for a portion of the generating station s anticipated fuel requirements 
williams toll 
ae supply and williams were parties to a tolling agreement under which ae supply had a long term contractual right to call on a daily basis up to  mw of natural gas fired generating capacity in california through may monthly fixed price capacity payments were to be made to williams for these contractual rights 
when ae supply exercised these contractual rights  additional payments were to be made to williams based on predetermined natural gas to electricity conversion rates 
the tolling agreement with williams was purchased as part of ae supply s acquisition of the energy trading business from merrill lynch in march in july  ae supply entered into a conditional agreement with williams to terminate the tolling agreement 
under the agreement  ae supply made an initial payment to williams of approximately million to satisfy certain amounts under a related hedge agreement 
under the terms of the termination agreement  allegheny paid to williams million on september  after the closing of its sale of the cdwr contract 
allegheny is also required to make two payments of million to williams  in march and september of the tolling agreement will terminate when the final million payment is made 
lv cogen toll 
in may  ae supply entered into a year agreement with lv cogen to control mw of generation capacity from a natural gas fired  combined cycle generating facility in las vegas  nevada 
this facility began operation in january the tolling agreement with lv cogen was entered into to complement ae supply s overall position in the western united states 
in august  ae supply entered into an agreement to terminate its tolling agreement with lv cogen 
under the agreement  allegheny made a million payment to the lv cogen on september  after the closing of its sale of the cdwr contract 
el paso transportation contract 
ae supply currently has a long term agreement with el paso natural gas company el paso for the transportation of natural gas that began june   under tariffs approved by the ferc 
this agreement provides for the firm transportation of gas from western texas and northern new mexico to the southern california border and was purchased for anticipated natural gas deliveries at the lapaz combined cycle generating facility in arizona  a project which has since been cancelled by ae supply 
ae supply has released this capacity to a third party on a short term basis  for which it is receiving payments to partially offset the remaining capacity charges 
kern river transportation contract 
ae supply has a long term agreement with kern river for the transportation of natural gas  starting may   under a tariff approved by the ferc 
this agreement provides for firm transportation of  mcf of natural gas per day through april   from opal  wyoming  to southern california 
this transportation agreement was purchased for anticipated natural gas deliveries into southern california and at the lv cogen combined cycle generating facility in nevada 

table of contents the delivery and services segment distribution companies retail access all of the distribution companies ohio  maryland  pennsylvania  and virginia customers have the ability to choose their electricity generation suppliers 
in  approximately percent  percent  and percent of monongahela  potomac edison  and west penn s respective regulated customer base were customers of competing electricity generation suppliers 
the corresponding percentages in were approximately percent  percent  and percent for monongahela  potomac edison  and west penn  respectively 
the distribution companies recognize revenue from power transmission in addition to distribution 
to the extent a competitor supplies power along the transmission grid of a distribution company  the distribution company will assess a delivery charge 
the distribution companies have ceded operational control over their transmission assets to pjm 
it is not expected that this change in control will adversely affect grid reliability or lead to short term increases in capital expenditures related to transmission assets 
pjm s control of the grid is intended to limit or eliminate pricing advantages related to grid control 
participation in rtos on march   the distribution companies proposed to comply with the ferc s requirement in order by joining pjm through the pjm west arrangement 
the filing represented a collaboration between the distribution companies  pjm  and numerous stakeholders 
the distribution companies and pjm asked the ferc to confirm that pjm west satisfies the ferc s requirements for an rto as set forth in order for a further discussion  see regulatory framework affecting allegheny federal initiatives  above 
the distribution companies also asked the ferc to accept certain transmission rate surcharges so that the distribution companies would not suffer a loss in revenues when pjm west became operational and to recover certain pjm west start up costs 
this included a transmission revenue neutrality charge  which allows the distribution companies to collect million of revenues through that would otherwise have been lost as a result of joining pjm  as well as start up costs associated with the integration of the distribution companies into the pjm market 
collection of the revenue neutrality charge and start up costs will continue until such time as the full million has been recovered 
the distribution companies also adopted pjm s transmission pricing methodology  including pjm s congestion management system 
in addition  pjm expanded its day ahead and real time energy markets to include pjm west 
as a result  energy suppliers are now able to reach consumers anywhere within the expanded pjm pjm west market at a single transmission rate under the pjm open access tariff 
on january   the ferc authorized the distribution companies and pjm to proceed with pjm west 
on april   the distribution companies turned functional control of their transmission facilities over to pjm  via the pjm west arrangement 
the ferc subsequently issued an order accepting the distribution companies offer of settlement on july   which resolved all issues concerning the distribution companies revenue neutrality surcharge 
accordingly  the distribution companies are authorized to recover the revenue neutrality surcharge as described above 
the pjm west region is continuing to expand to include the new pjm companies 
the distribution companies were involved in transmission rate negotiations with the new and existing pjm companies new pjm footprint to ensure that the revenue neutrality provisions and pjm west start up costs granted by the ferc would continue to be recovered 
the distribution companies  pjm  and the new pjm companies filed an agreement with the ferc  which included a rate mechanism to protect the distribution companies against this risk of lost transmission revenues by modifying the revenue neutrality charge 
on april   the ferc accepted the filings of the new pjm companies to join pjm  effective as of the date of the transfer of control of facilities to pjm 
the rates were suspended for a nominal period and are the subject of ongoing settlement negotiations 

table of contents the distribution companies are involved in transmission rate negotiations to eliminate transmission charges for transactions between the midwest independent system operator miso and the new pjm footprint  as ordered by the ferc to begin on november  the distribution companies are again involved to ensure that the revenue neutrality provisions and pjm west start up costs granted by the ferc will continue to be recovered 
the ferc allowed the parties the ability to file for a transitional rate mechanism to collect lost revenues for up to two years  which is being negotiated between the parties 
allegheny is reviewing all options  while considering other activities and initiatives within pjm  to fully recover its transmission revenue requirement in future years 
it is expected that a rate filing will be a part of that process 
pjm and the miso published a paper on a congestion management seams issue that addresses coordination of seams between the new pjm footprint and the miso 
pjm and the miso are also currently negotiating a joint operating agreement to address inter regional coordination and plan to investigate the issues surrounding the expanded market 
natural gas distribution allegheny  through the operations of monongahela  is also active in the regulated natural gas business 
ae s revenues from its regulated natural gas operations amounted to less than percent of its total consolidated operating revenues 
beginning in  the ferc required pipeline operators to separate the cost of the transported natural gas from the cost of the transportation service and to provide comparable transportation service to all shippers whether they purchased natural gas from the pipeline operator or from another natural gas seller 
as a result  monongahela s natural gas division and subsidiary local distribution company  mountaineer  are required to obtain their natural gas supplies directly from producers and marketers and arrange for a pipeline to transport this natural gas to monongahela s facilities in west virginia 
in addition  residential unbundling at the state level is well under way nationwide and may provide the opportunity for small commercial firms and residential customers to purchase their own natural gas supplies in a competitive market 
mountaineer has been an open access transporter under its state tariff since the mid s  allowing residential  commercial  industrial  and wholesale customers to acquire their own natural gas supplies and requiring mountaineer to transport the natural gas to these customers 
more recently  the ferc expanded opportunities for firm holders of pipeline capacity to resell or release their capacity to other shippers and required pipeline operators to permit shippers to use flexible receipt and delivery points 
in  the ferc issued order to provide pipeline shippers with the right to segment or sub divide their capacity entitlements for their own use or for release to replacement shippers  eliminate the price cap on released pipeline capacity  clarify the rights of shippers to take service at secondary delivery points  and establish new rules for managing shipper imbalances on the pipelines 
mountaineer has been a very active participant in the capacity release market on two interstate pipeline systems columbia gulf transmission company and columbia gas transmission corporation 
releasing capacity allows mountaineer to defray pipeline demand charges 
conversely  the increased service flexibility available to all shippers may increase the demand for pipeline capacity  potentially making it more costly for mountaineer to access additional capacity to serve new customers 
in  the new york mercantile exchange nymex established a natural gas futures market 
while neither mountaineer nor monongahela purchase contracts directly from nymex  many of their contracts are based on nymex prices 
if nymex prices for natural gas futures increase  mountaineer s and monongahela s financial results could be adversely affected if they are unable or otherwise not permitted to recover reconciling rates from their customers 
allegheny ventures allegheny ventures engages in unregulated activities such as telecommunications and unregulated energy related projects 
allegheny ventures has two principal subsidiaries  acc and ae solutions 
acc develops fiber optic projects  including fiber and data services  and ae solutions manages energy related projects 

table of contents in december  ae solutions entered into an agreement to provide design  construction  and installation services for seven natural gas fired turbine generators for the smepa 
the seven units  with a combined output of approximately mw  will be located at three sites in southern mississippi 
the units will be owned by smepa 
construction started in may  with installation of all of the units to be completed by may employees neither ae supply nor any of the other registrants employs directly any employees  other than a small number of employees retained by ae supply who are associated with the lincoln generating facility  which ae supply acquired in all of the registrant s officers and employees are employed by aesc 
as of september   aesc employed approximately  employees 
approximately  of these employees are subject to collective bargaining arrangements 
approximately percent of the unionized employees are at the distribution companies and approximately percent are at ae s other subsidiaries 
approximately  employees are represented by system local of the utility workers union of america uwua 
there are approximately employees represented by other locals of the uwua  approximately are represented by locals of the paper  allied industrial  chemical  and energy workers international union  and approximately are represented by locals of the international brotherhood of electrical workers 
the current collective bargaining arrangements expire at various dates from the first quarter of to the last quarter of each of the registrants believes that current relations between it and its unionized and non unionized employees are satisfactory 
environmental matters the operations of the allegheny owned facilities  including generating stations  are subject to regulation as to air and water quality  hazardous and solid waste disposal  and other environmental matters by various federal  state  and local authorities 
the cost of meeting known environmental standards is provided in construction and other capital expenditures  above 
additional legislation or regulatory control requirements have been proposed and  if enacted  will require modifying  supplementing  or replacing equipment at existing stations at substantial additional cost 
air standards allegheny currently meets applicable standards as to particulate emissions at its power stations through high efficiency electrostatic precipitators  cleaned coal  flue gas conditioning  and  at times  reduction of output 
from time to time  minor excursions of stack emission opacity  that are normal to fossil fuel operations  are experienced and are accommodated by the regulatory process 
allegheny meets current emission standards as to so 

by the use of scrubbers  the burning of low sulfur coal  the purchase of cleaned coal to lower the sulfur content  and the blending of low sulfur with higher sulfur coal 
the caaa  among other things  require an annual reduction in total utility emissions within the united states of no 
x 
and so in an effort to introduce market forces into pollution control  the caaa created so emission allowances 
each allowance is an authorization to emit one ton of so into the atmosphere 
subject to regulatory limitations  allowances may be sold or banked for future use or sale 
allegheny has received allowances each year since the enactment of the caaa 
as part of its compliance strategy  allegheny continues to study  and  where appropriate  participate in the allowance market  making sales or purchases of allowances or participating in allowance transactions 

table of contents allegheny estimates that its banked allowances will allow it to economically comply with so limits through and possibly beyond 
studies are ongoing to evaluate cost effective options to comply with so limits  including those available in connection with the emission allowance trading market 
burner modifications at most of the allegheny operated stations satisfy the nox emission reduction requirements for the acid rain title iv provisions of the caaa 
additional nox reductions  which require selective catalytic reduction and or other combustion or post combustion control technologies  have been mandated in maryland  pennsylvania  and west virginia for ozone nonattainment reasons 
the epa has issued a nox state implementation plan sip call rule that requires the equivalent of a uniform lb mmbtu emission rate throughout a state region  including maryland  pennsylvania  and west virginia  beginning in may allegheny s compliance with such stringent regulations has required and will require the installation of expensive post combustion control technologies on most of its power stations 
during  pennsylvania and maryland promulgated final rules to implement the epa s nox sip call requirements  beginning in may during  the west virginia department of environmental protection issued a final rule to implement the epa s nox sip call requirements  beginning in may the epa approved the west virginia sip in july of the epa s nox sip call had been subject to litigation but  in  the dc circuit court of appeals issued a decision that upheld the regulation 
the court issued a subsequent order that postponed the initial compliance date of the nox sip call from may to may maryland and pennsylvania did not delay the may implementation dates of their respective sip  nor are they legally required to do so 
ae supply and monongahela are in the process of installing nox controls to meet the pennsylvania  maryland  and west virginia sip 
these nox controls include the installation of selective catalytic reduction at harrison power station and pleasants power station 
the no 
x 
compliance plan was established on a system wide basis much the same as was the so compliance plan 
the overcompliance at harrison and pleasants power stations permit excess nox emissions at other ae stations 
ae also has the option to purchase  in some cases  alternate fuels  nox allowances  or power on the market  if needed  to supplement our compliance strategy 
ae supply and monongahela expects to be in compliance with nox limits established by the sip 
from time to time  allegheny is required to engage in substantial site specific modifications to generating assets in response to federal or state regulatory action 
although they may be reactivated at any time  proceedings with respect to specific generation facilities in pennsylvania and west virginia have been dormant for many years 
capital outlays necessary to meet regulatory requirements can be substantial 
in august  ae received a letter from the epa under its nsr initiative requiring it to provide information and documentation relevant to the operation and maintenance of electric generating stations 
ae supply and monongahela own these electric generating stations 
the letter requested information under section of the clean air act to determine compliance with the clean air act and related requirements 
for further information about this inquiry  see item legal proceedings clean air act and caaa matters 
pending initiatives the epa promulgated revisions to particulate matter and ozone standards in july litigation over the revised particulate matter and ozone standards has recently been resolved and these requirements could impose substantial costs on allegheny 
allegheny does not anticipate final regulations before the epa has also promulgated final regional haze regulations to improve visibility in national parks and wilderness areas  which is currently under litigation 
the effect on allegheny of these standards or regulations is unknown at this time  but could be substantial 
in december  the epa made a determination for the regulatory controls of power plant mercury emissions 
the regulatory determination did not include any recommendations regarding the level or timing of reductions 
however  the epa plans to finalize a maximum achievable control technology standard by december based on this schedule  it is unlikely implementation of mercury controls would be required before 
table of contents the kyoto protocol  signed by the clinton administration  but not ratified by the us senate  would require drastic reductions in greenhouse gas emissions in the united states in response to the perceived threat of global warming 
if ratified and implemented  this treaty would likely require extensive mitigation efforts on the part of allegheny to reduce greenhouse gas emissions at electric generating plants and would raise considerable uncertainty about the future viability of fossil fuels as an energy source for new and existing electric generating facilities 
while the bush administration has rejected the kyoto protocol  other developed countries in the world are expected to ratify it and abide by its terms  beginning in the bush administration has proposed voluntary programs to reduce greenhouse gas intensity over the next decade  and various legislative proposals are under consideration at the federal and state level 
allegheny has taken voluntary steps to address the issue of global climate change 
it has signed a memorandum of understanding for the years to with the us department of energy to participate in the climate challenge 
as part of this agreement  allegheny has supported the climate challenge initiatives in cooperation with other companies through the edison electric institute and continues to explore alternatives  including a carbon sequestration through a pilot project to revegetate a former surface mine site in western pennsylvania 
the ultimate outcome of the global climate change debate and the kyoto protocol could have a significant effect on the industry in general and  on allegheny  in particular 
allegheny also participates in an active climate related research program and is responsive to the voluntary guidelines suggested in epact that are directed toward reducing  controlling  avoiding  and sequestering greenhouse gases 
examples of these efforts include commercial scale projects to use biomass as a renewable fuel source at two of allegheny s coal fired power stations 
allegheny has taken steps to reduce greenhouse gases and help stimulate a business climate that encourages improved efficiency  performance  electrical loss reductions  and cost effectiveness 
during the th congress  president bush s clear skies initiative was introduced in both the us house of representatives and senate 
the legislation is intended to eliminate title iv of the caaa and replace it with provisions designed to take a comprehensive and integrated approach to air emissions regulation 
the legislation was reintroduced in the th congress 
the clear skies initiative and expected alternative legislation are likely to be the focus of committee action on multi emission legislation 
the clear skies initiative does not include carbon reductions  but focuses on so  so  and mercury 
hearings on multi emissions legislation have been held in both the senate and the house  but subsequent legislative activity  if any  is uncertain 
water standards under the national pollutant discharge elimination system npdes  permits for all of allegheny s stations and disposal sites are in place and all facilities are generally in compliance with all permit terms  conditions  and effluent limitations other than as described in penalties and noncompliance below 
however  as permits are renewed  more stringent permit limitations are often applied 
to date  allegheny has either successfully developed and scientifically justified to the satisfaction of the regulatory agencies  alternate site specific water quality criteria or has installed passive constructed wetland treatment technology  thus avoiding significant capital costs and potential liabilities of advanced wastewater treatment 
however  there is significant activity at the federal level on cwa issues 
the results of several pending long term initiatives could cause allegheny and its customers to incur material and substantial costs 
there are pending rulemakings  for example  regarding the total maximum daily load tmdl program  water quality standards  antidegradation review  human health and aquatic life water quality criteria  mixing zones  and cwa section b cooling water intake structure 
in addition  the epa is developing new policies concerning protection of endangered species under the cwa and imposition of new cwa requirements to address sediment and biological water quality criteria contamination 
the outcome of these rulemakings will fundamentally change the traditional water quality management program from a chemical specific control of 
table of contents point sources to comprehensive and integrated watershed management 
this regulatory shift will result in more restrictions on facility discharges  as well as nonpoint source runoff  resulting from land use practices such as agriculture and forestry  and will ultimately address water quality impairment caused by atmospheric deposition 
tmdl program over the past several years  tmdls have become a significant issue 
consent orders in west virginia and pennsylvania require development and implementation of waste loads for point sources and load allocations for nonpoint sources on numerous waterbodies not currently meeting water quality standards within a relatively short time frame years 
because of the scientific complexity of the issue  paucity of water quality data  resource limitations of the state agencies  and political considerations  it is likely that resulting tmdls will require a disproportionate reduction in point source versus nonpoint source discharges 
the direct result of the tmdls will be further reductions in the amount of pollutants permitted to be discharged by allegheny owned power stations located on water quality impaired rivers 
tmdls can adversely affect allegheny by prohibiting new or increased discharges and curtailing the wastewater discharges of its industrial customers 
the epa intends to make revisions to the tmdl rule or may revise the currently effective regulations  implementing the tmdl program to achieve the goals of the cwa 
currently  the regulations that the epa promulgated in and amended in remain in effect for the tmdl program 
it is likely that water quality trading provisions will be incorporated into any new tmdl rule as a means to assist states in more cost effective implementation of tmdls 
the full effect of the rule on allegheny and its customers will not be known until the final rule is promulgated and the states complete tmdl development and implementation on impaired waters over the next years 
the states continue to develop tmdls under the existing rule  and allegheny is working with a number of watershed tmdl stakeholder groups  state agencies  and the epa to ensure development of sound and equitable tmdls 
cooling water intake current initiatives regarding rules applicable to cooling water intake structures are of concern to allegheny 
the cwa requires that cooling water intake structures reflect the best technology available for minimizing adverse environmental effects 
the epa is subject to a consent decree  which requires it to implement rules in this area in three phases phase i applies to new facilities that employ a cooling water intake structure 
the phase i final rule was published in december  phase ii pertains to existing utilities and nonutility power producers that currently employ a cooling water intake structure and whose flow exceeds a minimum threshold 
a proposed rule was published in the federal register on april   with final action to be taken by february   and phase iii will govern existing facilities that employ a cooling water intake structure not covered by the phase ii rule pulp and paper  chemical plants and whose intake flow exceeds a minimum threshold that will be determined by the epa 
the proposal is due by november   with final action on june  the phase i new facility rule applies to all new generation companies that began construction after january  it requires cooling towers for all new power plants in addition to limits on intake velocity  percentage of the waterbody used  and  in most cases  additional intake screens or other protective measures which are largely unspecified and may include fine mesh screens  wedgewire screens  or fabric barriers  along with extensive site specific study and monitoring requirements 
if the proposal stands  new facilities will suffer severe siting restrictions and will be subject to costly environmental studies and time delays to accomplish the studies 
moreover  the precedent setting effect that the new facility rule would have on existing facilities could be significant  potentially requiring additional environmental studies and possibly even the installation of cooling towers on those facilities that are shown to be causing an adverse environmental effect 
specific units could be 
table of contents forced to accept overall flow volume and velocity restrictions in water usage that could lead to derating units and undesirable energy supply reductions 
due to the concerns stated above  as well as the precedent setting potential of the forthcoming existing facility rule  the utility water act group filed a petition for review of the new facility rule with the dc circuit court of appeals 
several environmental groups also filed suit on the rule in the second circuit court of appeals 
because multiple parties have brought litigation on the same rule  the lawsuit will be consolidated in one of the circuit courts 
the proposed phase ii rule applies to all existing facilities with cooling water intakes that withdraw more than million gallons of water a day 
the rule would require subject facilities to reduce impingement mortality when fish become stuck on the cooling water intake screens by percent and  for most plants except facilities on lakes or a few plants on very large rivers or with low utilization  reduce entrainment of fish the smaller aquatic life that passes through the screens and enters the system by percent 
this new regulation is one size fits all and will impact all power plants with once through cooling 
the reduction is from a calculated baseline  which is based on a plant with an intake capacity commensurate with a once through cooling water system and with no impingement and or entrainment reduction controls 
if one can demonstrate that the costs of meeting these reduction standards is significantly greater  compared to the benefits  or to the costs the epa assumed in the rule making  then a site specific analysis may be performed rather than installing reduction technologies 
in any event  when applying for a permit a comprehensive demonstration study must be conducted and at least two years of monitoring data collected to verify the full scale performance of the proposed or implemented technologies 
allegheny would be required to perform these studies at a minimum of six of its power plants 
depending on requirements in the final regulation and the findings of the demonstration studies  cooling towers and other mechanical means of reducing impingement entrainment may also be required 
three of the plants are owned solely by ae supply and three are jointly owned by ae supply and monongahela 
other issues in  the pennsylvania department of environmental protection padep issued a draft npdes permit for mitchell power station 
the draft permit proposed to drastically lower the facility s thermal discharge limits 
cost estimates to achieve compliance with the proposed thermal limitations could be significant depending on final limitations and installation costs 
these costs would be incurred over a minimum of two years 
extensive comments were filed questioning the legality of the limits 
the padep has yet to respond to allegheny s comments or issue the final permit 
until then  mitchell will continue to operate under the requirements of its current npdes permit 
the epa lowered the maximum contaminant level mcl drinking water standard for arsenic from to micrograms per liter ug l 
because arsenic is a naturally occurring trace element present in the earth s crust  as well as in coal and coal combustion products  and because mcls are used in other regulatory programs such as groundwater protection  hazardous waste classification  and brownfield cleanup programs  allegheny may incur increased compliance costs as these regulatory programs adopt the new standard 
the full effect of this action on allegheny will not be known until it is determined how the various federal and or state regulatory programs implement the new standard 
the epa promulgated new spill prevention control and countermeasures spcc regulations  which became effective august  the timeline for compliance with the new spcc regulations requires that all plans be amended by august   and implemented as soon as possible  but not later than february  spcc regulations establish procedures  methods  and equipment to prevent the discharge of oil from nontransportation related facilities into or upon the navigable waters of the united states 
navigable waters include all types of waterways such as lakes  streams  and rivers  as well as areas such as wetlands  ponds  and tributaries 
these regulations will affect all allegheny owned facilities to varying degrees 

table of contents hazardous and solid wastes pursuant to the resource conservation and recovery act of and the hazardous and solid waste management amendments of  the epa regulates the disposal of hazardous and solid waste materials 
maryland  ohio  pennsylvania  virginia  and west virginia have also enacted hazardous and solid waste management regulations that are as stringent as or more stringent than the corresponding epa regulations 
allegheny is in a continual process of either permitting new or repermitting existing disposal capacity to meet future disposal needs 
all disposal facilities are currently operated in material compliance with their permits 
in addition to using coal combustion by products ccbs in various power plant applications such as scrubber by product stabilization at the harrison and mitchell power stations  ae supply on its own behalf and on behalf of monongahela continues to expand its efforts to market ccbs for beneficial applications  thereby reducing landfill requirements 
in  ae supply and monongahela received approximately million from the external sale and use of approximately  tons of fly ash   tons of bottom ash   tons of boiler slag  and  tons of flue gas desulfurization fgd material 
these ccbs were beneficially used in applications such as cement replacement in ready mix concrete  anti skid materials  grit blasting material  mine reclamation  mine subsidence  structural fills  and grouting of mines and oil wells 
in addition  ae supply and monongahela built a processing plant that converts the fgd by product from the pleasants power station into a commercial grade synthetic gypsum material that is used in the manufacture of wallboard 
this process significantly reduced the amount of the by product going to an impoundment 
penalties and noncompliance from time to time  the registrants are assessed penalties for noncompliance with applicable air and water quality and waste discharge laws and regulations 
in addition  the registrants may elect or be required to undertake remedial actions  which can result in substantial costs 
during  allegheny facilities violated npdes permit requirements times 
regulators may assess fines or other penalties or remedial measures 
each registrant is of the belief that no pending penalty assessments or asserted required remediation efforts applicable to the registrant will result in material costs to the registrant 
the west virginia division of air quality issued two notice of violation cease and desist orders  dated august  and september   for opacity violations at pleasants power station 
an opacity study was conducted and a final report  dated may  was submitted to the agency for its review 
no further action regarding this issue has been taken 
in addition  there have occasionally been particulate fallout incidents at pleasants power station 
although measures have been taken to correct the problem  it may eventually become necessary to close the scrubber bypass and construct a new stack  resulting in a significant capital expenditure for ae supply and monongahela  joint owners of the station

the transactions related to power sales during npc s claim was based  in part  on the assertion that dysfunctional california spot markets had an adverse effect on the prices npc was able to negotiate with ae supply under the contracts 
npc filed substantially identical complaints against a number of other energy suppliers 
a hearing was held before a ferc administrative law judge alj in late on december   the alj issued findings that no contract modification is warranted on the grounds that dysfunctional california spot markets did not have an adverse effect on the contract prices 
the alj determined in favor of the plaintiffs that ae supply  rather than merrill lynch  was a proper subject of npc s complaint 
on june   the ferc affirmed the alj s preliminary findings and issued an order upholding the long term contracts negotiated between npc and ae supply

putative shareholder  derivative  and benefit plan class actions from october through december  plaintiffs claiming to represent purchasers of ae s securities filed putative class action lawsuits against ae and several of its former senior managers in us district courts for the southern district of new york and the district of maryland 
the complaints allege that ae and senior management violated federal securities laws when ae purchased merrill lynch s energy marketing and trading business with the knowledge that the business was built on illegal wash or round trip trades with enron  which the complaints allege artificially inflated trading revenue  volume and growth 
the complaints assert that ae s fortunes fell when enron s collapse exposed what plaintiffs claim were illegal trades in the energy markets 
the complaints do not specify requested relief 

table of contents in february and march  two putative class action lawsuits were filed against ae in us district courts for the southern district of new york and the district of maryland 
the suits allege that ae and a senior manager violated the employee retirement income security act of erisa by failing to provide complete and accurate information to plan beneficiaries regarding the energy trading business  among other things  failing to diversify plan assets  failing to monitor investment alternatives  failing to avoid conflicts of interest  and violating fiduciary duties 
in june  a shareholder derivative action was filed against ae s board of directors and several current and former senior managers in the supreme court of the state of new york for the county of new york

both the securities cases and the erisa cases have been transferred to the district of maryland for coordinated or consolidated pre trial proceedings

claims related to alleged asbestos exposure as of september   monongahela has been named as a defendant  along with multiple other corporate defendants  in asbestos complaints filed on behalf of  plaintiffs  with each complaint naming one or more plaintiffs 
the suits have been brought primarily in state courts in west virginia  particularly in the circuit courts of brooke  hancock  harrison  kanawha  marshall  mason  monongalia  pleasants  and putnam counties 
suits regarding alleged asbestos exposure at allegheny owned facilities began to be brought in the early s  and new suits continue to be filed 
potomac edison and west penn have been named as defendants along with multiple other defendants in approximately one half of those cases 
because these cases are filed in a shotgun format  in which multiple plaintiffs file claims against multiple defendants in the same case  it is currently impossible to determine the actual number of cases in which plaintiffs make claims against the distribution companies 
based upon past experience and available data  it may be estimated that about one third of the total number of cases filed actually involve claims against any or all of the distribution companies 
all complaints allege that the plaintiffs sustained unspecified injuries resulting from claimed exposure to asbestos in various generating plants and other industrial facilities operated by the various defendants  although all plaintiffs do not claim exposure at facilities operated by all defendants 
with very few exceptions  plaintiffs claiming exposure at stations operated by the distribution companies were employed by third party contractors  not by the distribution companies 
generally  the operating legal presumption provides that an employee may recover damages against his or her direct employer through a worker s compensation claim  but not a tort claim 
three plaintiffs are known to be either present or former employees of monongahela  but have asserted that they are nonetheless eligible to assert tort suits 
each plaintiff generally seeks compensatory and punitive damages against all defendants in amounts of up to million and million  respectively 
in those cases which include a spousal claim for loss of consortium  damages are generally sought against all defendants in an amount of up to an additional million 
the majority of cases against the distribution companies have previously been dismissed or settled for an amount less than the anticipated cost of defense 
while the distribution companies believe that all of the cases are without merit  they cannot predict the outcome nor are they able to predict whether additional cases will be filed 
a recent us supreme court decision could have the effect of increasing the value of asbestos claims 
settlement values could also be affected by federal legislation currently being drafted 

table of contents comprehensive environmental response  compensation  and liability act of cercla claims on march   the distribution companies received notice that the epa had identified them as potentially responsible parties prps with respect to the jack s creek sitkin smelting superfund site 
initially approximately prps were involved  however  the current number of active prps is approximately the costs of remediation will be shared by all responsible parties 
in  a prp group that included the distribution companies entered into a consent order with the epa to remediate the site 
it is currently estimated that the total remediation costs to be borne by all of the responsible parties will not exceed million 
a final determination has not been made for the distribution companies share of the remediation costs 
however  at this time  it is estimated that the effect on the distribution companies will not be material 
on april   mountaineer received a request for information from the epa under the jurisdiction of the cercla  regarding a superfund site in west virginia 
a final determination regarding mountaineer s responsibility at the site has not been made 
however  based on available information  ae believes mountaineer  at most  would be considered a de minimis responsible party

a final determination regarding ae s responsibility at the site has not been determined 
clean air act and caaa matters the attorneys general of new york and connecticut  in letters dated september   and november   respectively  notified ae of their intent to commence civil actions against ae and or its subsidiaries alleging violations at the fort martin power station under the clean air act  which requires power plants that make major modifications to comply with the same new source review emission standards applicable to new power plants 
other governmental agencies may commence similar actions in the future 
fort martin power station is located in west virginia and is now jointly owned by ae supply and monongahela 
both attorneys general stated their intent to seek injunctive relief and penalties 
in addition  the attorney general of the state of new york indicated that he may assert claims under the state common law of public nuisance seeking to recover  among other things  compensation for alleged environmental damage caused in new york by the operation of the fort martin power station 
at this time  ae and its subsidiaries are not able to determine what effect  if any  these actions may have on them 
in august  ae received a letter from the epa requiring it to provide information and documentation relevant to the operation and maintenance of the following electric generating stations  collectively including generating units albright  armstrong  fort martin  harrison  hatfield s ferry  mitchell  pleasants  rivesville  r 
paul smith  and willow island 
ae supply and monongahela own these electric generating stations 
the letter requested information under section of the clean air act to determine compliance with the clean air act and related requirements  including potential application of the new source review standards  which can require the installation of additional air pollution control equipment upon the major modification of an existing facility 
responsive submissions were made during and in july  ae received a follow up letter from the epa requesting clarifying information 
ae provided responsive information 
similar inquiries have been made of other electric utilities and have resulted in enforcement proceedings being brought in most cases 
ae believes that its subsidiaries generating facilities have been operated in accordance with the clean air act and the rules implementing it 
the experience of other energy companies  however  suggests that in recent years  the epa has narrowed its view regarding the scope of the definition of routine maintenance under its rules  thereby broadening the range of actions subject to compliance with new source review standards 
under previous epa interpretations  these same actions did not trigger application of 
table of contents those standards 
section information requests concerning facility modifications are often followed by enforcement actions 
the epa contacted ae and requested a meeting  which was held on july  additional meetings will likely be scheduled in the next few months 
at this time  ae is not able to determine what effect the epa s inquiry may have on its operations 
if new source review standards are applied to ae generating stations  in addition to the possible imposition of fines  compliance would entail significant expenditures 
however  the recent preliminary judicial decision in the epa vs 
duke energy case  as well as the final routine maintenance  repair and replacement rule recently released by the epa  are more consistent with the energy industry s historical compliance approach 
therefore  at this time  ae and its subsidiaries are not able to determine the effect these actions may have on them with regard to compliance costs

monongahela reached an agreement with the epa through the doj resolving the agency s concerns in november the us district court for the northern district of west virginia accepted the consent decree  which the parties entered in february monongahela agreed to install additional piping and oil containment facilities and pumps at the substation to prevent any oil which may leak from the equipment from leaving the property  and this work was completed in in addition  monongahela paid a civil penalty in the amount of  on march  suits related to gleason generating facility allegheny energy supply gleason generating facility  llc  a subsidiary of ae supply  is the defendant in suits brought in the circuit court for weakley county  tennessee  by residents living in the vicinity of the generating facility in gleason  tennessee

table of contents allegheny energy  inc item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations allegheny energy  inc 
overview allegheny energy  inc ae and its consolidated subsidiaries collectively  allegheny have experienced significant changes in their businesses over the last several years  as described in item business recent events 
during  allegheny and allegheny energy supply company  llc ae supply experienced a strain on their liquidity positions  and  at december   a significant portion of their debt has been reclassified as current  as discussed in financial condition  requirements and resources 
also  allegheny incurred a net loss of million in  primarily due to trading losses and adverse wholesale energy market conditions experienced by its generation and marketing segment as discussed below in earnings summary 
in  allegheny identified various errors relating to its financial statements for years prior to as a result of a comprehensive financial review as discussed in note to its financial statements 
corrections to these errors are reflected in the consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and increased the net loss for by approximately million 
except for certain restatement adjustments to the consolidated balance sheet as of december   allegheny s management concluded that these errors were not material  either individually or in the aggregate  to the or any prior year s financial statements 
in the second quarter of  allegheny aligned its businesses into two segments 
the generation and marketing segment consists primarily of ae s subsidiary  ae supply  including its subsidiary  allegheny generating company agc 
ae supply is an unregulated ie  not subject to state rate regulation energy supply company that develops  owns  operates  and controls electric generating capacity and supplies and trades energy and energy related commodities 
this segment also includes generation assets for monongahela power company s monongahela west virginia regulatory jurisdiction  which has not deregulated electric generation 
the delivery and services segment consists primarily of allegheny s regulated utility subsidiaries monongahela  including its subsidiary  mountaineer gas company mountaineer  the potomac edison company potomac edison  and west penn power company west penn 
the delivery and services segment operates regulated electric and natural gas transmission and distribution t d systems 
this segment also includes allegheny ventures  an unregulated subsidiary  which invests in and develops fiber optic and data services through allegheny communications connect  inc acc and energy related projects 
review of operations critical accounting policies and estimates use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles of the united states of america gaap requires allegheny to make estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues  expenses  and related disclosure of contingencies during the reporting period 
the estimates that require management s most difficult  subjective  and complex judgments involve the fair value of commodity contracts and derivative instruments  adverse power purchase commitments  goodwill  unbilled revenues  regulatory assets and liabilities  pension and other postretirement benefit costs  and long lived assets 
significant changes in the estimates could have a material effect on allegheny s consolidated results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
commodity contracts through december   commodity contracts related to allegheny s energy trading activities were recorded at their fair value in accordance with the financial accounting standards board s fasb emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for energy trading and risk management activities 
as of january   eitf issue no 
was rescinded

 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
collectively referred to as sfas no 

at december   the fair value of allegheny s commodity contracts represented a net asset position of million 
fair values for exchange traded instruments  principally futures and certain options  are based on actively quoted market prices 
in establishing the fair value of commodity contracts that do not have quoted market prices  such as physical contracts  over the counter options  and swaps  management makes estimates using available and estimated market data and pricing models  which may change from time to time 
allegheny has several contracts that are unique  which extend to and beyond  and are valued using proprietary pricing models 
inputs to the models include estimated forward natural gas and electricity prices  interest rates  estimates of market volatility for natural gas and electricity prices  the correlation of natural gas and electricity prices  and other factors such as generating unit availability and location  as appropriate 
these inputs require management judgments and assumptions 
allegheny s models also adjust the fair value of commodity contracts to reflect uncertainty in prices  operational risks related to generating facilities  and risks related to the performance of counterparties 
these inputs become more challenging  and the models become less precise  the further into the future these estimates are made 
additionally  various factors  including reduced market liquidity  have significantly affected the merchant energy marketplace during market liquidity and the number of creditworthy participants have been dramatically reduced  and trading and origination opportunities have been significantly curtailed within energy markets 
actual effects on allegheny s consolidated financial position  cash flows  and results of operations may vary significantly from expected results if the judgments and assumptions underlying those models inputs prove to be wrong or the models prove to be unreliable 
allegheny s accounting for commodity contracts is discussed under operating revenues and note to the consolidated financial statements 
also  see note to the consolidated financial statements and derivative instruments and hedging activities for additional information regarding allegheny s accounting for derivative instruments under sfas no 
in addition to the above  the fair value of allegheny s commodity contracts can be affected by regulatory challenges involving deregulation of energy prices and markets 
the california public utility commission california puc  the california department of water resources cdwr  and the california electricity oversight board caeob challenged the contracts between the cdwr and ae supply 
in june  ae supply entered into a settlement agreement with the state of california to resolve the state s litigation regarding its power supply contract with the cdwr 
the terms of the settlement reduced the volume of power to be delivered from and reduced the sale price of off peak power to be delivered from  which in turn substantially reduced the value of the contract 
the following table shows the renegotiated prices and volumes year price per megawatt hour mwh peak off peak volume megawatt mw the contract s terms initially provided for a peak and off peak price per mwh of for the duration of the contract at a volume of mw in  mw in and  mw from as a result of the renegotiation of the contract with the cdwr  allegheny estimates that the fair value of the agreement decreased 
table of contents allegheny energy  inc by a range of to million 
the renegotiation of the contract terms was part of the agreement to settle litigation with the state of california regarding the contract s validity 
allegheny closed the sale of the contract to a subsidiary of the goldman sachs group  inc in september the california puc and the ferc approved the renegotiated agreement  effective august  the modified terms and conditions included in the renegotiated agreement will result in a reduction to the fair value of the cdwr agreement  with a corresponding reduction in earnings 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding the renegotiated agreement with the cdwr 
see also financial condition  requirements and resources liquidity and capital requirements and notes and for information regarding agreements entered into by ae supply to sell the cdwr power supply contract  and associated hedge transactions  and to terminate two tolling agreements in the western united states energy markets 
adverse power purchase commitments at december   allegheny s adverse power purchase commitment liability was million  which related to a contract that extends to the year as a result of the deregulation plan approved in for west penn  an adverse power purchase liability was recorded by allegheny related to a commitment to buy electricity from a nonutility generator at prices that are above the future expected market price for electricity 
a change in the estimated future market price of electricity or a change in the expected cost of the electricity purchased under the terms of the contract could have a material effect on the adverse power purchase commitment liability and on allegheny s results of operations and financial position 
excess of cost over net assets acquired goodwill as of december   allegheny s intangible asset for acquired goodwill was million related to the acquisition of an energy marketing and trading business in march effective january   with the adoption of sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  allegheny ceased amortization of goodwill and now tests goodwill for impairment at least annually 
as discussed in note  upon adoption of sfas no 
 allegheny recorded an impairment of goodwill related to its delivery and services segment of million  net of income taxes 
for allegheny  the estimation of the fair value of its reporting units  where a reporting unit represents an operating segment or one level below an operating segment  involves the use of present value measurements and cash flow models 
this process involves judgments on a broad range of information 
significant changes in the fair value estimates could have a material effect on allegheny s results of operations and financial position 
unbilled revenues unbilled revenues are primarily associated with allegheny s regulated utility subsidiaries 
energy sales to individual customers are based on the reading of their meters  which occurs on a systematic basis throughout the month 
at the end of each month  amounts of energy delivered to customers subsequent to the last meter reading are estimated and the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize unbilled revenues 
the unbilled revenue estimates are based on daily generation  purchases of electricity and natural gas  estimated customer usage by customer type  weather effects  electric and natural gas line losses  and the most recent consumer rates 
as this process uses several significant estimates and assumptions  a significant change in them could have a material effect on allegheny s consolidated results of operations and financial position 
regulatory assets and liabilities allegheny s regulated utility subsidiaries are regulated by various federal and state regulatory agencies 
as a result  the regulated utility subsidiaries qualify for the application of sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation  which recognizes that the actions of a regulator can provide reasonable assurance of the existence of an asset or liability 
regulatory assets or liabilities arise as a result of a difference between gaap  excluding the effects of rate regulation  and the economic effect of decisions by regulatory agencies 
regulatory assets generally represent incurred costs that have been deferred  as they are probable of recovery in customer rates 
regulatory liabilities generally represent obligations to make refunds to customers for various reasons 

table of contents allegheny energy  inc the regulated utility subsidiaries recognize regulatory assets and liabilities in accordance with the rulings of their federal and state regulators 
future regulatory rulings may affect the carrying value and accounting treatment of allegheny s regulatory assets and liabilities at each balance sheet date 
allegheny assesses whether the regulatory assets are probable of future recovery by considering factors such as regulatory environment changes  recent rate orders issued by the applicable regulatory agencies  and the status of any pending or potential deregulation legislation 
the assumptions and judgments used by regulatory authorities continue to have an effect on the recovery of costs  the rate of return on invested capital  and the timing and amount of assets to be recovered by rates 
a change in these assumptions may result in a material effect on allegheny s results of operations  cash flows  and financial position 
accounting for pensions and postretirement benefits other than pensions allegheny accounts for pensions under sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions and other postretirement benefits under sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
under these rules  certain assumptions are made which represent significant estimates 
there are many factors and assumptions involved in determining allegheny s pension and other postretirement benefit obligations and costs each period  such as employee demographics including age  life expectancies  compensation levels  discount rates  rate of return on invested funds  estimated compensation increase rates  medical inflation  and the fair value of assets funded for the plan see note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information concerning assumptions used by allegheny 
changes made to provisions of pension or other postretirement benefit plans may also affect current and future pension and opeb costs 
allegheny s assumptions are supported by historical data and reasonable projections and are reviewed annually with an outside actuarial firm 
as of december   allegheny utilized a percent discount rate and a percent expected return on plan assets 
in selecting an assumed discount rate  allegheny reviews various corporate aa bond indices 
the percent expected return on plan assets is consistent with allegheny s historical returns and is based on projected long term equity and bond returns  maturities and asset allocations 
the table below shows the effect that a basis point increase or decrease in the discount rate and expected return on plan assets would have on allegheny s pension and other postretirement benefits opeb costs in millions percentage point increase percentage point decrease change in the discount rate pension and opeb benefit obligation net periodic cost pension and opeb change in expected return on plan assets net periodic cost pension and opeb long lived assets allegheny s consolidated balance sheet includes significant long lived assets  which are not subject to recovery under sfas no 
as a result  allegheny must generate future cash flows from such assets in a non regulated environment to ensure the carrying value is not impaired 
certain of these assets are the result of capital investments that have been made in recent years and have not yet reached a mature life cycle 
allegheny assesses the carrying amount and potential impairment of these assets whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors allegheny considers in determining if an impairment review is necessary include a significant underperformance of the assets relative to historical or projected future operating results  a significant change in allegheny s use of the assets or business strategy related to such assets  and significant negative industry or economic trends 
when allegheny determines that an impairment review is necessary  a comparison is made between the expected undiscounted future cash flows and the carrying amount of the asset 
if the carrying amount of the asset is the larger of the two balances  an impairment loss is recognized equal to the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset exceeds the fair value of the asset 
in these cases  the fair value is determined by the use of quoted market prices  appraisals  or 
table of contents allegheny energy  inc the use of valuation techniques such as expected discounted future cash flows 
allegheny must make assumptions regarding these estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of the respective assets 
significant changes to these assumptions could have a material effect on allegheny s consolidated results of operations and financial position

per share  consisting of million for the delivery and services segment and million for the generation and marketing segment  respectively  for workforce reduction costs related to allegheny s voluntary early retirement option ero program and other employee severance costs  and for restructuring charges and related asset impairment 
the decrease in earnings per share reflects the decrease in net income and the effects of an increased average number of shares outstanding  due to the issuance of million shares on may   and million shares during for various allegheny benefit plans 
also for  allegheny completed its assessment of goodwill in accordance with sfas no 
the assessment determined that approximately million of goodwill  primarily related to the acquisitions of mountaineer and west virginia power wvp  was impaired 
as a result  allegheny recorded a charge of million  net of income taxes per share  as the cumulative effect of an accounting change as of january  the increase in earnings for  before extraordinary charge and cumulative effect of accounting change  was driven by the addition of unregulated generating capacity and unrealized gains from energy trading activities resulting from the newly acquired energy trading business 
the increase in the generation and marketing segment s net revenues included the results of the acquired energy trading business  since march  the increase in earnings for the delivery and services segment for was due to an increase in revenues from unregulated services  largely offset by increases in purchased energy and transmission and natural gas purchases

the increase in the delivery and services segment s regulated electric revenues for was primarily due to an increase in the average number of customers  partially offset by a decrease in heating degree days of percent versus the prior year 
regulated electric revenues include choice revenues that represent t d revenues from customers in west penn s pennsylvania  potomac edison s maryland and virginia  and monongahela s ohio distribution territories who chose alternate electricity generation suppliers 
pennsylvania  maryland  virginia  and ohio deregulation gave west penn s  potomac edison s  and monongahela s regulated customers the ability to choose another electricity generation supplier 
for and  all of west penn s regulated customers  potomac edison s maryland regulated customers  and monongahela s ohio regulated customers had the ability to choose another electricity generation supplier 
potomac edison s virginia regulated customers had the ability to choose alternate electricity generation suppliers beginning on january  the return of customers to full service does not affect sales since allegheny determines sales on the basis of kilowatt hours kwh delivered to customers regardless of their electricity generation supplier 
however  such a return of customers to full service results in an increase in revenues due to the addition of a generation charge that allegheny had not collected while the customers were using an alternate electricity generation supplier 
for  the effect on revenues of customers returning to full service was especially noticeable in the commercial and industrial classes where a higher 
table of contents allegheny energy  inc percentage of sales were associated with choice customers returning to full service 
for  approximately 
percent of the combined west penn regulated customers  potomac edison maryland and virginia regulated customers  and monongahela ohio regulated customers chose alternate electricity generation suppliers 
for  approximately 
percent of the combined west penn regulated customers  potomac edison maryland and virginia regulated customers  and monongahela ohio regulated customers chose alternate electricity generation suppliers 
the delivery and services segment s regulated natural gas revenues include monongahela and mountaineer for and because a significant portion of the natural gas sold by monongahela s natural gas distribution operations is ultimately used for space heating  both revenues and earnings are subject to seasonal fluctuations 
under the purchased gas adjustment pga mechanism  differences between revenues received for energy costs and actual energy costs are deferred until the next rate proceeding  when energy rates are adjusted to return or recover previous overrecoveries or underrecoveries  respectively 
the pga mechanism continues to exist for monongahela and came into effect for mountaineer following a three year moratorium  which ended on october  for  the decrease in the delivery and services segment s regulated natural gas revenues was primarily due to mountaineer s commercial customers switching to other natural gas suppliers and becoming transportation customers only 
the increase in the delivery and services segment s regulated natural gas revenues for was primarily due to monongahela s acquisition of mountaineer in august the delivery and services segment s transmission services and bulk power revenues decreased million for and increased million for transmission services and bulk power revenues included the sale of the output of the aes warrior run cogeneration facility into the open wholesale market

table of contents allegheny energy  inc approximately million of allegheny s commodity contracts were classified above as prices based on models even though a portion of these contracts are valued based on observable market prices 
the most significant variables to allegheny s models used to value these contracts are the forward prices for both electricity and natural gas 
these forward prices are based on observable market prices to the extent prices are available in the market 
generally  electricity forward prices are actively quoted for about one year  and some observable market prices are available for about three years 
after three years  the forward prices for electricity are based on the forward price of natural gas and a marginal heat rate for generation based on more efficient natural gas fired generation to convert natural gas into electricity 
for natural gas  forward prices are generally actively quoted for about three years  and some observable market prices are available for about five years 
beyond five years  natural gas prices are escalated  based on trends in prior years

during  the depressed wholesale energy markets significantly affected the merchant energy business  including allegheny s energy trading activities 
additional generating capacity  coupled with lower than expected demand for electricity due to the weak economy  have led to reduced wholesale prices in several regional markets 
also  the enron bankruptcy  the california energy crisis  energy trading improprieties by certain companies  the planned retreat of several merchant energy companies from energy trading markets  and the decline in credit quality of merchant energy companies has negatively affected the liquidity of the wholesale energy markets 
during the third quarter of  allegheny announced a restructuring of its energy marketing and trading activities 
allegheny is significantly reducing its reliance on the wholesale energy trading business primarily by restricting activities to an asset backed strategy using its low cost generating assets located in the mid atlantic and midwest 
as a result  allegheny s trading activities will focus on lowering risk  optimizing the value of its generating assets  and reducing the effect of mark to market earnings to the extent possible 

table of contents allegheny energy  inc as a result of significant changes in market conditions  and in conjunction with allegheny s decision to restructure its energy trading activities  allegheny performed a comprehensive assessment of the valuation techniques and assumptions used to value its existing portfolio of energy commodity contracts 
to reflect current market conditions  allegheny revised the valuation techniques and assumptions for certain contracts with option features 
as a result  allegheny reduced the value of its portfolio of energy commodity contracts by million  before income taxes  in the third quarter of during the fourth quarter of  the fair value of allegheny s portfolio of commodity contracts was reduced by an additional million  before income taxes 
this reduction in fair value resulted from a decrease in the liquidity and volatility of the energy markets in the wscc 
this decrease in market liquidity and volatility primarily affected the fair values related to allegheny s contractual right to call up to  mw of generation in southern california from williams and the agreement with lv cogen to call upon up to mw of generating capacity 
on february   the california puc approved a rate agreement with the cdwr in order for the cdwr to issue power supply revenue bonds to repay the state of california s general fund and other outstanding loans and pay its ongoing long term purchased power costs 
the agreement creates two streams of revenue for the cdwr by calling for the california puc to impose bond charges and power charges on retail electric customers sufficient to pay the cdwr s debt service and operating expenses  including payment of its long term power purchase agreements with allegheny

to date  all payments to allegheny by the cdwr for purchased power have been made on time and in full 
the california puc rate agreement and the long term credit ratings are positive developments relative to the prior assumptions used in assessing the long term creditworthiness of the cdwr and the estimation of the fair value of allegheny s contracts with the cdwr 
as a result  the valuation adjustments used in estimating the fair value of these contracts have been reduced 
allegheny recorded a million increase in the estimated fair value of the cdwr contract in the first quarter of during  allegheny did not have any changes in the fair value of commodity contracts attributed to changes in valuation techniques 
the net fair value of allegheny s commodity contracts increased by million as a result of unrealized gains recorded during of the unrealized gains  million related to allegheny s contracts in the wscc 
this increase in the fair value of the wscc portfolio was driven by the fixed price contract to sell power for approximately years to the cdwr  which increased in fair value as prices dropped in the wscc during the increase in the fair value of the cdwr contract was partly offset by decreases in the fair value of the contract with williams to call up to  mw of generating capacity in southern california and other contracts primarily used to hedge the wscc portfolio  including the agreement with lv cogen 
during and  allegheny s energy trading and excess generation activities resulted in million and million of net realized losses  respectively 
these losses were mainly related to allegheny s contract with the cdwr and the related hedges and  in the fourth quarter of  trade terminations resulting from allegheny s failure to post collateral in favor of several counterparties following the downgrading of allegheny s credit rating below investment grade by moody s 
these losses were partially offset by realized gains from the sale of generation in excess of the power provided to allegheny s regulated utility subsidiaries to meet their plr obligations 
ae supply hedged the on peak positions of the cdwr contract at prices above the fixed contract price of per mwh that ae supply received from the cdwr 
there has been  and may continue to be  significant volatility in the market prices for electricity and natural gas at the wholesale level  which will affect allegheny s operating results 
similarly  volatility in interest rates

refocusing trading activities adoption of asset based trading strategy 
ae supply is reorienting its trading operations from high volume financial trading in national markets to asset optimization and hedging within its region 
ae supply is implementing this rebalancing over time as its liquidity allows 
effectively exiting the western united states power markets  together with unwinding substantial non core trading positions  has enabled ae supply to reduce long term trading related cash out flows and collateral obligations 
in the future  ae supply will seek to concentrate its efforts in the pjm  the midwest  and mid atlantic markets where it has a physical presence and greater market knowledge 
ultimately  ae supply intends to conduct asset optimization and hedging activities with the primary objective of locking in cash flows associated with ae supply portfolio of core physical generating and load positions 
relocation of trading operations 
ae supply moved its energy marketing operations from new york to monroeville  pennsylvania on may  and has reduced its trading operations 
this transition will result in ongoing cost savings and improve integration with ae supply s generation activity 
the reduced staffing levels are intended to reflect the newly revised focus of the trading function 
management believes that both trading and marketing and generation operations can be enhanced by locating trading personnel closer to personnel managing ae supply s generating assets 
personnel involved in the separate functions can be cross trained and will be better positioned to enhance the relationship between the two functions
