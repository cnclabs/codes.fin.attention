overview visx  incorporated visx  a delaware corporation organized in  is a worldwide leader in the design and development of proprietary technologies and systems for laser vision correction 
we sell products worldwide and generate the majority of our revenue through the sale of visionkey cards that are required to perform laser vision correction procedures on the visx star excimer laser system visx star system 
we have also licensed our technology to other excimer laser system companies and generally receive royalties from the sale of their systems outside the us and from procedures that are performed in the us using their systems 
the food and drug administration fda and comparable international regulatory agencies have approved the visx system for use in the treatment of most types of refractive vision disorders including nearsightedness  farsightedness  and astigmatism 
the fda has also approved our wavescan wavefront system wavescan system  a diagnostic device that measures refractive errors in a person s vision more precisely than previously available technology 
in international markets  the wavescan is used in conjunction with our visx star system to perform customvue laser vision correction  which enhances laser vision correction and potentially improves vision beyond that of contacts and glasses 
in the us  we are awaiting fda approval for the treatment of patients using the data from our wavescan system 

table of contents economic  market  and technology changes frequently affect the laser vision correction industry and visx and could harm our business in the future 
please see the section of this report entitled risk factors  which begins on page  for a more thorough description of the risks that our business faces 
if any of the risks in this risk factors section materialize  orders and revenues for visx systems and visionkey cards could fluctuate or decline 
accordingly  our past results may not be useful in predicting our future results 
results of operations compared to year ended december  change s revenue system revenues percent of revenues service and parts revenues percent of revenues license and other revenues percent of revenues total system revenues system revenues in were million lower than in due to a decline in sales of visx star systems and visx star system upgrade revenue  which was partially offset by an increase in the sale of wavescan systems 
visx star system revenues revenue declined million from to million due to the recession both us and worldwide and aggressive pricing tactics by competitors 
laser upgrade revenue decreased million from to million because a majority of our us customers upgraded their visx star s tm systems to the new visx star s model during since we began installing the visx star s upgrade in the fourth quarter of  we have upgraded approximately of the visx star s lasers based in the us accordingly  we anticipate that upgrade revenue will decline significantly in wavescan system sales increased million from to million as we continued to extend our rollout of this product 
service and parts revenues service and parts revenues in were million lower than in mainly due to a new service plan which effectively reduces the price charged for service contracts on laser systems with lower than average procedure volume 
license and other revenues license and other revenue in was million lower than in mainly due to a decline in the volume of us procedures for which visx earned procedure fees 
declines in the volume of laser vision correction procedures in the us have correlated with deterioration in the health of the us economy the rise in unemployment  declines in the stock market  and lower consumer confidence 
this is consistent with the view that consumers current perceptions and expectations about the future health of the economy affect their spending habits 
we believe that the rebound generally forecast for the us economy and consumer confidence will provide renewed support for the us laser vision correction market in the future 
the decision to have laser vision correction surgery is influenced by many factors 
the procedure is elective and generally not covered by medical insurance  therefore it competes with many types of purchases for consumers discretionary spending 
perceptions about safety and effectiveness of the procedure are additional considerations 
the lack of long term follow up studies of the procedure combined with media coverage of selected unfavorable outcomes may contribute to uncertainty and delay by some potential consumers 
we believe that ongoing technical advances including 
table of contents custom lasik  which have the potential to improve a person s vision beyond that which can be obtained with contact lenses or glasses  will reduce concerns perceived by some consumers 
notwithstanding  we cannot accurately predict when  or to what extent  these anticipated changes in the economy and technology will impact our license and other revenues 
year ended december  change s costs and expenses cost of system revenues percent of revenues cost of service and parts revenues percent of revenues cost of license and other revenues percent of revenues selling  general and administrative percent of revenues research  development and regulatory percent of revenues cost of system revenues cost of system revenues declined million  which was due to lower cost of revenues for laser upgrades approximately million partially offset by higher cost of system revenues approximately million 
cost of upgrade revenues were lower due to reduced laser upgrade revenues in than in higher cost of visx star system and wavescan system revenue is attributable to increased wavescan system revenue in than in offset in part by a reduction of visx star system sales in than in the gross profit margin on upgrade revenue was higher in than in due to the introduction of new product technologies 
since we have upgraded of the visx star s systems based in the us  we anticipate upgrade revenue and gross profit will decline significantly in cost of service and parts revenues cost of service and parts revenues increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was due to higher costs to service a larger installed base 
cost of license and other revenues cost of license and other revenues increased slightly from to the increase was due to additional licensee support provided in compared to our gross profit margin on cost of license and other revenue was lower due predominately to the decline in our us procedure volume 
selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses declined slightly from to the net decrease was due to a million reduction in provision for uncollectible accounts receivables in over our policy is to provide allowances against receivables based on our assessment of our customers ability to meet their financial obligations 
as a result of this analysis  our provision for doubtful accounts receivable was million in as compared to million in additionally  legal expenses decreased in as the result of insurance reimbursements of million received during excluding these reimbursements  legal expenses increased million in over also recorded in was a million increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses attributable to an impairment charge related to our investment in medjet inc 
table of contents research  development  and regulatory expenses our research  development  and regulatory expenses decreased less than million 
we continued to focus on next generation technologies and developments for laser vision correction 
these included laser platforms such as our star s laser system  eye diagnostic units such as our wavescan system  and new methods for correcting vision disorders including our customvue treatment and early research and clinical trials on treatments for presbyopia 
we also continued funding early stage research at stanford university for future treatments for age related macular degeneration amd 
we anticipate that our r d and regulatory expenses in will be consistent with our expenditures in interest and other income our average balance of cash invested in interest bearing securities was lower in than in due to cash used to repurchase our stock 
additionally  as market interest rates decreased throughout the year the average yield on our portfolio of cash and investments was lower in compared to accordingly  interest income declined in from income tax provision our effective tax rate decreased in from due to tax benefits associated with a larger percentage of our sales occurring outside the us and a lower state income tax rate due to apportionment differences 
legal contingencies we have signed a term sheet with nidek outlining a global litigation settlement and patent cross license 
the settlement outlined in the term sheet will resolve all litigation between the parties worldwide  including all of the parties patent and antitrust lawsuits in the united states 
the settlement also will involve a worldwide cross license of certain of the parties respective patents  and the payment by visx to nidek of approximately million for the settlement of nidek s antitrust and related claims 
we expect that this payment will be more than offset by future savings realized from the avoidance of legal fees 
the settlement and cross license will not become effective until the signing of a final written agreement 
upon the signing of this agreement  the parties will submit requests for dismissal of the lawsuits to the appropriate courts for approval 
as a result of the signing of the march  term sheet  we believe that a final settlement is probable and have recorded a million charge for litigation settlement expense in results of operations compared to year ended december  change s revenue system revenues percent of revenues service and parts revenues percent of revenues license and other revenues percent of revenues total system revenues system revenues in were million lower than in due to a decline in sales of visx star systems  which was partially offset by an increase in revenue from visx star system upgrades and the introduction of our new wavescan system in visx star systems revenue declined million from to million due to a number of factors the recession both us and worldwide  increased competition  and delay in regulatory approval of 
table of contents our visx star s system in japan 
laser upgrade revenue increased million from to million because a majority of our us customers upgraded their star s laser systems to the new star s model during we began installing the visx star s upgrade in the fourth quarter of at the end of  we had upgraded approximately of the star s lasers based in the us the introduction of our new wavescan system generated a small amount of additional sales revenue in service and parts revenues service and parts revenues in were million higher than in mainly due to a larger installed base of laser systems 
license and other revenues license and other revenues in were million lower than in mainly due to a decline in license and other procedure fees from us customers 
procedure fees declined due to a combination of lower volume of procedures for which visx earned procedure fees million and lower procedure prices million 
effective february   we reduced the price of our license fee from to per procedure performed on a visx laser in the us the decision to have laser vision correction surgery is influenced by many factors including consumers confidence in and perception of the health of the economy 
we believe the economic recession  drop in consumer confidence in and the stock market decline in the united states were the principal causes of the decline in our procedure volume and the us laser vision correction market as a whole in from year ended december  change s costs and expenses cost of system revenues percent of revenues cost of service and parts revenues percent of revenues cost of license and other revenues percent of revenues selling  general  and administrative percent of revenues research  development  and regulatory percent of revenues cost of system revenues cost of system revenues declined million  which was due to lower unit sales of visx star systems approximately million  partially offset by additional cost of revenues for laser upgrades approximately million 
cost of upgrade revenues were higher due to increased laser upgrade revenues in than in the gross profit margin on cost of revenue was lower in than in due to less product sold in cost of service and parts revenues cost of service and parts revenues increased slightly from to the increase was due to higher costs to service a larger installed base 
cost of license and other revenues cost of license and other revenues decreased less than million in the decrease was due to a reduction in keycards sold in compared to our gross profit margin on cost of license and other revenue was lower due predominately to the decline in our us procedure volume and the reduction in our license fee per procedure in february 
table of contents selling  general  and administrative expenses selling  general  and administrative expenses declined due to a million reduction in expense for uncollectible accounts receivables and million less in spending on marketing and promotional programs 
our policy is to provide allowances against receivables based on our assessment of our customers ability to meet their financial obligations 
as a result of this analysis  our additions to reserves against accounts receivable were million in as compared to million in the reserves added in were higher than in other years because a number of customers developed significant problems due to a variety of factors including over expansion and the rapid transition in the us economy from high growth to contraction 
approximately million of receivables identified as potential problems in subsequently became uncollectible and were written off in our selling  general and administrative expenses in also included a charge to fully reserve a million long term note we advanced to a customer 
this long term note was subsequently written off due to the bankruptcy of this customer in research  development  and regulatory expenses our research and development expenses increased due to increased spending in our three main areas of focus new capabilities for the visx star excimer laser platform  development of new products such as our wavescan system and wavefront driven ablations  and research into new technologies 
interest and other income our average balance of cash invested in interest bearing securities was lower in than in due to cash used to repurchase our stock 
additionally  our average yields on our portfolio of cash and investments were lower in compared to as market interest rates decreased throughout the year 
accordingly  interest income declined in from litigation settlement lawsuits were filed against us in in connection with the activities of pillar point partners pillar point  a partnership between subsidiaries of visx and summit technologies  inc summit 
the purported class action lawsuits alleged  among other things  violations of various state and federal antitrust and unfair competition laws 
other claims involving pillar point were filed against visx  summit and others at various times 
the pillar point partnership was dissolved in  and in we and summit  now a subsidiary of alcon  inc  settled certain of these actions 
in connection with the settlements  visx paid a total of million in payments and related costs and fees 
as a result of the settlements  all of the lawsuits have been dismissed with prejudice 
we settled a number of litigation matters during and paid a total of million in one time payments and related costs and fees in connection with these settlements 
we settled antitrust and other claims against visx filed by jon dishler and associated parties dishler 
this settlement included a resolution of the claims filed in by pillar point  summit partner  and visx partner against dishler 
we also settled a lawsuit filed by john taboada against stephen trokel  visx  and visx partner seeking  among other things  a declaration that taboada was the inventor of our us patent no 
b  and a payment of royalties received by visx for the patent 
in connection with the taboada settlement  the parties signed and filed with the court a stipulated judgment stating that dr 
trokel is the sole inventor of the patent  and taboada s proceeding seeking a stay of the reexamination of the patent was dismissed 
finally  we settled an action filed by a group of former clinical investigators of the system made by taunton technologies corporation a predecessor of visx in which the plaintiffs alleged federal antitrust law violations  breach of contract  and unjust enrichment

seasonal variation 
typically we experience an increase in procedure related revenue in the united states market in the first quarter of each calendar year 
we attribute this increase to consumers using the annual renewal of funding under the internal revenue service code section pre tax medical savings plan to purchase laser vision correction for themselves 
laser vision correction is not generally covered by medical insurance 
our equipment and procedure revenues tend to decline in the summer 
critical accounting policies we follow accounting principles generally accepted in the united states gaap in preparing our financial statements 
as part of this work  we must make many estimates and judgments about future events 
these affect the value of the assets and liabilities  contingent assets and liabilities  and revenues and expenses that we report in our financial statements 
we believe these estimates and judgments are reasonable and we make them in accordance with our accounting policies based on information available at the time 
however  actual results could differ from our estimates and this could require us to record adjustments to expenses or revenues that could be material to our financial position and results of operations in future periods 
our critical accounting policies used in making these estimates and judgments are as follows 
revenue recognition our revenue is comprised of the following sale and rental of system equipment and upgrades  service revenue  and license fees and related procedure revenue procedure revenue 
we recognize revenue in accordance with sec staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements sab 
under this standard  revenue is generally recognized when the following four criteria are met persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  our selling price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
all of our sales are documented by contract or purchase orders specifying sales prices and terms 
we sell directly to end customers in the us within the us and japan we directly handle installation of our systems and upgrades and recognize revenue on these products after we have completed installation at a customer s site 
at this point we accrue an estimate of the cost of warranty service to be provided in the future 
outside the us and japan our 
table of contents standard terms are fob visx and we sell exclusively through independent  third party distributors who are generally responsible for all marketing  sales  installation  training and warranty labor coverage for our products 
accordingly  we recognize system revenue when we ship systems for customers outside the us and japan and accrue an estimate of the cost of parts that we are obligated to provide under warranty 
under sales type lease agreements  system revenues are recognized upon shipment or installation  as appropriate 
under rental or operating lease agreements for systems  rental revenue is recognized over the term of the agreement 
for customers who purchase service contracts  we recognize service revenue over the term of the contract 
payments received in advance of services performed are recorded as deferred revenue 
for customers without service contracts  we recognize service revenue when we provide service 
we record spare parts revenue upon shipment of the parts 
we recognize license fees and related procedure revenue from direct customers when we ship vision keycards 
we recognize license fees from third party licensees when we receive payment 
we classify shipping costs  net of any billings  in cost of revenues 
we assess the credit worthiness of all customers in connection with their purchases 
we only recognize revenue when collectibility is reasonably assured 
if this is not the case  then we record revenue only as payments are received 
accounts receivable customers are evaluated for credit worthiness and we recognize revenue when collectibility is reasonably assured 
at the end of each accounting period  we estimate the reserve necessary for accounts receivables that will ultimately not be collectible from customers 
to develop this estimate  we review all receivables and identify those accounts with problems 
for these problem accounts  we estimate individual  specific reserves based on our analysis of the payment history  operations and finances of each account 
for all other accounts  we review historical bad debt trends  general and industry specific economic trends  customer concentrations  and current payment patterns to estimate the reserve necessary to provide for payment defaults that cannot be specifically identified but can be expected with reasonable probability to occur in the future 
we face two particular challenges in estimating these reserves concentration of credit with certain large customers and the potential for significant change in the overall health of the national economies in the markets we serve 
unexpected deterioration in the health of either a large customer or a national economy could lead to a material adverse impact on the collectibility of our accounts receivable and our future operating results 
inventories inventories consist of purchased parts  subassemblies and finished systems and are stated at the lower of cost or market  using the first in  first out method 
we regularly review our inventory on hand plus on order and compare this to our estimate of demand over the following months 
based on this analysis  we reduce the carrying value of our inventory for excess and obsolete items 
changes in competition  the economy  and technology can lead to variation in demand for our products 
if the change in demand is significant  we may need to further reduce the carrying value of our inventory 
all inventory write downs result in a new cost basis and are charged to cost of revenues  accordingly any inventory write down would impact our reported cost of revenues 
legal contingencies we are involved in a variety of legal proceedings including those concerning intellectual property rights  claims that we violated antitrust laws  and other litigation proceedings 
in cases brought against us  we must assess the probability of an adverse decision 
if we believe it probable that we will lose in our defense and we can reasonably estimate the loss  we accrue an estimate of the potential loss 
currently we do not believe it is probable that we will lose cases currently pending and  accordingly  have not accrued any amounts for legal settlements 
please see note to our consolidated financial statements for information concerning the term sheet signed on march  by visx and nidek outlining a global litigation settlement and patent cross license 
however  the results of these complex legal proceedings are very difficult to predict with certainty 
in addition  because a number of the proceedings have issues in common  an adverse determination in one proceeding could lead to adverse determinations in one or more of the other pending proceedings 
adverse determinations in any of these proceedings could limit our ability to collect equipment and use fees in certain markets  could give rise to significant monetary damages  or could prevent us from manufacturing and selling our laser system  and therefore could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  and results of operations 

table of contents liquidity and capital resources change change cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments working capital stockholders equity our cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments consist principally of money market funds  and government and corporate bonds 
all of our short term investments are classified as available for sale under the provisions of sfas  accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
the securities are carried at fair market value with the unrealized gains and losses  net of tax  included in accumulated other comprehensive income  which is reflected as a separate component of stockholders equity 
realized gains and losses are recognized when realized on the consolidated statements of operations 
cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments decreased by million in principally because we spent million to repurchase million shares of visx stock on the open market 
this was offset by million of net cash provided by operating activities and million from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs 
the extent to which our employees exercise stock options can vary due to a number of factors  especially changes in the market price of our common stock 
as a result  our cash flow resulting from the issuance of common stock related to employee participation in employee stock programs can vary 
operating activities provided million of cash in  up from million provided in the principal factors that contributed to this difference are as follows 
net income increased by million due mainly to the legal settlement of million pre tax in and the legal fee reimbursement of million in offset by a decline in revenue of million in deferred income tax assets and prepaid expenses decreased by million due primarily to the utilization of net operating loss carryforwards million and a reduction of deferred temporary tax timing differences million 
accounts receivable  net of reserves  decreased by million in primarily due to lower sales 
cash provided by investing activities was million in  down from million provided in capital expenditure remained flat at approximately million 
the principal factor that contributed to the cash provided by investing activities was the proceeds from maturities of short term investments 
cash used in financing activities was million in  down from million used in the principal factor that contributed to the cash used in financing activities was the cash used to repurchase million shares and million shares of visx stock on the open market in and  respectively 
on april   our board of directors authorized a new stock repurchase program under which up to million shares of visx common stock may be repurchased 
before repurchasing shares we consider a number of factors including market conditions  the market price of the stock  and the number of shares needed for employee benefit plans 
as a result  we cannot predict the number of shares that we may repurchase in the future 
purchases of short term investments represent reinvestment into short term investments of the proceeds from short term investments that matured and investment of cash and cash equivalents 
as of december   we did not have any borrowings outstanding nor any credit agreements 
our normal credit terms granted to customers are net to days 
in an effort to promote the growth of the laser vision correction industry and the use of visx star systems  in certain markets we provide long term financing to customers for their purchase of visx systems 
we consider a number of factors including industry practice  competition  and our evaluation of customers credit worthiness in determining when to offer such financing 
we believe that our operations will provide sufficient cash flow to meet our working capital and capital equipment needs during the coming twelve months 
in addition  we have million of cash  cash equivalents  and short term investments as of december  to provide for unforeseen contingencies and to support strategic objectives including the development or acquisition of new technologies and our stock repurchase program 
in august  we signed a one year research and development agreement with medjet inc medjet under which we provided funding to medjet to pursue new ophthalmic technologies and products 
in addition  we signed a merger agreement with medjet that provided us with a one year option  for which we paid million  to acquire all outstanding medjet common stock in a merger transaction for per share in cash 
during the third quarter of fiscal  our agreements with medjet were amended to provide us with up to an additional eleven months to acquire all 
table of contents outstanding medjet common stock in a merger transaction for per share in cash 
the closing of the potential merger was subject to medjet s stockholder approval and to other customary conditions to closing 
in august  we also paid million to purchase from a third party all outstanding shares of medjet s series b convertible preferred stock  which are entitled to votes equivalent to  shares of medjet common stock and vote together with medjet s common stock 
these shares owned by visx represent of medjet s voting stock 
we account for this investment under the equity method prescribed by accounting principles board no 
 the equity method of accounting for investments in common stock 
in connection with these agreements  we also entered into a voting agreement with dr 
eugene gordon  founder of medjet  under which dr 
gordon agreed to vote all of his shares of common stock in favor of the merger  and agreed to sell all of his stock to visx in the event that visx offered to complete the merger 
additionally  visx acquired warrants from medjet to purchase  shares of medjet common stock exercisable at per share 
visx also acquired warrants from a third party to purchase  shares of medjet common stock exercisable at per share 
the warrants expire during the second half of under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  the warrants are treated as derivatives and measured at fair value 
at each balance sheet date  the warrants are remeasured at fair value and all gains and losses are recorded in the statements of operations 
under our r d agreement with medjet  we paid approximately million and million to medjet to fund research and development work they performed during and  respectively 
we expensed payments made to medjet as research  development  and regulatory expense in our financial statements 
in november  visx terminated its merger and research and development agreements with medjet 
in accordance with these agreements  visx paid medjet termination fees of  in the fourth quarter 
under generally accepted accounting principles  we are required to review our investment in medjet s series b convertible preferred stock for losses that are other than temporary 
we performed an impairment analysis as a result of the continued decline in market capitalization of medjet common stock 
as a result  we recorded an impairment charge equal to the carrying value of our investment of million in in may  visx announced that it entered into an exclusive worldwide license agreement for a portfolio of patents held by luis ruiz  md  relating to the treatment of presbyopia with multifocal ablations 
visx also signed an agreement with tracey technologies  llc for rights to tracey s ray tracing technology for use in customized laser vision correction treatments 
during  visx made payments of approximately million related to these agreements  which were expensed in if clinical and regulatory milestones specified in both agreements are achieved  visx would be committed to make additional payments of approximately million in connection with these two agreements 
visx could be obligated for royalties in the future based on any future sales of the associated products

the amounts reclassified as a reduction to license and other revenues for and are  and  respectively 
these reclassifications do not change the amount of net income reported for each period  however revenue and expense are reduced in equal and offsetting amounts in each period 
accordingly  the reclassification of the consideration previously reported as selling  general  and administrative expense reduces our gross profit ratio

table of contents risk factors this report contains forward looking statements that involve risk and uncertainty 
the factors set forth below  which are not the only risks we face  may cause our actual results to vary from those contemplated by certain forward looking statements set forth in this report and should be considered carefully in addition to the other information presented in this report 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  results of operations or cash flows could be adversely affected 
our results of operations have varied widely in the past  and they could continue to vary significantly 
in addition  our actual results may differ significantly from the results contemplated by the forward looking statements 
accordingly  we believe that our results of operations in any given period may not be a good indicator of our future performance 
market acceptance 
our business depends upon broad market acceptance of laser vision correction by both doctors and patients in the united states and key international markets 
laser vision correction has penetrated about of the eligible us population  and our profitability and continued growth will be largely dependent on increasing levels of market acceptance and procedure growth both in the united states and internationally 
although laser vision correction offers a more predictable outcome and more precise results than other surgical methods used to correct refractive disorders  it is not without risk 
potential complications and side effects include post operative discomfort  corneal haze an increase in the light scattering properties of the cornea during healing  glare halos undesirable visual sensations produced by bright lights  decreases in contrast sensitivity  temporary increases in intraocular pressure in reaction to procedure medication  modest fluctuations in refractive capabilities during healing  modest decrease in best corrected vision ie  with corrective eyewear  unintended over or under corrections  regression of effect  disorders of corneal healing  corneal scars  corneal ulcers  and induced astigmatism which may result in blurred or double vision and or shadow images 
some consumers may not choose to undergo laser vision correction because of these complications or more general concerns relating to its safety and efficacy and a general resistance to surgery 
alternatively  some consumers may elect to delay undergoing laser vision correction surgery because they believe improved technology and or methods of treatment will be available in the near future 
should either the ophthalmic community or the general population turn away from laser vision correction as an alternative to existing methods of treating refractive vision disorders  or if future technologies replaced laser vision correction  these developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
patents and intellectual property 
our business is dependent on the enforceability and the validity of our united states and foreign patents 
we own over united states and foreign patents and have approximately patent applications pending 
although we are committed to protecting our proprietary technology  it is possible that one or more of our patents will be found to be invalid or unenforceable  or that a party against whom we are asserting claims of patent infringement will be found not to be infringing our patents 
such an outcome could result in  among other things  our inability to sell  license  use or incorporate products that use the challenged technology  increased competition by new or existing competitors or the payment of substantial monetary damages  any of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
competition 
intense competition in the laser vision correction industry could result in the loss of customers  an inability to attract new customers  or a decrease in prices for our products 
the medical device and ophthalmic laser industries are subject to intense competition and technological change 
not only does laser vision correction compete with more traditional vision correction options such as eyeglasses and contact lenses  it also competes with other technologies and surgical techniques such as corneal implants  intraocular lenses  and surgery using different types of lasers 
in addition  the market for laser vision correction systems has become increasingly competitive in recent years as a result of fda approval of several new laser systems 
the visx system competes with products marketed or under development by other laser and medical equipment manufacturers  many of which have greater financial and other resources 
competitors may offer laser systems at a lower price  may price their laser systems as part of a bundle of products or services  may develop procedures that involve a lower per procedure cost  or may offer products perceived as preferable to the visx system 
we also do not currently collect license fees from an unlicensed competitor 
in addition  medical companies  academic and research institutions and others could develop new therapies  including new medical devices or surgical procedures  for the conditions targeted by visx  which therapies could be more medically effective and less expensive than laser vision correction  and could potentially render laser vision correction obsolete 
any such developments could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position and results of operations 
unfavorable side effects 
the possibility of long term side effects and adverse publicity regarding laser correction surgery could seriously harm our business 
laser vision correction is a relatively new procedure 
consequently  there is 
table of contents no long term follow up data beyond ten years  and longer term follow up data might reveal additional complications or unknown side effects 
any future reported side effects  other adverse events or unfavorable publicity involving patient outcomes resulting from the use of laser vision correction systems manufactured by visx or any participant in the laser vision correction market  may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  and results of operations 
economic conditions 
laser vision correction is not subject to reimbursement from third party payors such as insurance companies or government programs  and adverse economic conditions have  and may continue to cause  our revenues to decline 
the costs of laser vision correction are typically borne by individuals directly 
accordingly  individuals may be less willing to incur the procedure cost associated with laser vision correction in weak or uncertain economic conditions  as was evidenced by our decline in revenues from compared to and from compared to any resulting decline in the number of visx star systems sold or laser vision correction procedures performed may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  and results of operations 
loss of significant customers 
if we lose one or more of our significant customers  or if purchases by one or more of our key customers decrease  our net sales may decline and our business could be harmed 
a significant portion of our revenues is derived from sales to tlc vision corporation tlc formed in may through the merger of laser vision centers  inc and tlc laser eye centers  inc  both long term customers of ours 
the combined company  tlc  accounted for  and of our total revenues in  and  respectively 
should we lose a major customer or if anticipated sales to a major customer do not materialize  our business  financial position and results of operations may suffer 
fixed short term expenses 
because our expenses are relatively fixed in the short term  our earnings will decline if we do not meet our projected sales 
any shortfall in revenues below expectations would likely have an immediate impact on our earnings per share  which could adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
our operating expenses  which include sales and marketing  research and development  and general and administrative expenses  are based on our expectations of future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  if revenues fall below expectations  we will not be able to reduce our spending rapidly in response to such a shortfall 
governmental regulation 
we are subject to extensive governmental regulation  which increases our costs and could prevent us from selling our products 
government regulation includes inspection of and controls over research and development  testing  manufacturing  safety and environmental controls  efficacy  labeling  advertising  promotion  pricing  record keeping  the sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products and samples and electronic records and electronic signatures 
in the united states  we must obtain fda approval or clearance for each medical device that we market 
the fda approval process is typically lengthy and expensive  and approval is never certain 
products distributed outside of the united states are also subject to government regulation  which may be equally or more demanding 
our new products could take a significantly longer time than we expect to gain regulatory approval and may never gain approval 
if a regulatory authority delays approval of a potentially significant product  our market value and operating results may decline 
even if the fda or another regulatory agency approves a product  the approval may limit the indicated uses for a product  may otherwise limit our ability to promote  sell and distribute a product or may require post marketing studies 
if we are unable to obtain regulatory approval of our products  we will not be able to market these products  which would result in a decrease in our sales 
currently  we are actively pursuing approval for a number of our products from regulatory authorities in a number of countries  including  among others  the united states  countries in the european union and japan 
in particular  we are awaiting approval from the fda of our pre market application to perform custom lasik in the united states 
continued growth in our sales and profits will depend  in part  on the timely and successful introduction and marketing of some or all of these products 
the clinical trials required to obtain regulatory approvals are complex and expensive and their outcomes are uncertain 
we incur substantial expense for  and devote significant time to  clinical trials  yet cannot be certain that the trials will ever result in the commercial sale of a product 
we may suffer significant setbacks in clinical trials  even after earlier clinical trials show promising results 
any of our products may produce undesirable side effects that could cause us or regulatory authorities to interrupt  delay or halt clinical trials of a product candidate 
we  the fda  or another regulatory authority may suspend or terminate clinical trials at any time if they or we believe the trial participants face unacceptable health risks 
noncompliance with applicable united states regulatory requirements can result in fines  injunctions  penalties  mandatory recalls or seizures  suspensions of production  denial or withdrawal of pre marketing approvals  recommendations by the fda against governmental contracts and criminal prosecution 
the fda also has authority to 
table of contents request repair  replacement  or refund of the cost of any device we manufacture or distribute 
regulatory authorities outside of the united states may impose similar sanctions for noncompliance with applicable regulatory requirements 
new products may not be commercially viable 
our research and development may not lead to new products that achieve commercial success 
we devote significant resources to research and development 
the research and development process is expensive  prolonged  and entails considerable uncertainty 
development of a new product  from discovery through testing and registration to initial product launch  typically takes between three and seven years for a medical device 
each of these periods varies considerably from product to product and country to country 
because of the complexities and uncertainties associated with ophthalmic research and development  products we are currently developing may not complete the development process or obtain the regulatory approvals required to market such products successfully 
the products currently in our development pipeline may not be approved by regulatory entities and may not be commercially successful  and our current and planned products could be surpassed by more effective or advanced products 
international operations 
we face risks due to our reliance on sales in international markets 
our future success will depend in part on the continued expansion of our international sales and operations 
in particular  during   and  we derived approximately  and  respectively  of our revenues from sales to customers outside the united states 
our growing international presence exposes us to risks including the need for export licenses  unexpected regulatory requirements  tariffs and other potential trade barriers and restrictions  political  legal and economic instability in foreign markets  longer accounts receivable cycles  difficulties in managing operations across disparate geographic areas  foreign currency fluctuations  reduced or limited protection of our intellectual property rights in some countries  and dependence on local distributors 
if one or more of these risks materialize  our sales to international customers may decrease and our costs may increase  which could negatively impact our revenues and operating results 
intellectual property disputes 
the laser vision correction industry has been the subject of substantial litigation  both in the united states and internationally  specifically focusing on patents and proprietary rights 
other companies own united states and foreign patents covering methods and apparatus for performing corneal surgery with ultraviolet lasers 
if we were found to infringe our competitors patents  we could be subject to significant monetary liability and we could be enjoined from distributing our products 
moreover  it is possible that one or more of our patents may be found to be invalid or unenforceable  or that a party against whom we are asserting claims of patent infringement may be found not to be infringing our patents 
in that event  our ability to collect license fees from the parties to the litigation or from other sellers or users of laser vision correction equipment in the united states may suffer and our revenues may decline 
any one of these results could harm our business 
settlement negotiations with nidek 
on march   visx and nidek signed a term sheet outlining a global litigation settlement and patent cross license 
the settlement outlined in the term sheet will resolve all litigation between the parties worldwide  including all of the parties patent and antitrust lawsuits in the united states 
the settlement also will involve a worldwide cross license of certain of the parties respective patents  and a payment by visx to nidek of million for the settlement of nidek s antitrust and related claims 
we expect that this payment will be more than offset by future savings realized from the avoidance of legal fees 

table of contents the settlement and cross license will not become effective until the signing of a final written agreement  which is currently being drafted 
upon the signing of the agreement  the parties will submit requests for dismissal of the lawsuits to the appropriate courts for approval 
however  if the parties fail to effect a final settlement  the litigation described above will continue 
in that event  we are unable to predict either the outcome or estimate the potential adverse financial and operational impact  if any  that might arise from these cases 
adverse determinations in these lawsuits could limit our ability to collect per procedure license fees in the united states from sellers and users of laser vision correction systems  could give rise to significant monetary damages and could result in an order enjoining the manufacture and sale of the visx star system 
any such adverse determination could therefore have a material adverse effect on visx s business  financial position and future results of operations 
product liability claims 
we have and may become subject to product liability claims 
we could be liable for injuries or damage resulting from use of the visx star system or wavescan system 
in addition  a claim that an injury resulted from a defect in any visx product  even if successfully defended  could damage our reputation 
although we possess insurance customarily obtained by businesses of our type including insurance against product liability risks associated with the testing  manufacturing  and marketing of our products  product liability claims in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial position  and results of operations 
single sources for key components 
the manufacture of visx star systems and wavescan systems is a complex operation involving numerous procedures 
we depend on single and limited sources for several key components 
if any of these suppliers were to cease providing components  we would be required to locate and contract with a substitute supplier 
we could have difficulty identifying a substitute supplier in a timely manner or on commercially reasonable terms 
if the production of our products  parts and services were interrupted or could not continue in a cost effective or timely manner  our business  financial position  and results of operations  could be materially adversely affected 
volatility of our stock price 
the market price of our common stock has experienced fluctuations and is likely to fluctuate significantly in the future 
our stock price can fluctuate for a number of reasons  including announcements about us or our competitors  results or settlements of any litigation  quarterly variations in operating results  the introduction or abandonment of new technologies or products  changes in product pricing policies by us or our competitors  and changes in earnings estimates by analysts or changes in accounting policies 
economic changes and political uncertainties in addition  stock markets have experienced significant price and volume volatility in recent years 
this volatility has had a substantial effect on the market prices of securities of many public companies for reasons frequently unrelated or disproportionate to the operating performance of the specific companies 
in addition  the securities of many medical device companies  including visx  have historically been subject to extensive price and volume fluctuations that may affect the market price of their common stock 
if these broad market fluctuations continue  they may adversely affect the market price of our common stock 
confidentiality agreements 
we rely on confidentiality agreements to protect our proprietary technology 
we protect our proprietary technology  in part  through confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements with employees  consultants and other parties 
our confidentiality agreements with employees and consultants generally contain standard provisions requiring those individuals to assign to us  without additional consideration  inventions conceived or reduced to practice by them while employed or retained by us  subject to customary exceptions 
if any of our employees  consultants or others breach these confidentiality agreements  we may not have adequate remedies for any breach  and our competitors may learn of our trade secrets 
new technologies 
if we fail to keep pace with advances in our industry or fail to develop new methods of vision correction  customers may not buy our products and our revenue may decline 
we must be able to manufacture and 
table of contents effectively market those products and persuade a sufficient number of eye care professionals to use the new products we introduce 
sales of our existing products may decline rapidly if a new product is introduced by one of our competitors or if we announce a new product that  in either case  represents a substantial improvement over our existing products 
a decrease in procedure volume may also occur if consumers elect to delay undergoing laser vision correction surgery because they believe improved technology and or methods of treatment will be available in the near future 
antitakeover provisions in our charter documents 
in  we adopted a stockholder rights plan  which we subsequently amended in the presence of this plan could make it more difficult for a third party to engage in a takeover attempt  even a takeover attempt in which the potential purchaser offers to pay a per share price greater than the current market price for our common stock 
in addition  the presence of the plan could delay or impede the removal of incumbent directors 
these provisions may also impact the amount of interest investors have in our business 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we invest our cash  beyond that needed for daily operations  in high quality debt securities 
we seek primarily to preserve the value and liquidity of our capital  and secondarily to safely earn income from these investments 
to accomplish these goals  we invest only in debt securities issued by the us treasury and us government agencies and corporations and us corporations that meet the following criteria rated investment grade a or higher by the major rating services  can readily be resold for cash  and mature no more than years from our date of purchase 
the following table shows the expected cash flows at maturity from our investments in debt securities s 
beyond cash equivalents and short term investments amortized cost as of december  weighted average effective interest rate foreign currency exchange rate risk 
we sell products in various international markets 
virtually all of these sales are contracted and paid for in us dollars 
as of december  we have no outstanding foreign currency hedge contracts 
accordingly  we have no material foreign currency exchange risk as of december
