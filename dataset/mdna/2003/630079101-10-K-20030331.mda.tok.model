overview from its inception in november through december   the company was in the development stage 
during that period  the company primarily focused on the development of its manufacturing processes in order to transition from laboratory scale to commercial scale production 
as a result  the company developed an operating capacity to produce significant quantities of its nanocrystalline materials for commercial sale 
the company was also engaged in the development of commercial applications and formulations and the recruiting of marketing  technical and administrative personnel 
since january   the company has been engaged in commercial production and sales of its nanocrystalline materials  and the company no longer considers itself in the development stage 
from inception through december   the company was primarily capitalized through the private offering of approximately million of equity securities and its initial public offering of million of common stock in november of and million of common stock in a private placement offering in may of  each net of issuance costs 
the company has incurred cumulative losses of million from inception through december  critical accounting policies we utilize certain accounting measurements under applicable generally accepted accounting principles  which involve the exercise of management s judgment about subjective factors and estimates about the effect of matters which are inherently uncertain 
the following is a summary of those accounting measurements which we believe are most critical to our reported results of operations and financial condition 
our significant accounting policies are more fully described in note to our financial statements 
revenue recognition 
product revenue consists of sales of product that are recognized when realized and earned 
this generally occurs when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred  the price is fixed or determinable  and collectibility is reasonably assured 
other revenue consists of revenue from research and development arrangements with non governmental entities  fees from the transfer of technology and  principally  for the years through  related royalties 
research and development arrangements include both cost plus and fixed fee agreements and such revenue is recognized when specific milestones are met under the arrangements 
fees related to the transfer of technology are recognized when the transfer of technology to the acquiring party is completed and the company has no further significant obligation 
royalties are recognized when earned pursuant to the contractual arrangement 
inventory valuation 
cost is determined on a first in  first out basis 
inventory is stated at the lower of cost  maintained on a first in  first out basis  or market 
the company has recorded allowances to reduce inventory relating to excess quantities of certain materials 
write downs of inventories establish a new cost basis  which is not increased for future increases in market value of inventories or changes in estimated excess quantities 
trade accounts receivable 
trade accounts receivable are carried at original invoice amount less an estimate made for doubtful receivables based on a review of all outstanding amounts on a monthly basis 
management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by identifying troubled accounts and by using historical experience applied to an aging of accounts 
trade accounts receivable are written off when deemed uncollectible 
recoveries of trade accounts receivable previously written off are recorded when received 
results of operations years ended december  and total revenue increased to  in  compared to  in the increase in total revenue between and was mainly attributed to growth with existing customers  particularly  an increase of approximately in total product derived from the company s largest customer 
product revenue increased to  in  compared to  in other revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in the majority of the revenue generated during was from customers in the healthcare  wear resistant materials  chemical mechanical planarization cmp and catalyst markets 
revenue from basf and cik  the company s two largest customers constituted approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenue 
cost of revenue generally includes costs associated with commercial production and customer development arrangements 
cost of revenue increased to  in  compared to  in the increase in cost of revenue was generally attributed to increased product sales volume and increased depreciation expense resulting from the completion  and placement in service at the beginning of the current year and throughout the current year of the majority of the company s build out of its manufacturing and powder coating facilities  somewhat offset by efficiencies in the manufacture of the company s products 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue decreased from in  compared to in improvements to gross profit are primarily due to increased revenues  continued gains in operating efficiencies  and nonrecurring other revenue in the amount of  received in the second quarter 
for the year  the company recognized a contribution of approximately  due to inventory being sold for which an allowance for excess inventory quantities had previously been recorded 
the company expects to remain operating at a positive annual gross profit margin for the foreseeable future 
research and development expense  which includes all expenses relating to the technology and advanced engineering groups  primarily consists of costs associated with the company s development or acquisition of new product applications and coating formulations and the cost of enhancing the company s manufacturing processes 
the company is currently engaged in research to enhance its ability to disperse its material in a variety of organic and inorganic media for use as coatings and polishing materials 
a recent technical success was related to the company s ability to engineer some of its nanomaterials to remain relatively uniformly dispersed in liquid systems over extended periods of time 
the company s june announcement regarding its new cmp partner  rodel  came about as a direct result of this successful research and subsequent application development 
the company also has an ongoing advanced engineering effort that is primarily focused on the development of new nanomaterials as well as the refinement of existing nanomaterials 
research and development expense decreased to  in  compared to  in the decreases in research and development expense was largely attributed to decreased outside testing  materials and supplies  and travel expenses being incurred in these reductions were somewhat offset by increased depreciation on assets completed and placed in service during  increased advanced engineering salaries due to lower capitalization of payroll approximately  in than in approximately  and increased spending on electricity and equipment expenses 
selling  general and administrative expense increased to  in  compared to  in the net increase was primarily attributed to increases in salary expenses incurred relating to the hiring of a company executive  legal costs  real estate taxes  and bad debt expense which  was zero at december   compared to a credit balance at december  these increases were partially offset by a reduction in investor relations  telephone  consulting fees  and travel expenditures

years ended december  and total revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease in total revenue between and was principally due to soft customer demand and extended times to market given the general state of the manufacturing economy  exacerbated by the terrorist attack on the united states of america on september  product revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in other revenue decreased to  in  compared to  in revenue from basf and cik  the company s two largest customers constituted approximately and  respectively  of the company s revenue 
cost of revenue generally includes costs associated with commercial production  customer development arrangements and licensing fees 
cost of revenue increased to  in  compared to  in the increase in cost of revenue was primarily attributed to a net increase in the allowance for excess inventory quantities of  somewhat offset by efficiencies in the manufacture of the company s products 
the majority of the increase in the allowance for excess inventory quantities related to a write down of raw materials and finished goods relating to the company s catalyst business 
these inventories were built in support of a purchase order and in anticipation of upcoming order volumes from a customer in the united kingdom that subsequently reneged on its legal obligations 
management felt that  although nanophase has a current customer for this material  current volumes and limited predictability of future demand made this adjustment prudent 
cost of revenue as a percentage of total revenue increased in  compared to the same period in  due primarily to the inventory adjustment discussed above 
research and development expense  which includes all expenses relating to the technology and advanced engineering groups  primarily consists of costs associated with the company s development or acquisition of new product applications and coating formulations and the cost of enhancing the company s manufacturing processes 
research and development expense decreased to  in  compared to  in the decrease in research and development expense was largely attributed to the capitalization of approximately  of advanced engineering salaries attributed to the build out of the company s new pilot manufacturing and powder coating facilities  a reduction in fees and expenses paid to outside consultants in  more research personnel being hired in  to whom the company paid negotiated bonuses and recruiting and relocation costs  and fewer travel expenses being incurred in selling  general and administrative expense increased to  in  compared to  in the net increase was primarily attributed to increases in salaries and costs incurred relating to the hiring of two company employees  costs of insurance  rent and associated expenses relating to the company s new facility  and printing costs 
these increases were partially offset by a reduction in bad debt expense  consulting fees  and travel expenditures

net cash used in investing activities  which is due to net investment activity for held to maturity investments and capital expenditures  amounted to  for the year ended december  compared to  and  of net cash provided by investing activities for the years ended december  and  respectively 
capital expenditures  primarily related to the build out of the company s new pilot manufacturing and powder blending facilities within its romeoville  illinois facility and further expansion of the company s existing manufacturing facility and the purchase of related operating equipment  amounted to  this amount included  in non cash items incurred for accounts payable relating to capital expenditures and  in capital lease obligations incurred for use of equipment for the year ended december  compared to  including  in non cash items incurred for accounts payable relating to capital expenditures and  in capital lease obligations incurred for use of equipment for the year ended december   and  for the year ended december  net cash provided by financing activities  is primarily due to the company securing financing through a private placement in and other financing agreements  and to a lesser extent by the issuance of shares of common stock pursuant to the exercise of options and warrants  partially offset by principal payments on debt and capital lease obligations  amounting to  for the year ended december   compared to  and  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
on may   the company secured equity funding through a private placement offering 
the company issued million shares of additional common stock at per share and received gross proceeds of million 
net proceeds were approximately million after commissions  legal  accounting  and other costs 
the company intends to use the proceeds to fund expected growth in new markets as well as to provide for expanded working capital needs expected to arise as sales volume grows 
the company s supply agreement with its largest customer contains several financial covenants which could potentially impact the company s liquidity 
the most restrictive financial covenants under this agreement require the company to maintain a minimum of million in cash and investments  and no more than million in debt  in order to avoid an event which could trigger a transfer of technology and equipment to the company s largest customer in the event that the company s cash  cash equivalents and investment balances drop below million 
the company had approximately million in cash and investments and debt of less than million at december  management expects that the proceeds received from the may  private placement offering should be sufficient to enable the company to comply with these financial covenants for at least the next twelve months 
this supply agreement and its covenants are more fully described in note of the company s financial statements 
the company believes that cash from operations and cash  cash equivalents and investments on hand  together with the remaining net proceeds from the company s initial public offering of common stock the offering  and with its most recent funding received through a private placement offering  and interest income thereon  will be adequate to fund the company s operating plans for the next twelve months 
the company s actual future capital requirements will depend  however  on many factors  including customer acceptance of the company s current and potential nanocrystalline materials and product applications  continued progress in the company s research and development activities and product testing programs  the magnitude of these activities and programs  and the costs necessary to increase and expand the company s manufacturing capabilities and to market and sell the company s materials and product applications 
other important issues that will drive future capital requirements will be the development of new markets and new customers as well as the potential for significant unplanned growth with the company s existing customers 
the company expects capital spending in to be approximately  of which  relates to payments of accounts payable incurred in but not payable until the following table highlights the company s contractual obligations contractual obligations payments due by period total less than year years years more than years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases totals at december   the company had a net operating loss carryforward of approximately million for income tax purposes 
because the company may have experienced ownership changes within the meaning of the us internal revenue code in connection with its various prior equity offerings  future utilization of this carryforward may be subject to certain limitations as defined by the internal revenue code 
if not utilized  the carryforward expires at various dates between and as a result of the annual limitation and uncertainty as to the amount of future taxable income that will be earned prior to the expiration of the carryforward  the company has concluded that it is likely that some portion of this carryforward will expire before ultimately becoming available to reduce income tax liabilities 
at december   the company also had a foreign tax credit carryforward of  which could be used as an offsetting tax credit to reduce us income taxes 
the foreign tax credit will expire at various dates between and  if not utilized before that date 
should events arise that make it appropriate for the company to seek additional financing  it should be noted that additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms or at all  and any such additional financing could be dilutive to the company s stockholders 
such a financing could be necessitated by such things as  the loss of existing customers  currently unknown capital requirements which may be needed to retain existing business or remain competitive in the seeking of new business  new regulatory requirements that are outside the company s control  or various other circumstances coming to pass that are currently not anticipated by the company
