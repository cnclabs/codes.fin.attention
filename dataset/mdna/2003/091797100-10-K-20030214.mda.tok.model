net earnings for the year ended december   included a pre tax restructuring charge of million million net of tax 
net earnings for the year ended december   included a pre tax restructuring charge of million million net of tax 
excluding the impact of the and restructuring charges  and  for  goodwill amortization  net earnings for the year ended december   would have been million  or per share on a diluted basis  compared to net earnings of million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the year ended december  in the discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations that follows  the corporation generally attempts to list contributing factors in order of significance to the point being addressed 
sales the following chart provides an analysis of the consolidated changes in sales for the years ended december    and year ended december  dollars in millions total sales    unit volume price currency change in total sales total consolidated sales for the year ended december   were  million  which represented a increase over sales of  million 
total unit volume had a positive impact on sales during compared to the increase in unit volume was primarily attributable to higher unit volume in both the power tools and accessories and security hardware businesses in north america as well as unit volume increases in sales to automotive customers by the fastening and assembly systems segment 
these increases were partially offset by unit volume declines in the plumbing products and european security hardware businesses 
pricing actions  taken as a result of customer and competitive pressure  had a negative effect on sales for as compared to the effect of a weaker us dollar compared to certain other foreign currencies  particularly the euro and the pound sterling  caused a increase in the corporation s consolidated sales during over the prior year level 
total consolidated sales for the year ended december   were  million  which represented a decrease from sales of  million 
total unit volume had a negative impact on sales during compared to the prior year 
unit volume was negatively affected by weak economic conditions and inventory reductions by retailers in the united states 
the impact of these negative factors was partially offset by incremental sales of businesses acquired by the corporation 
pricing actions taken in response to customer and competitive pressures  as well as to reduce the corporation s inventory levels  had a negative effect on sales for as compared to the negative effects of a stronger dollar compared to other foreign currencies  particularly the euro  pound sterling  and brazilian real  caused a decrease in the corporation s consolidated sales during from the prior year level 
earnings the corporation reported consolidated operating income of million on sales of  million in  compared to operating income of million on sales of  million in and to operating income of million on sales of  million in consolidated operating income for included a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
consolidated operating income for included a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
consolidated operating income for included a pre tax restructuring charge of million and a pre tax gain on sale of business of million 
that gain was recognized in connection with the sale during of a million senior increasing rate discount note  payable by true temper corporation  received in connection with the september recapitalization of the corporation s recreational products business  true temper sports  as well as the corporation s remaining interest in true temper corporation 
operating income for the years ended december  and  included goodwill amortization of million and million  respectively 
no goodwill amortization is included in the results due to a change in accounting standards 
excluding these unusual items and the amortization of goodwill in and  consolidated operating income as a percentage of sales would have been in  in  and in consolidated gross margin as a percentage of sales for was as compared to for the increase in gross margin in was attributable to several positive factors that included i higher productivity  including six sigma productivity initiatives  ii higher production levels as the corporation returned to more normal production levels in its power tools and accessories business in  after lowering production levels in to reduce inventories  iii more favorable product mix  and iv savings associated with restructuring actions 
these positive factors more than offset the cost of end user promotional programs as well as pricing actions taken by the corporation as a result of customer and competitive pressure 
consolidated gross margin as a percentage of sales for was compared to for while the results of the corporation s six sigma and other productivity initiatives positively impacted gross margin in  other negative factors offset that favorability 
those negative factors included i pricing actions taken by the corporation in response to both customer and competitive pressures  as well as price reductions to increase sales of certain inventories  and ii lower manufacturing volumes  as the corporation took actions to reduce its inventory levels  which resulted in unfavorable manufacturing overhead absorption as well as reduced productivity 
consolidated selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales were in  compared to in and in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for the years ended december  and  would have been and  respectively  using the new accounting standard for goodwill 
excluding goodwill amortization recognized in  selling  general  and administrative expenses for rose  as compared to  as the corporation increased its reserves for certain environmental remediation matters and recognized greater employee related expenses 
the increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales from to was primarily due to lower sales in  partially offset by the favorable impact of cost containment initiatives and certain variable expenses 
consolidated net interest expense interest expense less interest income was million in  compared to million in and million in the lower net interest expense in  as compared to  resulted from both lower borrowing levels and lower interest rates 
the lower net interest expense for compared to was primarily the result of lower interest rates 
other expense income was million in compared to million in and million in the increase in other expense in was primarily the result of dividends on a subsidiary s preferred shares as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
consolidated income tax expense of million  million  and million was recognized on the corporation s pre tax income of million  million  and million for  and  respectively 
excluding  for  the income tax benefit of million relating to the pre tax restructuring charge of million and  for  the income tax benefit of million relating to the pre tax restructuring charge of million  and  for  the income tax benefits of million related to the pre tax restructuring charge of million and the income tax expense of million related to the pre tax gain on sale of business of million  the corporation s reported tax rate would have been in and in and the reduction in the effective tax rate during  excluding the income tax benefit associated with the restructuring charge  is attributable to the amortization of non deductible goodwill in a further analysis of taxes on earnings is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the corporation reported net earnings of million  million  and million  or   and per share on a diluted basis  for the years ended december    and  respectively 
net earnings include the effects of after tax restructuring charge of million  million  and million in   and  respectively  and the after tax gain on sale of business of million in net earnings for the years ended december  and  included million and million  respectively  of goodwill amortization 
no goodwill amortization is included in the results due to a change in accounting standards 
excluding the restructuring charges for   and  goodwill amortization for and  and the gain on sale of business in  net earnings for the year ended december   would have been million  or per share on a diluted basis  compared to million  or per share on a diluted basis  and million  or per share on a diluted basis  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
in addition to the impact of the operational matters previously described  earnings per share for  as compared to  also benefited from lower shares outstanding as a result of a stock repurchase program 
business segments as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation operates in three reportable business segments power tools and accessories  hardware and home improvement  and fastening and assembly systems 
power tools and accessories segment sales and profit for the power tools and accessories segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers    segment profit sales to unaffiliated customers in the power tools and accessories segment during increased over the level 
in north america  sales of consumer power tools and accessories and sales of professional power tools and accessories grew at a mid single digit rate 
the consumer business experienced double digit rates of growth in sales of both its outdoor and home products lines and a low single digit rate of growth in sales of consumer power tools 
both the consumer and professional businesses in north america benefited from promotional activities during sales of power tools and accessories in europe during decreased at a low single digit rate from the level 
that decrease resulted as a mid single digit rate of increase in sales of professional power tools and accessories was offset by a mid single digit rate of decline in sales of consumer products 
lower sales in germany and the united kingdom were partially offset by higher sales in most other european countries 
the sales declines in germany and the united kingdom were mainly driven by lower sales of consumer products  due to the exit of the lawnmower product line in the united kingdom and to the high level of private label asian sourced inventory held by retailers early in sales in other geographic areas increased at a mid single digit rate in over the levels as sales of professional power tools and accessories and consumer power tools and accessories increased at a mid single digit rate 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the power tools and accessories segment was for compared to in the increase in segment profit as a percentage of sales during was driven by higher gross margins and by slightly lower selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
the higher gross margins principally resulted from higher production levels in as compared to the lower levels experienced in the corresponding period in when the business took actions to reduce inventory levels  savings gained through six sigma initiatives and restructuring actions  more favorable product mix  and a decrease in warranty costs 
gross margins in were also depressed by price reductions taken by the business in order to reduce inventory levels 
segment profit as a percentage of sales during also increased due to the leverage of selling  general  and administrative expenses over the higher sales volume 
selling  general  and administrative expenses increased in from the levels due to increased marketing and promotional expenses and higher employee related costs  which were partially offset by restructuring savings and other cost reduction initiatives 
sales to unaffiliated customers in the power tools and accessories segment during decreased from the level 
in north america  sales of power tools and accessories during decreased at a low single digit rate from the level  with sales declines experienced in both professional and consumer power tools and accessories 
those declines were mainly driven by unfavorable economic conditions in the united states and actions taken by certain major customers to reduce inventory levels 
these negative factors were partially offset by incremental sales of professional power tools associated with two businesses acquired in june and december of sales in europe during decreased at a mid single digit rate from the level  driven by a double digit rate of decline in sales of both outdoor products and consumer power tools 
these declines were partially offset by a mid single digit rate of growth in sales of professional power tools 
sales of outdoor products and consumer power tools were negatively impacted during by slowing economic conditions  particularly in germany and the united kingdom  coupled with inventory actions by retailers with high levels of private label asian products 
the growth in professional power tools during resulted  in part  from the transition from the elu r to the dewalt r brand in europe 
sales in other geographic areas increased at a high single digit rate in from the level  as higher sales were achieved in professional power tools  consumer power tools and outdoor products 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the power tools and accessories segment was for compared to in the declines in segment profit during were driven by lower gross margins as a percentage of sales resulting from the corporation s actions to reduce inventory  including price reductions and lower production levels  which resulted in unfavorable manufacturing absorption and slightly higher selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
the higher expenses as a percentage of sales reflected decreased promotional spending offset by higher distribution  transportation  and information systems expenses 
hardware and home improvement segment sales and profit for the hardware and home improvement segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers segment profit sales to unaffiliated customers in the hardware and home improvement segment for decreased from the level 
sales of security hardware in north america grew at a high single digit rate over the level due primarily to the success of the brand and product repositioning introduced in north american home centers in late and to other customers in that increase was offset by a double digit rate of decline in sales of plumbing products  due primarily to the effects of a loss of shelf space at the home depot  lower sales in non home center channels  and a high single digit rate of decline in sales of european security hardware 
as a result of a line review in  the corporation s plumbing products business lost significant shelf space at the home depot 
after the transition  which was substantially complete by the end of  the plumbing products business retained shelf space at the home depot stores in the western united states but lost shelf space at the home depot stores in the central and eastern united states 
that loss of shelf space negatively impacted plumbing product sales by approximately million in the corporation expects that the loss of shelf space at the home depot will negatively impact plumbing product sales by approximately million on an annual basis 
while the plumbing products business is taking action to mitigate the impact of this sales loss  the corporation believes that profitability of its plumbing products business will be adversely affected 
because the corporation has goodwill associated with the plumbing products business  a sustained reduction in the future cash flows of that business beyond that currently anticipated could result in a non cash write down of goodwill 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the hardware and home improvement segment declined to in from in that decrease in segment profit as a percentage of sales was principally due to declines in gross margins which were only partially offset by lower selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
those declines in gross margins resulted from lower production levels at north american security hardware and plumbing product plants  as those businesses took action to reduce inventory levels  and from lower production volumes in european security hardware plants in response to lower sales 
in addition  gross margins were negatively impacted by costs related to restructuring activities in the plumbing products business 
lower selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales for principally resulted from restructuring actions that were taken in to reduce headcount and reduced promotional spending 
sales to unaffiliated customers in the hardware and home improvement segment decreased by for from the level 
sales of security hardware in north america decreased at a high single digit rate  with sales decreasing in both the retail and construction channels 
sales of plumbing products decreased at a low double digit rate  with sales decreasing more significantly in the retail channels 
sales in the retail channels were impacted by the weak retail environment and inventory correction actions taken by retailers  and the continuing effects of a line review conducted in by a major customer 
sales of security hardware in europe were flat as compared to the prior year level 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the hardware and home improvement segment was for compared to for segment profit as a percentage of sales in was negatively impacted by a mid single digit decline in gross margins and a slight increase in selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of sales 
the decrease in gross margins for  was primarily a result of manufacturing inefficiencies and costs associated with manufacturing transition issues in the north american security hardware business and with lower production volumes of north american security hardware and plumbing products 
selling  general  and administrative expenses in the hardware and home improvement segment decreased slightly in  however  these expenses increased as a percentage of sales given the reduced sales in fastening and assembly systems segment sales and profit for the fastening and assembly systems segment  determined on the basis described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  were as follows in millions of dollars year ended december  sales to unaffiliated customers segment profit sales to unaffiliated customers in the fastening and assembly systems segment increased in over incremental sales associated with a distribution business acquired in april accounted for percentage points of the sales growth realized 
a double digit rate of increase in sales to automotive customers  including the effect of the business acquired in april  was partially offset by a mid single digit rate of decline in sales to industrial customers  particularly in europe 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the fastening and assembly systems segment of in approximated the level 
sales to unaffiliated customers in the fastening and assembly systems segment for declined  as compared to  due to a double digit rate decrease in sales to industrial customers offset by a high single digit rate of growth in automotive product sales  including incremental sales associated with a business acquired in april  and a mid single digit rate of growth of sales in asia 
segment profit as a percentage of sales for the fastening and assembly systems segment was for compared to for the decline in segment profit as a percentage of sales for was principally due to declines in gross margin as a percentage of sales resulting from unfavorable mix  due to lower margins in the distribution business acquired in april  and pricing pressure 
other segment related matters expenses directly related to reportable business segments booked in consolidation and  thus  excluded from segment profit for the reportable business segments were million  
million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the million of segment related expenses excluded from segment profit in principally related to reserves for employee related matters associated with the power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments 
the million of segment related expenses excluded from segment profit in principally related to reserves for certain legal matters associated with the power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments and for the elimination of the power tools and accessories segment s recognition of profit from a joint venture until such time as inventory purchased from that joint venture has been sold to external customers 
amounts allocated to reportable business segments in arriving at segment profit were less than corporate center operating expenses  eliminations  and other amounts  as identified in the second table included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  by million  million  and million for the years ended december    and  respectively 
the increase in these unallocated corporate center operating expenses for as compared to was primarily due to an increase in reserves for certain environmental remediation matters and to higher employee related expenses  including certain centrally managed expenses not allocated directly to the corporation s business segments 
the increase in these unallocated corporate center operating expenses for as compared to was primarily due to higher employee related expenses  including certain centrally managed expenses not allocated directly to the corporation s business segments 
as indicated above and in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the determination of segment profit excludes restructuring and exit costs 
of the million pre tax restructuring charge recognized in  million related to the businesses in the power tools and accessories segment  and million related to the businesses in the hardware and home improvement segment 
of the million pre tax restructuring charge recognized in  million related to the businesses in the power tools and accessories segment  million related to businesses in the hardware and home improvement segment  and 
million related to businesses in the fastening and assembly systems segment 
of the million pre tax restructuring charge recognized in  million related to businesses in the power tools and accessories segment and million related to businesses in the hardware and home improvement segment 
restructuring actions the corporation is committed to continuous productivity improvement and continues to evaluate opportunities to reduce fixed costs  simplify or improve processes  and eliminate excess capacity 
a tabular summary of restructuring activity during the three years ended december   is included in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
during the fourth quarter of  the corporation formulated a restructuring plan designed to reduce its manufacturing footprint  variable production costs  and selling  general  and administrative expenses 
the corporation initially anticipated that the cost of the total restructuring plan expected to be completed over a two to three year period would be million 
during and  the corporation has recognized pre tax restructuring charges that total million 
the corporation currently anticipates that the cost of the total restructuring plan will approximate million and is expected to be completed during during  the corporation commenced the first phase of that restructuring plan and recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
that million charge was net of million of reversals of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required 
during  the corporation continued to execute its restructuring plans and recorded a pre tax restructuring charge of million 
that million charge was net of million of reversals of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required 
the million pre tax restructuring charge recognized in reflects actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base in its power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments  as well as actions to reduce selling  general  and administrative expenses through the elimination of administrative positions  principally in europe 
actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base in the power tools and accessories segment include the closure of one facility in the united states  the closure of an accessories packaging facility in england  and the transfer of certain additional power tool production from a facility in england to a low cost facility in the czech republic 
actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base in the hardware and home improvement segment include the closure of a security hardware facility in the united states 
the restructuring charge also includes pension curtailment losses stemming from headcount reductions associated with the restructuring actions 
the million pre tax restructuring charge recognized in reflected actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base in its power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments  as well as actions to reduce selling  general  and administrative expenses throughout all of its businesses 
actions to reduce the corporation s manufacturing cost base included the closure of two facilities in the power tools and accessories segment in the united states as well as the closure by the hardware and home improvement segment of a plumbing products facility in the united states 
in addition  actions associated with the restructuring charge included the transfer of certain production and service operations in the power tools and accessories and hardware and home improvement segments from facilities in the united states and england to low cost facilities in mexico and china and to a new low cost facility in the czech republic 
in addition to these changes to the corporation s manufacturing footprint  the restructuring plan also provided for the outsourcing of certain manufactured items 
the restructuring charge provided for actions to reduce selling  general  and administrative expenses  principally in the united states and europe  including consolidation of certain distribution locations and other administrative functions  as well as reductions in selling and administrative headcount 
as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the severance benefits accrual  included in the million and million pre tax restructuring charges taken in and  respectively  related to the elimination of approximately  positions in high cost manufacturing locations and in certain administrative positions 
the corporation estimates that  as a result of increases in manufacturing employee headcount in low cost locations  approximately  replacement positions will be filled  yielding a net total of positions eliminated as a result of the and restructuring actions 
as described above  the overall restructuring plan will be completed during accordingly  the remainder of that overall restructuring plan  as currently envisioned  will be implemented in and restructuring charges of approximately million are expected to be recognized in those years in addition to the million recognized in and given the nature and duration of this restructuring plan  charges to be incurred in future years are subject to varying degrees of estimation associated with key assumptions  such as actual timing of execution  currency impacts  general economic conditions  and other variables 
in addition to the recognition of restructuring and exit costs  the corporation also recognizes related expenses  incremental to the cost of the underlying restructuring actions  that do not qualify as restructuring or exit costs under generally accepted accounting principles restructuring related expenses 
those restructuring related expenses include items directly related to the underlying restructuring actions that benefit ongoing operations  such as costs associated with the transfer of equipment 
operating results for the year ended december   included million of restructuring related expenses 
the corporation realized benefits of approximately million in  net of restructuring related expenses 
the corporation expects that incremental pre tax savings associated with the restructuring plan will benefit and results  by million and million  respectively  net of restructuring related expenses 
ultimate savings realized from restructuring actions may be mitigated by such factors as continued economic weakness and competitive pressures  as well as decisions to increase costs in areas such as promotion or research and development above levels that were otherwise assumed 
during  the corporation recognized pre tax restructuring and exit costs of million 
that restructuring charge provided for the transfer of certain power tool production in england to low cost manufacturing facilities in china  including the facility of the corporation s owned joint venture  and for manufacturing rationalization in the hardware and home improvement segment 
in addition  the restructuring charge provided for reductions in administrative functions  principally in the power tools and accessories segment in europe  and for the integration of the accessories business in north america  which previously operated on a stand alone basis  into the professional and consumer power tools business in north america 
as previously indicated  the pre tax restructuring charges recognized in and of million and million  respectively  were net of reversals in and of previously provided restructuring reserves that were no longer required of million and million  respectively 
adjustments to the severance component of restructuring reserves previously established related to i actual attrition factors that differed from those initially estimated  ii more cost effective methods of severing employment that became probable  typically based on negotiations with trade unions or local government institutions  and iii amendments to the initial plan that were approved by the appropriate level of management  based primarily on changes in market conditions that dictated a modification to the intended course of action 
during and  none of the adjustments to the severance obligations recorded in connection with restructuring actions was individually significant 
adjustments to the asset write down component of restructuring reserves previously established related to the receipt of proceeds in excess of carrying values of fixed assets that were disposed of in connection with the restructuring actions 
adjustments to the other charge component of restructuring reserves previously established principally related to settlement of operating lease commitments at amounts less than initially estimated or the corporation s ability to sublease certain facilities exited as part of the restructuring actions 
asset write downs taken as part of the restructuring charge included land  buildings  and manufacturing equipment 
asset write downs taken as part of the and restructuring charges principally related to manufacturing equipment 
the carrying values of land and buildings to be sold were written down to their estimated fair values  generally based upon third party offers  less disposal costs 
the carrying values of manufacturing equipment and furniture and fixtures were written down to their fair value based upon estimated salvage values  which generally were negligible  less disposal cost 
hedging activities the corporation has a number of manufacturing sites throughout the world and sells its products in more than countries 
as a result  it is exposed to movements in the exchange rates of various currencies against the united states dollar and against the currencies of countries in which it manufactures 
the major foreign currencies in which foreign currency risks exist are the euro  pound sterling  canadian dollar  swedish krona  japanese yen  chinese renminbi  australian dollar  mexican peso  czech koruna  and brazilian real 
through its foreign currency activities  the corporation seeks to reduce the risk that cash flows resulting from the sales of products manufactured in a currency different from that of the selling subsidiary will be affected by changes in exchange rates 
on january   the twelve participating member countries of the european monetary union canceled their respective legacy currencies which were replaced by the euro as legal tender 
the corporation believes that the introduction of the euro has resulted in increased competitive pressures in continental europe due to the heightened transparency of intra european pricing structures 
from time to time  currency devaluations may occur in countries in which the corporation sells or manufactures its product 
while the corporation will take actions to mitigate the impacts of any future currency devaluations  there is no assurance that such devaluations will not adversely affect the corporation 
assets and liabilities of subsidiaries located outside of the united states are translated at rates of exchange at the balance sheet date as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
the resulting translation adjustments are included in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity 
during  translation adjustments  recorded in the accumulated other comprehensive income loss component of stockholders equity  increased stockholders equity by million compared to a decrease of million in as more fully explained in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation seeks to issue debt opportunistically  whether at fixed or variable rates  at the lowest possible costs 
based upon its assessment of the future interest rate environment and its desired variable rate debt to total debt ratio  the corporation may elect to manage its interest rate risk associated with changes in the fair value of its indebtedness  or the cash flows of its indebtedness  through the use of interest rate swap agreements 
in order to meet its goal of fixing or limiting interest costs  the corporation maintains a portfolio of interest rate hedge instruments 
the variable rate debt to total debt ratio  after taking interest rate hedges into account  was at december   compared to at december   and at december  at december   average debt maturity was years compared to years at december   and years at december  interest rate sensitivity the following table provides information as of december   about the corporation s derivative financial instruments and other financial instruments that are sensitive to changes in interest rates  including interest rate swaps and debt obligations 
for debt obligations  the table presents principal cash flows and related average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
for interest rate swaps  the table presents notional principal amounts and weighted average interest rates by contractual maturity dates 
notional amounts are used to calculate the contractual payments to be exchanged under the interest rate swaps 
weighted average variable rates are generally based on the london interbank offered rate libor as of the reset dates 
the cash flows of these instruments are denominated in a variety of currencies 
unless otherwise indicated  the information is presented in us dollar equivalents  which is the corporation s reporting currency  as of december  principal payments and interest rate detail by contractual maturity dates fair value assets us dollars in millions thereafter total liabilities liabilities short term borrowings variable rate other currencies average interest rate long term debt fixed rate us dollars

foreign currency exchange rate sensitivity as discussed above  the corporation is exposed to market risks arising from changes in foreign exchange rates 
as of december   the corporation has hedged a portion of its estimated foreign currency transactions using forward exchange contracts 
the corporation estimated the effect on gross profits  based upon a recent estimate of foreign exchange exposures  of a uniform strengthening in the value of the united states dollar and a uniform weakening in the value of the united states dollar 
the larger loss computed was that under an assumed uniform strengthening of the united states dollar  which the corporation estimated would have the effect of reducing gross profits for by approximately million 
as previously indicated  the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates on the corporation s gross profits for were estimated based upon the larger loss computed in the event of an assumed uniform strengthening or weakening in the value of the united states dollar 
that analysis assumes that certain currencies  particularly the chinese renminbi  that have been pegged in relation to the united states dollar in recent years  move against the united states dollar in the case of an assumed strengthening or weakening 
were those currencies to continue to be pegged against the value of the united states dollar  the estimated reduction of gross profits for of million  described in the preceding paragraph  would increase 
in addition to their direct effects  changes in exchange rates also affect sales volumes and foreign currency sales prices as competitors products become more or less attractive 
the sensitivity analysis of the effects of changes in foreign currency exchange rates previously described does not reflect a potential change in sales levels or local currency prices nor does it reflect the changes in exchange rates  compared to those experienced during  inherent in the foreign exchange hedging portfolio at december  critical accounting policies the corporation s accounting policies are more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
as disclosed in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
the corporation believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment  estimation  or complexity than other accounting policies 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation performs goodwill impairment tests on at least an annual basis and more frequently in certain circumstances 
the corporation cannot predict the occurrence of certain events that might adversely affect the reported value of goodwill that totaled million at december  such events may include  but are not limited to  strategic decisions made in response to economic and competitive conditions  the impact of the economic environment on the corporation s customer base  or a material negative change in its relationships with significant customers 
pension and other postretirement benefits costs and obligations are dependent on assumptions used in calculating such amounts 
these assumptions include discount rates  expected return on plan assets  rate of salary increases  health care cost trend rates  mortality rates  and other factors 
in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  actual results that differ from the actuarial assumptions are accumulated and  if in excess of a specified corridor  amortized over future periods and  therefore  generally affect recognized expense and the recorded obligation in future periods 
while the corporation believes that the assumptions used are appropriate  differences in actual experience or changes in the assumptions may materially affect the corporation s financial position or results of operations 
for  the corporation will lower the expected long term rate of return assumption from to and from to for united states and non united states defined benefit pension plans  respectively 
the corporation expects that its pension and other postretirement benefits costs in will exceed the costs recognized in by approximately million 
this increase is principally attributable to the change in various assumptions including the expected long term rate of return  discount rate  and health care cost trend rate  and the effect of the amortization of certain actuarial losses 
as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  the corporation recognized pre tax restructuring charges of million and million during and  respectively 
those pre tax restructuring charges in and were net of reversals of previously established pre tax restructuring reserves of million and million  respectively 
the related restructuring reserves reflect estimates  including those pertaining to separation costs  settlements of contractual obligations  and asset valuations 
the corporation reassesses the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan within the restructuring program at the end of each reporting period 
actual experience has been and may continue to be different from the estimates used to establish the restructuring reserves 
at december   the corporation had liabilities established in conjunction with its restructuring activities that totaled million 
as more fully described in item of this report  the corporation is subject to various legal proceedings and claims  including those with respect to environmental matters  the outcomes of which are subject to significant uncertainty 
the corporation evaluates  among other factors  the degree of probability of an unfavorable outcome  the ability to make a reasonable estimate of the amount of loss  and in certain instances  the ability of other parties to share costs 
also  in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states when a range of probable loss exists  the corporation accrues at the low end of the range when no other more likely amount exists 
unanticipated events or changes in these factors may require the corporation to increase the amount it has accrued for any matter or accrue for a matter that has not been previously accrued because it was not considered probable 
selling  general  and administrative expenses in increased by approximately million over the level due to increased environmental and legal expenses associated with changes in various factors related to matters for which reserves had previously been established as well as to matters which arose during further  as indicated in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  insurance recoveries for environmental and certain general liability claims have not been recognized until realized 
any insurance recoveries  if realized in future periods  could have a favorable impact on the corporation s financial condition or results of operations in the periods realized 
the corporation is also subject to income tax laws in many countries 
judgment is required in assessing the future tax consequences of events that have been recognized in the corporation s financial statements or tax returns 
during  the corporation expects that taxing authorities may complete tax audits currently underway in three significant countries 
the final outcome of these future tax consequences  tax audits  and changes in regulatory tax laws and rates could materially impact the corporation s financial statements 
impact of new accounting standards as more fully described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  on january   the corporation is required to adopt two new accounting standards 
for a discussion of the impact of those new accounting standards upon the corporation  see note financial condition operating activities generated cash of million for the year ended december   compared to million of cash generated for the year ended december  the increase in cash provided by operating activities in over the levels was primarily the result of higher net earnings and lower cash taxes and interest 
this increase was partially offset by higher cash spending on restructuring actions  including restructuring related expenses
