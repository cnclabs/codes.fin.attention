item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview we were founded as a solutions oriented company  designing and manufacturing products to suppress or eliminate electromagnetic interference emi 
in recent years  we broadened our focus and product lines to become a control products and systems company  providing a wide range of components and systems used to condition  regulate  transmit  receive  or govern electronic performance 
although our components and systems are used in many industries worldwide  our largest markets are telecommunications equipment and military aerospace which represented and  respectively  of our fiscal sales 
in telecommunications  our products are used in numerous systems including wireless base stations  optical networks  broadband switching equipment  internet servers  and global positioning systems 
military aerospace applications for our products include missile defense systems  smart weapons and munitions  simulation equipment  and avionic upgrades 
other markets for our products include medical instrumentation  industrial equipment  computer  and automotive 
our operations are primarily conducted in two reportable business segments signal products and power products 
our signal products group manufactures a broad line of discrete emi filters  filtered arrays  filtered connectors  specialty ceramic capacitors single layer  temperature compensating  high voltage  and switch mode  ceramic based wireless products coaxial ceramic resonators  patch antennas  bandpass filters  and duplexers  rf and microwave filters  and related products and systems 
our power technologies group currently manufactures various power management and conditioning products including power distribution units  power line filters  and power entry devices 
in addition  we have developed and introduced an advanced systems product offering to become a provider of more complex power management systems  including a line of digital radio frequency control equipment for remote and automatic electronic systems management 
for operating segment reporting purposes  these advanced systems are included in our power technologies group 
adoption of new accounting pronouncement in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 

under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are no longer amortized  but are instead subject to a periodic impairment test at least annually 
other intangible assets continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
effective december   we adopted sfas no 
accordingly  no amortization of goodwill was recognized in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations for the year ended november   compared to  and  for the years ended november  and  respectively 
as required by sfas no 
 prior year results have not been restated 
if we had discontinued amortization of goodwill at the beginning of fiscal year  net loss for the year ended november  would have decreased  or four cents per share  and net income for the year ended november  would have increased  or four cents per share 
in accordance with the provisions of sfas no 
 we performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and determined that no impairment loss need be recognized in the year ended november  acquisition on july   we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of fsy microwave  inc fsy 
fsy  based in columbia maryland  designs and manufactures rf and microwave filters  combiners  amplifiers  multiplexers  duplexers  and related products and systems 
these products and systems are used in numerous industries including military  aerospace  medical  and telecommunications 
fsy s products are a natural complement and extension to our ceramic based wireless product offerings 
in addition  we believe our low cost manufacturing capability and established sales channels will provide additional revenue opportunities for fsy products 
the aggregate cash purchase price for fsy was approximately million  including legal fees and other costs directly related to the acquisition 
the purchase price was entirely funded through our available cash reserves 
the results of operations of the acquired business have been included in the accompanying consolidated financial statements since the date of acquisition 
accordingly  fsy net sales of million have been included in our consolidated net sales for the year ended november  and are reported within the signal products group for operating segment purposes

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued compared to net sales consolidated net sales decreased by million or from this decrease  which was reflected throughout all of our major product lines  was primarily driven by an unprecedented slowdown in the telecommunications equipment industry and sluggish overall economic conditions in the united states and europe 
sales of signal products amounted to million in  including fsy product shipments of million 
in  sales of signal products were million 
sales of power products decreased by million in  from million in fiscal to million in fiscal power product sales included shipments of million in and million in of our recently introduced advanced systems product offering 
although we believe the long term market potential for these advanced systems remains strong  their initial market introduction and penetration has been severely hampered by the current telecom market conditions 
as a result of competitive pressures  average selling prices declined slightly in throughout most of our product lines 
overall demand for our products was very soft in with total customer orders of million  a decrease of million or from in addition to these customer orders  we assumed approximately million of customer order backlog in connection with the acquisition of fsy 
at november   our consolidated sales order backlog was million  up million from the end of fiscal early in  the telecommunications equipment market began to experience a severe industry wide downturn 
this downturn was driven by several factors  including the collapse of numerous start up  competitive service providers and dot coms resulting in excess component inventories  unsold telecom systems  and a secondary market of used equipment throughout the telecommunications industry and reduced spending for infrastructure and network equipment by incumbent telephone service providers as competitive pressures from start up providers eased  certain technological advances stalled  and economic recessionary pressures grew 
in fiscal  we believe this severe downturn demonstrated some signs of moderating 
customer order cancellations and delivery date pushouts  which were prevalent throughout  significantly diminished in fiscal although we believe the prolonged market downturn may have bottomed out in fiscal  overall market demand continues to be volatile with the timing and extent of the market s recovery remaining uncertain 
we cannot forecast with any degree of certainty when a full recovery in capital spending may be expected  nor can we forecast what normal customer spending levels may be once this structural market correction is completed 
restructuring charges in fiscal  we adopted and implemented a plan to restructure our operations and reduce operating expenses in response to the severe slowdown in the global telecommunications equipment market 
the restructuring plan was intended to reduce excess manufacturing capacity  improve efficiencies  and align our operations with current business expectations 
the plan included consolidating manufacturing facilities  writing off slow moving inventories  and disposing of excess property and equipment 
in connection with this plan  we recorded restructuring charges of  in these restructuring charges consisted of employee severance costs and losses on the disposal of excess fixed assets 
in addition  we increased our inventory reserves for excess and slow moving items by million 
these additional inventory reserves were included in cost of products sold for the fiscal year ended november  gross margin gross margin was million or of sales in fiscal in fiscal  gross margin was million or of sales  excluding the additional inventory reserves of million previously discussed 
the decline in gross margin primarily reflects lower sales volume and manufacturing inefficiencies caused by the abrupt downturn in product demand by our telecommunications customers 
in addition to our formal restructuring plan  we identified and implemented numerous cost reduction programs throughout fiscal year as a result of these efforts  gross margin in fiscal is expected to approximate to of net sales 
at november   we had a total workforce of employees  including fsy personnel of in light of current business conditions  we will continue to review our organization and cost structure to further reduce operating expenses and improve efficiencies

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued selling  general and administrative expense selling expense was million or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in the increase in selling expense  as a percentage of sales  reflects the impact of lower sales volume and certain fixed selling expenses 
this impact was partially offset by lower effective sales commission rates  reduced advertising expenses  and decreased personnel costs 
general and administrative expense was million in  compared to million in the decrease in general and administrative expense primarily reflects lower personnel costs and the reduction of certain variable expenditures for professional services 
in addition   of goodwill amortization was recorded and included in general and administrative expense in fiscal with the adoption of sfas no 
 no goodwill amortization was recorded in fiscal year other income and expense interest expense decreased by  during the period  from  in to  in the decrease in interest expense primarily reflects reduced bank indebtedness 
we hold numerous united states and foreign patents relating to polymer multilayer pml technology 
we realized license fee income of  in and  in upon the granting of pml technology licenses 
although these licenses  as well as other pml licenses that we have previously granted  require certain royalties to be paid to us upon the sale of products utilizing pml technology  it is not known what future commercial value  if any  these patents and related licenses may have 
in fiscal  as part of our formal plan to consolidate manufacturing facilities and dispose of excess property and equipment  we closed two operating facilities in elizabethtown  pennsylvania 
manufacturing in these facilities had consisted of certain wireless products  specialty ceramic capacitors  and other signal products 
these operations were consolidated into our manufacturing facilities in juarez  mexico and new orleans  louisiana 
in march  the two elizabethtown facilities and related excess equipment were sold 
net proceeds realized from the sale amounted to approximately million  and a gain of  was recorded and included in other nonoperating income in fiscal in november  we sold certain land and building in erie  pennsylvania 
manufacturing at this site had consisted of various power and advanced systems products 
these product lines and operations have been successfully integrated into our fairview  pennsylvania manufacturing facility 
net proceeds realized from the sale amounted to  with a loss of  recognized on the sale and included in nonoperating expense in fiscal our wholly owned foreign subsidiaries transact business with certain customers and vendors in currencies other than their local currency 
as a result  we recognize gains and losses on foreign currency transactions 
foreign currency transaction gains and losses  however  were not material in any of the periods presented herein 
we realized interest income of  in and  in from temporary cash investments 
income taxes our effective income tax rate was in and in  compared to an applicable federal and state statutory income tax rate of approximately 
differences between the effective tax rate and statutory tax rate primarily arise from state tax provisions and foreign income tax rates 
at november   we had recorded certain deferred tax assets 
we have assessed our past earnings history and trends  and expiration dates of tax attribute carryforwards  and have determined that it is more likely than not that these deferred tax assets will be realized to offset future taxable income from ordinary and recurring operations

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued compared to net sales throughout  our sales and customer order rates were negatively impacted by the severe downturn in the telecommunications equipment industry 
consolidated net sales decreased by million or from sales of signal products decreased by million during the period  amounting to million in and million in sales of power products amounted to million in  a decrease of million from the preceding year 
in  power product sales included shipments of million of our advanced systems product offering 
average selling prices declined slightly in throughout most of our product offerings 
overall demand for our products was very soft in with total customer orders of million  a decrease of million or from in addition  we reduced our sales order backlog by million in to reflect previously recorded orders that our customers requested to be postponed or canceled 
as a result  our backlog at november   was approximately million  compared to million at november  restructuring charges during fiscal  in response to the poor overall business climate  we adopted and implemented a plan to consolidate certain manufacturing facilities and dispose of excess property and equipment 
in connection with this plan  we recorded restructuring charges of  in in addition  because of the abrupt decline in customer orders  we increased our inventory reserves for excess and slow moving items by million 
these additional inventory reserves were included in cost of products sold for the fiscal year ended november  gross margin excluding the additional inventory reserves of million discussed above  gross margin was million  or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in with the severe slowdown in the telecommunications industry  our sales in were significantly below previously planned levels 
as a result  gross margin in was negatively impacted by labor inefficiencies and lower absorption of fixed manufacturing overhead 
at november   we had a total workforce of employees  a reduction of or from november  selling  general and administrative expense selling expense was million or of sales in  compared to million or of sales in the increase in selling expense  as a percentage of sales  principally reflects fixed selling expenses being absorbed over lower sales volume and higher effective commission rates on sales of product through distributors 
general and administrative expense was million in  compared to million in the decrease in general and administrative expense primarily reflects lower personnel costs and the elimination of certain discretionary charges and expenditures 
other income and expense interest expense decreased by approximately million during the period  from million in to  in the decrease in interest expense principally reflects reduced bank indebtedness 
as more fully discussed below  all borrowings under our domestic line of credit and a million term loan were repaid in august weighted average short term borrowings under our domestic line of credit were million in  with an average interest rate of approximately

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued risk factors that may affect future results in fiscal year  approximately of our sales were to customers in the telecommunications industry 
our four largest customers  original equipment manufacturers of telecommunications equipment  represented an aggregate of our total consolidated net sales in throughout and  the telecommunications equipment industry has experienced a severe slowdown 
if this slowdown continues or intensifies  it will have a material negative impact on our future operating performance 
in addition  our results of operations may be negatively affected in the future by a variety of other factors including competitive pricing pressures  new technologies which decrease the demand for our products  new product offerings by our competitors  product cost changes  changes in the overall economic climate  cancellation of existing customer order backlog  difficulties in successfully integrating our acquisition of fsy  unanticipated impairment of assets  changes in the availability of raw materials  and changes in product mix 
liquidity  capital resources and financial condition we maintain a line of credit with our principal lending institution  pnc bank  na of erie  pennsylvania the bank 
this revolving credit line is unsecured  with interest rates on borrowings at or below the prevailing prime rate 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under the line of credit 
the line of credit agreement contains certain covenants  the most restrictive of which require us to maintain designated minimum levels of net worth and profitability and impose certain restrictions on us regarding additional indebtedness 
in february  certain of these covenants were amended or waived by the bank 
at november   we were in compliance with all debt covenants  as amended 
maximum borrowings under the amended agreement may not exceed million 
our ability to borrow in the future under this credit facility is dependent on our ongoing compliance with the restrictive covenants 
whether we continue to comply with these covenants is largely dependent on our ability to attain certain levels of operating performance and profitability in the future  for which there can be no assurance 
the amended line of credit agreement expires april  our wholly owned german subsidiary maintains an unsecured euro line of credit with a german financial institution aggregating  euro million 
at november   no borrowings were outstanding under this line of credit 
future borrowings  if any  will bear interest at rates below the prevailing prime rate and will be payable upon demand 
overall  our net working capital remains stable 
at november   we had net working capital of million  compared to million at november  and million at november  our current ratio is very strong with current assets times current liabilities at november   compared to at november  in fiscal  in response to the poor overall market conditions and as part of our related cost containment programs  our capital expenditures were controlled to minimum required amounts 
in  our capital expenditures for property  plant and equipment amounted to  these capital expenditures were primarily for manufacturing equipment and tooling to enhance efficiencies in our ceramic capacitor operations and our advanced systems product offerings 
our cash expenditures for property  plant and equipment were million in and million in in  capital expenditures were primarily incurred during the first half of the year for manufacturing equipment and tooling to enhance operating efficiencies and increase capacity for certain signal and power product lines 
capital expenditures in fiscal year primarily related to manufacturing equipment for our new mexican facility and other production capacity expansion 
at november   we had not entered into any material commitments for capital expenditures 
in  as part of our efforts to consolidate manufacturing facilities and dispose of excess property and equipment  we sold certain land  building and equipment located in elizabethtown and erie  pennsylvania 
manufacturing previously conducted at these sites has been transferred and successfully integrated into our other production facilities 
net proceeds realized from the sale of these assets was approximately million 
in fiscal year  we completed a  square foot expansion to our manufacturing facility in wesson  mississippi 
financing for this project was substantially provided by the state of mississippi through general obligation bonds issued in december accordingly  we received  of bond proceeds in fiscal the bonds have a term of years and bear interest at an average rate of 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued as previously indicated  we acquired all of the outstanding common stock of fsy in july  the aggregate cash purchase price for fsy was approximately million  excluding possible future contingent payments 
the amount of contingent payments will be determined based upon the increase in sales of the acquired product lines during the three years subsequent to the acquisition date 
the purchase price  net of cash acquired  was approximately million 
this net purchase price was entirely funded through available cash reserves 
we have adopted a stock repurchase program 
under this program  we may repurchase up to million of the company s outstanding common stock 
acquired shares are to be purchased in the open market or through privately negotiated transactions at prevailing market prices 
funding for these repurchases is expected to come from available cash reserves and borrowings under our revolving line of credit facility 
the amount and timing of the shares repurchased are based on our ongoing assessment of the company s capital structure  liquidity  and the market price of the company s common stock 
the repurchased shares are held as treasury stock 
in fiscal   shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of million 
in fiscal   shares were repurchased at an aggregate cost of million 
since the inception of the stock repurchase program   shares have been repurchased at a total cost of million 
research and development expenditures  which encompass the personnel and related expenses devoted to developing new products and processes  amounted to million in  million in  and million in we expect to continue our investment in research and development in  as we continuously enhance existing product lines  design new signal and power products  and further develop our fsy and advanced systems product offerings 
income taxes paid during the fiscal years ended november   and amounted to  million  and million  respectively 
as a result of and operating losses  we had prepaid income taxes and income tax refund receivables aggregating million at november  accordingly  we expect cash outlays for income taxes to be significantly less than income tax expense for fiscal year as of november   our obligations and firm commitments are as follows in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt operating leases current financial resources  including working capital and existing lines of credit  and anticipated funds from operations are expected to be sufficient to meet operating cash requirements throughout fiscal year  including scheduled long term debt repayment  lease commitments  planned capital equipment expenditures  research and development expenses  and possible stock repurchases 
there can be no assurance  however  that unplanned capital replacement or other future events will not require us to seek additional debt or equity financing and  if so required  that it will be available on terms acceptable to us 
despite operating losses in and  our overall cash flow remained strong 
net cash generated by operating activities amounted to million in and million in operating cash flow in fiscal reflects the refund of million of federal income taxes from prior year net operating loss carrybacks and overpayments 
in addition  as a result of improved turnover rates  accounts receivable and inventories decreased by million and million  respectively 
in fiscal  operating cash flow was positively impacted by reductions in certain working capital requirements 
in particular  as a result of lower sales volume in  accounts receivable decreased by million 
net cash generated by operations was million in fiscal  reflecting strong profitability and limited working capital increases 
in august  we sold million shares of our common stock in a public offering which resulted in net proceeds of million  after deducting issuance costs 
the net proceeds of the offering were used to repay million of revolving line of credit indebtedness and million of term loan debt  with the remaining proceeds added to cash and cash equivalents available for general corporate purposes

table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued at november   goodwill represented of total assets and of stockholders equity 
in addition to million of goodwill recognized in connection with the acquisition of fsy  a majority of our recorded goodwill was recognized in in connection with our acquisition of substantially all of the assets of the signal conditioning products division of amp incorporated 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 effective december   we have performed the required impairment tests of goodwill and determined that no impairment loss need be recognized in the year ended november  quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency certain of our european sales and related selling expenses are denominated in euros  british pounds sterling  and other local currencies 
in addition  certain of our operating expenses are denominated in mexican pesos 
as a result  fluctuations in currency exchange rates may affect our operating results and cash flows 
to manage our exposure to the euro and british pound sterling  we occasionally enter into forward currency exchange contracts 
at november   we had forward currency exchange contracts with aggregate notional amounts of million expiring at various dates over a nine month period 
the fair value of these contracts at november   was a net receivable of  for each of the three years ended november   currency exchange rate gains and losses were not material 
interest rate exposure we have market risk exposure relating to possible fluctuations in interest rates 
from time to time  we utilize interest rate swap agreements to minimize the risks and costs associated with variable rate debt 
we do not enter into derivative financial instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the interest rate swap agreements are entered into with major financial institutions thereby minimizing the risk of credit loss 
at november   no interest rate swap agreements were outstanding 
environmental matters we are subject to various laws and governmental regulations concerning environmental matters and employee safety and health in the united states and other countries 
us federal environmental legislation having particular impact on us includes the toxic substances control act  the resource conservation and recovery act  the clean air act  the clean water act  and the safe drinking water act 
we also are subject to regulation by the occupational safety and health administration osha concerning employee safety and health matters 
the united states environmental protection agency epa  osha  and other federal agencies have the authority to promulgate regulations that have an impact on our operations 
in addition to these federal agencies  various states have been delegated certain authority under the aforementioned federal statutes 
many state and local governments have adopted environmental and employee safety and health laws and regulations  some of which are similar to federal requirements 
state and federal authorities may seek fines and penalties for violation of these laws and regulations 
as part of our continuing environmental program  we have been able to comply with such proceedings and orders without any materially adverse effect on our business 
we are not currently involved in any legal proceedings involving environmental matters 
impact of inflation in recent years  inflation has not had a significant impact on our operations 
however  we continuously monitor operating price increases  particularly in connection with the supply of precious metals used in our manufacturing of certain ceramic capacitors 
to the extent permitted by competition  we pass increased costs on to our customers by increasing sales price over time 
sales price increases  however  were not significant in any of the years presented herein

establishes one accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  requiring those assets be measured at the lower of carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell 
this accounting model applies to all long lived assets  including those associated with discontinued operations  and replaces certain prior pronouncements and guidance

 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure sfas no 

sfas no 
amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas no 
amends the prior disclosure guidance and requires prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
the provisions of sfas no 
are generally effective for fiscal years ending after december  we are currently evaluating the new pronouncement and have not yet determined what effect  if any  the adoption of sfas no 
will have on our financial position and results of operations 
critical accounting policies the methods  estimates and judgments we use in applying our most critical accounting policies have a significant impact on the results we report in our financial statements 
the us securities and exchange commission has defined the most critical accounting policies as the ones that are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and require us to make our most difficult and subjective judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates of matters that are inherently uncertain 
based on this definition  we believe our most critical accounting policies relate to the valuation and carrying amounts of accounts receivable  inventories  long lived assets  and deferred tax assets 
of 
table of contents management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors including an assessment of the customer s financial condition and the length of time a receivable is past due 
at november   our allowance for doubtful accounts was  or approximately of our aggregate accounts receivable 
in determining the adequacy of this allowance  we have assumed that the current severe downturn in the telecommunications industry will stabilize sometime in fiscal if this stabilization does not occur  or if market conditions deteriorate further  our customers may not be able to meet their financial obligations to us 
accordingly  our estimate of the recoverability of amounts due us could be reduced by a material amount 
at november   we had recorded inventory reserves in the aggregate amount of million for excess and slow moving items 
in determining the adequacy of these reserves  we considered numerous factors including current customer forecasts and estimated usage 
should these forecasts and estimates change due to market  technological or other factors  the net realizable value of our inventories may be materially less than our current carrying values 
with the adoption of sfas no 
 we review goodwill for possible impairment at least annually 
impairment losses are recognized when the implied fair value of goodwill is less than its carrying value 
the implied fair value of goodwill is contingent upon many factors  including estimates of future discounted operating cash flows 
long lived assets other than goodwill are reviewed for impairment whenever indicators of possible impairment exist 
impairments are recognized when the expected future operating cash flows derived from such assets are less than their carrying values 
no impairment losses have been recognized in any of the periods presented herein 
however  our future cash flow expectations assume that the current poor market conditions throughout the telecommunications industry will begin to improve significantly in if long term market conditions do not improve significantly  our long lived assets may become materially impaired 
we record valuation allowances to reduce deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not that some portion of the asset may not be realized 
presently  we believe that all deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized and a valuation allowance is not required 
we evaluate the need for valuation allowances on a regular basis and make adjustments as needed 
these adjustments  when made  may have a materially negative impact on our financial statements
