item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview in november  vaxgen was formed to continue development of aidsvax  a preventative vaccine against hiv aids 
at that time  genentech licensed to us the technology necessary for completing development and commercialization of aidsvax under a license agreement 
currently  genentech owns approximately of our outstanding common stock 
since our formation  we have focused on developing and testing aidsvax 
we have developed two formulations of aidsvax  which focus on the predominant hiv subtype in north america  europe  the caribbean  and australia subtype b and the predominant hiv subtype in southeast asia and east asia subtype e 
we have commenced two phase iii clinical trials  one in north america and europe to determine the efficacy aidsvax b b and one in thailand  to determine the efficacy of aidsvax b e 
in october  we completed the initial inoculation and enrollment of over  trial volunteers for the north american european phase iii clinical trial  which was conducted in clinical centers and completed the clinical trial as planned in december on february   we announced that the study did not show a statistically significant reduction of hiv within the study population as a whole  which was the primary endpoint of the trial 
however  the study did show a statistically significant reduction of hiv infection in certain vaccinated groups 
initial trial data indicated that black and asian volunteers appeared to produce higher levels of antibodies against hiv 
white and hispanic volunteers appeared to develop consistently lower levels of protective antibodies after vaccination 
we intend to conduct additional analyses of the data to confirm if there was a direct correlation between the level of antibodies and the prevention of infection 
we are not sure yet why certain groups have a better immune response  but these preliminary results may indicate that a surface protein gp vaccine stimulates neutralizing antibodies correlates with prevention of hiv infection 
the results of the clinical trial also initially indicated that the vaccine is well tolerated and has a high safety profile 
based on the preliminary results  we intend to continue development of aidsvax through licensure  including additional studies as needed in the subgroups in which the vaccine demonstrated significant reduction in infection and in parallel continue to work on the vaccine to make it more broadly effective 
however  our continued development of aidsvax will depend on whether we obtain funding from sources including governmental agencies and philanthropic organizations  rather than from the equity markets 
in august  we completed the initial inoculation and enrollment of over  volunteers for the thai phase iii clinical trial  which is being conducted in clinical centers in bangkok 
we are scheduled to complete this trial during the second quarter of and expect to announce clinical results during the last quarter of the fda has designated our hiv aids vaccine candidates fast track products for the prevention of hiv infection 
the fast track designation could enable more rapid regulatory review of aidsvax if and when we submit a bla 
in february  we and a group of south korean investors announced the formation of a joint venture  called celltrion  to build and operate a manufacturing facility in incheon  south korea 
as our part of the investment in the joint venture  we are providing mammalian cell culture technology and biologics production expertise 
celltrion contributed funds to a subsidiary for the purpose of funding the first million of construction cost for a smaller manufacturing facility in south san francisco  california 
this smaller facility is intended to support the licensure and commercial launch of aidsvax  but is also designed to support the manufacture of other biopharmaceutical products 
in the event that aidsvax is proven successful and the incheon facility is validated and licensed to produce aidsvax  celltrion would produce bulk material that will be sold to us 
however  in the event that aidsvax is proven to be unsuccessful  we believe the incheon facility would be used to manufacture other biopharmaceutical products  in which we would share in the profits based on our percentage ownership 
after all rounds of financing are complete  our fully diluted ownership of the joint venture will be approximately 
although we have no further funding obligation to celltrion  we are responsible for any additional capital equipment costs in excess of million for which we receive equivalent value in common stock and certain future costs related to the validation  operation and licensure of the manufacturing facility in south san francisco  california 
to date  we have generated  in revenue from grants from the nih for research and development of hiv vaccines along with funds received through a collaborative agreement with bbi biotech  which is funded by the niaid  to obtain and store clinical specimens from our north american european phase iii clinical trial  and from service agreement fees from our manufacturing joint venture 
in september  we were awarded a contract from niaid to develop a new anthrax vaccine and to create a feasibility plan to manufacture an emergency stockpile of million doses of an anthrax vaccine 
the period of performance of the contract is from september  through december  the goal of the government contract is to develop a modern vaccine that proves to be safe in humans  efficacious in animal challenge studies and requires no more than three injections 
under the initial phase of the niaid contract  we will be awarded  upon satisfaction of certain milestones  to advance the development of a vaccine candidate initially developed by the usamriid 
if results from the phase i clinical trial are positive  niaid may elect  at least days prior to december   to extend the contract 
if the contract were to be extended  we would be eligible for an additional contract award of  beginning in late and running through as a continuation of the current contract to support a phase ii clinical trial 
a second  much larger contract to manufacture a million dose stockpile under an ind will be awarded by niaid through a competitive bid process by the end of the third quarter of also in september  we were awarded a  task order to provide aidsvax under a supply contract to develop hiv vaccines for a forthcoming phase iii trial in thailand funded by the nih and conducted by the wrair 
the majority of the contract award will be earned in there are two government options  if exercised  which would increase the contract award to a total of  in february  the nih exercised the first option to take delivery of the first two thirds of the vaccine supply 
we expect that the nih will exercise their second option for the remaining balance of the vaccine supply in september the start date of the clinical trial has been delayed due to matters outside of our control  but is now currently scheduled to begin enrolling volunteers during the fourth quarter of and will combine our aidsvax b e vaccine with alvac  an aids vaccine candidate being developed by aventis pasteur 
in december  we announced that we and kaketsuken entered into initial agreements that will allow us to begin development of kaketsuken s attenuated small pox vaccine  lc kaketsuken  for use in the us  subject to approval by the fda 
we believe  that the vaccine  which was licensed in japan in  will have a better safety profile  yet be equally effective  compared to small pox vaccines currently available in the us we are currently in negotiations with kaketsuken to define the specific commercial terms of our relationship 
we have incurred losses since inception as a result of research and development and general and administrative expenses in support of our operations 
as of december   we had a deficit accumulated during the development stage of  we anticipate incurring substantial losses over at least the next two to three years as we complete our clinical trials  apply for regulatory approvals continue development of our vaccines and expand our operations 
since inception  our research and development expenses have been applied to two product development projects aidsvax  our hiv vaccine candidate  and a program to develop a new anthrax vaccine for the us government 
for aidsvax  we have incurred total costs of  in research and development since we began operations in late during the last three years we have incurred costs of   and  during   and  respectively 
the most significant research and development costs incurred for the development of aidsvax include the costs to conduct the phase iii clinical trials  the cost of the clinical materials  the costs associated with the laboratory activities required to support the trials  the establishment of a regulatory and quality systems group to support the possible licensure of the products  and the costs to refine the manufacturing process of the vaccine 
in  we expect the development cost for aidsvax will be approximately  and is primarily associated with the conclusion of the thai phase iii clinical trial the north american european phase iii clinical trial was completed as scheduled in december completion meant that the last volunteer remaining in the trial had completed the study protocol and that all of the data collected during the multiple year study was locked for analysis 
up until mid february  the data continued to be blinded and was not unblinded until when the final analysis began 
on february   we announced that the study did not show a statistically significant reduction in hiv infection within the study group as a whole  which was the primary endpoint of the clinical trial 
however  the study did show a statistically significant reduction of hiv infection in certain subgroup populations 
the results of the clinical trial also initially indicated that the vaccine  aidsvax b b  is well tolerated and has a high safety profile 
we intend to conduct additional analyses to confirm if there was a direct correlation between the level of antibodies and the prevention of infection 
however  if additional clinical trials are needed  we intend only to continue the development of aidsvax b b if we are able to obtain funding from governmental or philanthropic sources 
the thai phase iii clinical trial  which is testing our aidsvax b e formulation in a blood borne transmission study  is scheduled for completion in june and we anticipate announcing the results of this trial sometime during the fourth quarter of in october  the thai trial underwent its final safety and conduct review by the data safety and monitoring board dsmb 
the dsmb concluded that the study was being conducted appropriately and that the vaccine was appearing safe 
besides a good safety profile  the retention of volunteers remaining in the trial continues to remain above expectations 
on an annualized basis the retention rate as of september   of the volunteers in the trial continued to participate 
the dsmb also conducted an interim analysis of efficacy and recommended that the study continue to its planned conclusion in june the anthrax vaccine project began during the fourth quarter of when the nih awarded us a cost reimbursement contract to develop a new vaccine to prevent anthrax infection 
as of december   we have incurred total costs of  towards this project  which has been deferred along with the related revenue until the milestones that are required have been met 
we expect to incur approximately additional costs of  during  of which we expect to receive be reimbursement for all our direct expenses  coverage for a certain part of our overhead and general and administrative expenses and a fixed profit amount 
in february  we received official notification from niaid indicating that we met the program requirements stipulated under milestone of the anthrax vaccine development contract 
milestone required us to produce the pilot lot of the anthrax vaccine clinical material amongst other associated activities 
along with milestone  we continue to perform  in parallel  against the other milestones required under the contract with niaid 
thus far  we are performing within budget and on schedule 
we cannot reasonably estimate the nature  timing and cost of completing these product development projects due to the numerous risks and uncertainties associated with developing vaccines  including o intense and changing governmental regulation  both foreign and domestic  and social and political considerations with respect to drug development  particularly bio terrorism and aids research  o the fact that the anthrax vaccine project is in the very early stages of pre clinical testing and that we have only limited experience in developing vaccines and products other than aidsvax  o the uncertainty of future pre clinical and clinical study results and the uncertainty of the timing of enrolling volunteers in vaccine trials  particularly in large scale clinical vaccine trials enrolling hundreds and thousands of volunteers in multiple cities and in various countries  o the possibility of delays in the completion of clinical trials caused by different interpretations of pre clinical and clinical data  and o the uncertainty related to our manufacturing facilities  which are in an early stage of construction  various risks related to our reliance on third parties  including genentech  celltrion and government entities 
see the section entitled risk factors for a more detailed discussion of these risks and uncertainties 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our operating results and financial condition is based upon our financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of the financial statements requires us to make estimates  judgments  and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses 
while we believe our estimates  judgments  and assumptions are reasonable  the inherent nature of estimates is that actual results will likely be different from the estimates made 
we believe the following critical accounting policy affect the most significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue when all of the following conditions have occurred o persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  o delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  o the price is fixed and determinable  and o collectibility is reasonably assured 
our fees are typically considered to be fixed or determinable at the inception of an arrangement and are negotiated at the outset of an arrangement and are generally based on specific services or products to be delivered 
in the event payment terms are provided that differ significantly from our standard business practices and collectibility is not reasonably assured  the fees are deemed to not be fixed or determinable and revenue is recognized as the fees are paid 
in addition  we adopted the guidance provided by the sec  which addresses the proper recognition of service revenue 
we believe that this is the appropriate treatment of our contract with the nih to develop a new anthrax vaccine 
under this arrangement we deferred revenues and expenses on our balance sheet until we are able to provide objective evidence that we have attained the specified milestones established by the nih 
at december   we had  of deferred costs and  of deferred revenues related to this agreement 
results of operations year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue contract revenue increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the revenue in primarily consisted of funds received as reimbursements under a collaborative agreement with bbi biotech and two small business innovation research sbir grants that are funded by niaid  and service agreement revenue of  earned from the celltrion joint venture and its wholly owned subsidiary  vaxgen celltrion  inc revenue earned in one period is not indicative of revenue to be earned in future periods 
research and development expenses research and development expenses increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the net increase is due primarily to the increase in personnel expenses of  the final closeout expenses payable to our north american and european clinical trial sites and service fees associated with the completion of our two phase iii clinical trials amounting to an increase of  offset by a reduction of  in fees paid to our licensing partner  genentech 
the increase in personnel cost and service fees include salary and benefits expenses and fees for services required to support our regulatory filings  the advanced development of our manufacturing processes and the monitoring and auditing expenses normally incurred at the end of a phase iii clinical trial 
we expect research and development expenses to increase for the foreseeable future if we are able to advance the product candidates we are developing into clinical development and if we are able to raise necessary funds to support such programs 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses increased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to higher spending for occupancy  personnel and insurance costs 
prior to the fourth quarter of  we entered into a sublease agreement to occupy an additional  square feet of space to establish our south san francisco manufacturing facility and the laboratory facilities needed to support a manufacturing operation 
personnel costs increased due to the hiring of additional personnel required to support the expanding infrastructure of our operations 
finally  insurance premium cost  mainly in the product liability and directors and officers liability programs increased due to current market conditions in the insurance industry 
we expect general and administrative expenses will be maintained at similar levels but will be adjusted according to the level of our research and development activity and planned operations 
other income  net other income  net  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this was primarily attributable to lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and investment securities  along with lower interest yields 
year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenue revenue increased to  for the year ended december  from  in december  revenue in primarily consisted of funds received as reimbursements under a collaborative agreement with bbi biotech 
revenue earned in one period is not indicative of research contract revenue to be earned in future periods 
research and development expenses research and development expenses decreased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease is due to a reduction of fees paid to genentech for clinical material as a result of the clinical trials winding down along with lower clinical trial site costs  laboratory supply costs and fees paid to third parties associated with conducting the clinical trials 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a  non cash compensation charge in related to the issuance of common stock to three executives in connection with the achievement of a bonus provision in their employment contracts  offset by higher infrastructure costs along with an increase of approximately  in legal fees related to business development and the resolution of an employee matter 
other income  net other income  net  consisting primarily of interest income  decreased  from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december  this was primarily attributable to lower average balances of cash  cash equivalents and investment securities  along with lower interest yields 
liquidity and capital resources our primary financing requirements are for i capital equipment expenditures related to the manufacturing facility in south san francisco  california  ii funding our day to day working capital requirements  and iii research and development costs 
cash  cash equivalents and investment securities were  and our working capital position was  at december  we have financed our operations since inception primarily through capital provided by genentech  sales of our common stock and through an issuance of convertible preferred stock 
genentech has no obligation to provide us future funding 
we completed our initial public offering in july  in which we sold  shares of common stock resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately  in early  we received net proceeds of  from private placement financing activities  which were completed prior to our initial public offering 
in december  we completed a private placement of common stock with vulcan ventures  inc the funds from the private placement helped support our on going operations along with our current clinical trials 
this private placement has also enabled us to commence development of a formulation of aidsvax  that focuses on the predominant hiv type found in africa  china  india and south america subtype c 
currently  we have developed formulations of aidsvax  that focus on the predominant hiv type in north america  europe  the caribbean and australia subtype b and the predominant hiv subtype in southeast asia and east asia subtype e 
the private placement consisted of approximately  shares of common stock  which resulted in proceeds  net of expenses  to us of approximately  on may  we completed a preferred stock financing through which four investors paid us an aggregate of approximately  in consideration for  shares of our series a preferred stock at a price of  per share  convertible into shares of our common stock  at an initial conversion price of per share 
in the event that there is no earlier conversion  we must redeem the series a preferred stock for cash on may   at a redemption price equal to  per share plus all accrued and unpaid dividends 
expenses relating to the transaction were approximately  resulting in net proceeds to us of approximately  the proceeds from the series a preferred stock financing have been used to develop our commercial scale manufacturing facilities  the potential development of new adjuvants and general corporate purposes 
during the fourth quarter of  two investor s converted  shares in the aggregate of preferred stock in exchange for  shares of common stock  which included shares issued for accrued but unpaid dividends 
as of december    shares of series a preferred stock remained outstanding 
in connection with the preferred stock financing  we issued warrants for the purchase of  shares of our common stock to our preferred stock investors 
the warrants  which expire on may   originally had an initial exercise price of per share  however effective as of may   the exercise price was automatically adjusted to per share and the number of shares issuable on exercise of the warrants increased to  in accordance to the terms of the warrants 
since our inception  investing activities  other than purchases and sales of investment securities  have consisted entirely of equipment acquisitions and leasehold improvements 
from inception through december   our gross investment in equipment and leasehold improvements was  the increase in equipment and leasehold improvements has been primarily due to the development of our research and development laboratories and the establishment of larger office facilities 
net cash used in operating activities for was  representing expenditures for research and development costs and general and administrative expenses 
in october  we entered into collaboration with the cdc to support research at six of the clinics in the united states conducting phase iii clinical trials of our aidsvax vaccine 
the participating sites implemented our phase iii protocol  as well as conducted epidemiological  social and behavioral research  which will be shared by the company and the cdc 
the sites were compensated directly by the cdc for the clinical costs 
the cdc has agreed to contribute approximately  to the participating sites over a four year period 
in  we finalized a collaborative agreement with bbi biotech  which is being funded by the niaid  to obtain and store clinical specimens from our north american european phase iii clinical trial 
the project is being funded under a contract  which niaid awarded bbi biotech for seven years 
under a subcontract with bbi biotech  we will receive a gross amount of approximately  to support the establishment of the sample collection 
we recognized approximately  for the year ended december  in  we were awarded a grant from the nih to continue the development of a vaccine designed to prevent infection by hiv subtype c  the most widespread form of the virus 
the sbir fast track grant provides up to  for the development program 
we recognized approximately  for the year ended december  the nih grant will allow us to create and conduct laboratory tests of a subtype c vaccine that could be used alone in southern africa and india  or it could be combined with a vaccine against the b and e subtypes for regions of the world  such as china  where all three subtypes are in circulation 
in february  we and a group of south korean investors announced the formation of a joint venture  named celltrion  which intends to raise up to approximately million  consisting of up to approximately million in cash and an in kind investment of mammalian cell culture technology and production support valued at million  to build and operate a facility in incheon  south korea  to manufacture aidsvax 
the joint venture also intends to fund a capital contribution of million towards construction of a smaller facility in south san francisco to support licensure and commercial launch of aidsvax 
we believe that both facilities  once constructed  would be designed for commercial manufacture of aidsvax  if it proves safe and effective and is approved by the fda or other bio pharmaceutical products 
as part of our investment in the joint venture  we provided mammalian cell culture technology and biologics production expertise to the joint venture 
we currently are celltrion s single largest stockholder 
although we have no further funding obligation to celltrion  we are responsible for any additional capital equipment costs in excess of million  and certain costs related to the validation  operation and licensure of the manufacturing facility in south san francisco  california 
the south korean partners will provide the funding necessary to design and construct both facilities and to validate and operate the incheon facility 
after all planned rounds of financing are completed  our fully diluted ownership will be approximately 
as of december   the south korean investors had contributed approximately million in cash to celltrion of the million in cash that the joint venture agreement between us and celltrion  and secured a million loan with a korean bank 
as a result  we currently have a interest in the joint venture 
in september  we were awarded a contract from niaid to develop a new anthrax vaccine and to create a feasibility plan to manufacture an emergency stockpile of million doses 
the period of performance of the contract is from september  through december  niaid is expected to award a separate contract in to manufacture the stockpile 
under the initial phase of the niaid contract  we will be awarded million  upon satisfaction of certain milestones  to advance the development of a vaccine candidate initially developed by the usamriid 
if results from the first phase are positive  niaid may elect  at least days prior to december   to extend the contract 
if the contract were extended  we would be eligible for an additional million in as a continuation of the current contract to support a phase ii clinical trial 
during the fourth quarter of  we invoiced niaid a total of  however we were not able to recognize any revenue associated with this contract in  because attainment of contractual milestones set forth in the agreement had not been met 
we will recognize revenue based on the completion of milestones  which have been specified by niaid 
revenues and costs not to exceed revenues associated with milestones which have not been substantiated through objective evidence from naid  will be deferred on our balance sheet 
also in september  we were awarded a million task order to supply aidsvax b e under an existing general contract to develop hiv vaccines for a forthcoming phase iii trial in thailand funded by the nih and conducted by wrair 
there are two government options  if exercised  would increase the total contract award to million 
in february  the nih exercised the first option to take delivery of the first two thirds of the vaccine supply 
we expect that the nih will exercise their second option for the remaining balance of the vaccine supply in september the majority of the contract award will be earned in in october  the nih awarded us a sbir grant to characterize the sequences of the viruses responsible for recent hiv infections 
the viruses are being sequenced from blood specimens obtained from volunteers who became infected during their participation our north american european phase iii clinical trial and is intended to help identify subtype b virus variants that should be included in future vaccine formulations 
the grant award for the first phase of the grant is  we recognized approximately  in grant revenue for the year ended december  funding for the first year of the second phase is proposed at approximately  and we expect the grant will be awarded during the second quarter of future payments due under contractual obligations as of december are as follows non cancelable clinical trial operating leases expenses total and thereafter   total    we believe that our existing cash and cash equivalents and investment securities  together with investment income  the funds from our existing government contracts and grants  along with funds from other potential collaborative arrangements  will enable us to meet our forecasted expenditures through the anticipated completion of our thai phase iii clinical trial and through approximately november however  we will need to raise additional funds to support the necessary manufacturing and development programs if we apply for regulatory approval of the aidsvax vaccine and to support other business opportunities 
we will also need to raise additional capital if the thai phase iii clinical trials are delayed or more costly than currently anticipated  or if commercialization is delayed for any other reason 
our future capital requirements are also dependent on several other factors  including o the progress of other internal research and development projects  o the timing and ability to negotiate government contracts or grants  o the need for leasehold improvements to facilities and the purchase of additional capital equipment  o the ability to attract and negotiate business development opportunities  and o the timing of revenue  from our vaccine candidates 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise funds when needed  or that such funds will be available on satisfactory terms 
if we are unable to raise additional capital  we will need to scale back our research and development efforts 
we will restrict additional planned activities and operations  as necessary  to sustain operations and conserve cash resources 
at december   we had federal and california net operating loss carryforwards of approximately  and  the federal and california net operating loss carryforwards expire by and  respectively 
additionally  we have federal research credits  expiring through  of approximately  and california research credits  carrying forward indefinitely of approximately  there is significant uncertainty about our ability to realize these benefits and we have not reflected any deferred tax assets on our balance sheet 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities 
sfas addresses the recognition  measurement  and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas supersedes emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring  and requires liabilities associated with exit and disposal activities to be expensed as incurred 
sfas is effective for exit or disposal activities that we initiate after december  in november  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   regardless of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
the disclosure requirements in the interpretation are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we do not have any guarantees nor do we provide any guarantees for others 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in november  the fasb issued emerging issues task force referred to as eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf issue no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a company for arrangements under which it will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf issue no 
addresses when and how an arrangement involving multiple deliverables should be divided into separate units of accounting 
the provisions of eitf issue no 
will apply to revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of eitf issue no 
to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and provides alternative methods for accounting for a change by registrants to the fair value method of accounting for stock based compensation 
additionally  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas to require disclosure in the significant accounting policy footnote of both annual and interim financial statements of the method of accounting for stock based compensation and the related pro forma disclosures when the intrinsic value method continues to be used 
the statement is effective for fiscal years beginning after december   and disclosures are effective for fiscal years ending after december  we have included the disclosure in our financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued financial interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities fin 
the consolidation requirements of interpretation apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim periods beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply in all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established 
we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a material effect on our financial condition or results of operations 
impact of inflation the impact of inflation on our operations for the years ended december    and was not material 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk at december  and  our exposure to market rate changes is related primarily to our debt securities included in our investment portfolio 
we do not have any derivative financial instruments 
by policy  we invest in debt instruments of the us government  federal agencies and high quality corporate issuers  limit the amount of credit exposure to any one issuer  limit duration by restricting the term  and hold investments to maturity except under rare circumstances 
investments in both fixed rate and floating rate instruments carry a degree of interest rate risk 
fixed rate securities may have their fair market value adversely impacted due to a rise in interest rates  while floating rate securities may produce less income than expected if interest rates fall 
due in part to these factors  our future investment income may decrease due to changes in interest rates or due to losses we may suffer when securities decline in market value 
at december   we held government debt instruments and corporate obligations in the principal amount of  if market interest rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from levels at december   the fair value of our portfolio would decline by an immaterial amount 
our exposure to losses as a result of interest rate changes is managed through investing primarily in securities that mature in a period of one year or less 
we have exposure to foreign currency exchange risk primarily related to our conducting clinical trials in thailand 
thailand is currently considered an emerging economy 
a material increase in the value of thailand s currency against the us dollar could cause an increase in our expenses 
the majority of our contracts associated with conducting clinical trials in thailand are priced in baht 
as of december   we have incurred  in foreign exchange losses 
we do not expect that our foreign currency balance sheet exposure as of december  will result in a significant impact on our operations or cash flows
