corporate history 
since our inception in  we have capitalized on the popularity of themed collectibles and toys 
we became well known in the early s for our officially licensed collectible die cast replicas of popular race cars 
we capitalized on our status as a pioneer of this market to become a leading producer of other automotive die cast replicas 
these products were primarily sold in the mass retailer channel under our racing champions brand 
on april   an investor group led by willis stein partners  lp and some members of our management consummated a recapitalization transaction in which our foreign and domestic operations were combined 
this transaction was accounted for using the purchase method and provided us with a stronger platform to manage our business more effectively 
following several years of strong growth  we completed an initial public offering in june in the offering  we sold approximately million shares of common stock and received net proceeds of million

ertl is a premier producer and marketer of collectibles and toys focused on agricultural and heavy equipment die cast vehicle replicas  classic and high performance die cast vehicle replicas  custom imprint die cast vehicle replicas  preschool toys  collectible figures and hobby model kits 
the combination dynamically transformed us into the company now known as racing champions ertl 
integration initiatives 
during and  we focused on integrating our acquisitions  particularly ertl 
we implemented numerous initiatives to achieve synergies and cost savings from these acquisitions 
for example  we relocated certain tooling and production to china from mexico  combined offices and warehouses in the united states  hong kong and china  and eliminated excess facilities  consolidated back office and support functions and systems  simplified the organizational structure  eliminated redundant functions and right sized facilities across the combined entity  and eliminated unprofitable products and product lines 
in  we realized significant benefits from the integration  which reduced ertl s inventory and resulted in increased profitability and cash flow

for the years ended december   and  sales to mass retailers comprised  and  respectively  of our net sales 
our products are marketed and distributed in north america  europe and asia pacific 
international sales constituted less than of our net sales for each of the last three years 
we expect international sales to increase over the next several years as we expand our geographic reach 
our net sales have not been materially impacted by foreign currency fluctuations

our top five customers accounted for  and of our net sales in  and  respectively 
the john deere dealer network and wal mart  our largest customers  accounted for and of our net sales in  respectively 
other than the john deere dealer network and wal mart  no other customer accounted for more than of our net sales in  or we provide certain customers the option to take delivery of our products either in the united states or united kingdom with credit terms ranging from to days or directly in china with payment made by irrevocable letter of credit or wire transfer 
since direct sales from china reduce our distribution and administrative costs  we generally grant price discounts of to on these sales  which results in lower gross profit margins for these sales compared to sales related to shipments from the united states or united kingdom 
therefore  annual fluctuations in the mix of products shipped in the united states or united kingdom vs 
products delivered in china will affect year to year comparability of net sales and gross profit margins

products shipped in the united states or united kingdom due to the elimination of distribution and certain administrative costs

our business is highly seasonal due to high consumer demand for our products during the year end holiday season 
approximately of our net sales over the three years ended december  were generated in the second half of the year
