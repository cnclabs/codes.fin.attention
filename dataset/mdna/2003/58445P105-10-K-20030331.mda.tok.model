risk factors major news events events which dominate news broadcasts  such as the events of september th or the involvement by the united states in a war  may cause the company s clients to delay or not use the company s services for a particular project as such clients may determine that their messages may not receive item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued adequate attention in light of the coverage of other news events 
such circumstances could have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
susceptibility to general economic conditions the company s revenues are affected by its clients marketing communications spending and advertising budgets 
the company s revenues and results of operations may be subject to fluctuations based upon general economic conditions in the geographic locations where it offers its services or distributes its material 
if there were to be continued economic downturn or a continued recession in these geographic locations  then the company expects that business enterprises  including its clients and potential clients  could substantially and immediately reduce their marketing and communications budgets 
in the event of such an economic climate  there would be a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results  financial condition and ability to refinance its existing line of credit agreement 
competition the markets for the company s services are highly competitive 
the principal competitive factors affecting the company are effectiveness  reliability  price  technological sophistication and timeliness 
numerous specialty companies compete with the company in each of its service lines although no single company competes across all service lines 
some of the company s competitors or potential competitors have longer operating histories  longer client relationships and significantly greater financial  management  technological  sales  marketing and other resources than the company 
in addition  clients could perform internally all or certain of the services provided by the company rather than outsourcing such services 
the company could face competition from companies in related communications markets which could offer services that are similar or superior to those offered by the company 
in addition  national and regional telecommunications providers could enter the market with materially lower electronic delivery costs  and radio and television networks could also begin transmitting business communications separate from their news programming 
the company s ability to maintain and attract clients depends to a significant degree on the quality of services provided and its reputation among its clients and potential clients as compared to that of its competitors 
there can be no assurance that the company will not face increased competition in the future or that such competition will not have a material adverse effect on the company s business  operating results and financial condition 
new services the company must develop new services to remain competitive  maintain or grow market share and to operate in new markets 
there can be no assurance that the company will be successful in developing new services  or that those new services will meet customer needs 
as a result of the expenses incurred in developing new services and the potential inability of the company to market these services successfully  the company s operating results may be negatively affected 
provisions of our charter documents may have anti takeover effects that could prevent a change in control even if the change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders provisions of our amended and restated certificate of incorporation  by laws and delaware law could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire the company  even if doing so would be beneficial to our stockholders 
line of credit the company had a balance due under its line of credit of million with a due date of january  the company renewed the facility through april covenants under the line item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued of credit agreement require the company to meet certain financial ratios  including minimum tangible net worth and minimum earnings before depreciation  amortization  interest and other charges  as defined in the agreement 
while management believes the company is currently in compliance with the covenants under the line of credit agreement  there can be no assurance that the company will continue to be in compliance in the future 
in that event  the company may be required to raise additional funds in order to repay the outstanding balance under the line of credit and there can be no assurance that  if required  the company would be able to raise such funds on favorable terms  if at all 
capital requirements one or more of our businesses could require  or benefit from  additional investment beyond our current capability 
such additional funding could be raised by the company  or one or more of its business units separately  and could have the effect of diluting shareholders interests 
other risk factors other risk factors include our recent history of losses  our ability to achieve or maintain profitability  effectiveness of our cost reduction programs  our ability to develop new services and market acceptance of such services  such as teletrax  our ability to develop new products and services that keep pace with technology  our ability to develop and maintain successful relationships with critical vendors  the potential negative effects of our international operations on the company 
in addition  future acquisitions or divestitures and the absence of long term contracts with customers and vendors may adversely effect our operations and have an adverse effect on pricing  revenues  gross margins and our customer base 
critical accounting policies we have identified the policies below as significant to our business operations and the understanding of our results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect our reported and expected financial results

unbilled receivables are classified as a current asset 
advanced billings to clients in excess of revenue earned are recorded as deferred revenues and are classified as a current liability 
allowance for doubtful accounts management must make estimates of the uncollectibility of the company s accounts receivable 
management specifically analyzes accounts receivable  historical bad debt  customer item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations continued concentrations  customer creditworthiness and current trends when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
goodwill and intangible assets goodwill represents the excess of purchase price and related costs over the value assigned to the net tangible and intangible assets of businesses acquired 
in and  goodwill was amortized on a straight line basis over its expected useful life  not to exceed years  and we periodically reviewed the recoverability of goodwill and intangible assets 
effective january   we adopted the provisions of financial accounting standards board fasb statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  which required us to ceased amortizing goodwill and to assess goodwill for impairment at least annually in the absence of an indicator of possible impairment and immediately upon an indicator of possible impairment 
the annual impairment testing required by sfas no 
will also requires the company to use its judgment and could require the company to write down the carrying value of its goodwill and other intangible assets in future periods 
other intangible assets  including customer lists and covenants not to compete  are being amortized on a straight line basis over the term of the agreement or the estimated future period of benefit  which ranges from to years 
the agreements pursuant to which the company acquired certain companies include provisions that could require the company to issue additional cash or shares of common stock if certain performance targets are met 
the value of any such additional consideration will be added to the goodwill related to such acquisition 
long lived assets long lived assets and certain identifiable intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of an asset may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets to be held and used is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by the asset 
if such assets are considered to be impaired  the impairment to be recognized is measured by the amount by which the carrying amount of the assets exceeds the fair value of the assets 
assets to be disposed of are reported at the lower of the carrying amount or fair value less costs to sell 
income taxes income taxes are accounted for under the asset and liability method 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for the future tax consequences attributable to differences between the financial statement carrying amounts of existing assets and liabilities and their respective tax bases and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured using enacted tax rates expected to apply to taxable income in the years in which those temporary differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
the effect on deferred tax assets and liabilities of a change in tax rates is recognized in income in the period that includes the enactment date 
we considered all of the available evidence to arrive at our position on the net deferred tax assets  however  should circumstances change which would alter our judgment in this regard it may have an impact on future operating results

this statement addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies emerging issues task force issue eitf  liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the principal difference between statement and eitf relates to the timing of liability recognition 
under statement  a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity is recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of an entity s commitment to an exit plan

fin requires a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
a variable interest entity is a corporation  partnership  trust  or any other legal structures used for business purposes that either a does not have equity investors with voting rights or b has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property

the consolidation requirements of fin apply immediately to variable interest entities created after january  the consolidation requirements apply to older entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  certain of the disclosure requirements apply to all financial statements issued after january   regardless of when the variable interest entity was established
