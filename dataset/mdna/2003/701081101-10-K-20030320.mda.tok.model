item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations results of operations outlook and overview the year was marked by an overall decline in rig activity and cash flow for the company 
the company incurred a net loss of million before the cumulative effect of the change in accounting principle  compared to net income of million in rig utilization  dayrates and rental activity decreased substantially in the company s gulf of mexico drilling markets  continuing a trend that started in the fourth quarter of the company s international markets began to improve late in  experiencing significantly higher utilization in the fourth quarter  most notably in the asia pacific region and kazakhstan  however  these gains were partially offset in by reduced drilling activity in latin america  primarily colombia and bolivia  and downtime due to barge rig inspections and refurbishments in nigeria 
after reaching  during  the highest levels of dayrates and utilization since the fall of  the gulf of mexico drilling market began to soften during the fourth quarter of the reduction in drilling activity by operators was in response to declining demand and prices for natural gas  due in part to the economic recession in the united states 
this reduced level of activity continued through even as the price for crude oil and natural gas increased  due to the lack of acceptable well prospects and funding issues 
due to the reduction in drilling activity in  barge rig utilization decreased from percent in to percent in utilization for the jackup rigs increased during the second half of to percent  slightly higher than the percent in negating the increase in utilization was a percent decline in average dayrates for as compared to the company s rental tool business experienced a similar reduction in activity beginning in late that continued throughout rental tool revenues declined in by million and profit margins decreased from percent in to percent in our drilling operations in the cis  which includes kazakhstan and russia  are a significant part of our current international operations and the company believes the region has potential for additional growth in the future 
since  our operations in kazakhstan have grown from providing labor to our principal customer to owning or managing drilling rigs for several operators 
in the last few years  the government of kazakhstan has requested that vendors incorporate local content into their operations to stimulate the development of a local oil and gas service industry and the kazakhstan economy 
in order to take advantage of the growth potential and remain a preferred vendor in kazakhstan  it was advantageous for us to partner with a local company 
in june  pdcil entered into an agreement to sell two of its rigs in kazakhstan  and assign the contract associated with said rigs  to aralparker  a kazakhstan joint venture company owned percent by pdcil and percent by a kazakhstan company  aralnedra cjsc 
the sales price for the rigs was million  which represented the fair market value according to an appraisal by an independent third party appraiser 
the purchase of the rigs by aralparker was financed by parker drilling over a five year period and is collateralized by a lien on the rigs and a security interest in the five year drilling contract and its proceeds 
the transaction closed on august  in addition  pdcil will lease a third rig to aralparker  and will operate the joint venture company pursuant to a management and technical services contract 
in light of the company s significant influence over the business affairs of aralparker  its financial statements are consolidated with the company s financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles 
although aralnedra effectively owns percent of the two rigs  pdcil will receive approximately percent of the cash flow generated by the current five year drilling contract  effective february  through the proceeds of repayment of the loan and the management and technical services contract 
outlook and overview continued in november   the company and aralparker received notification from tco to suspend drilling operations upon completion of wells being drilled in kazakhstan s tengiz field pending agreement on funding issues facing the tco partners 
on january   the company and aralparker received notification to resume normal drilling operations in the tengiz field  except for a labor contract on a tco owned rig 
while we received notification of the suspension in mid november  the rigs and crews were instructed to continue drilling wells in progress as of the date of the suspension notice 
as a result  operations continued at near normal operating rates throughout most of the suspension period  resulting in a minimal financial impact to the company and aralparker 
during  cash flow from operations declined million to million due primarily to the reduced drilling and rental tool activity 
in response to the decrease in cash flow from operations  the company significantly reduced capital expenditures for to million as compared to million in as a result  the company s cash position remained substantially the same from to management anticipates that working capital needs and funds required for capital spending in will be met with cash provided by operations 
based on anticipated cash requirements for capital spending of approximately million in  it is management s current intention to hold capital expenditures at this reduced level and to apply available free cash flow to repay long term debt 
the amount of debt that can be repaid is dependent on the results of operations and the proceeds from the sale of assets in should new opportunities requiring additional capital arise  that are not contemplated in management s current capital expenditure budget  the company will utilize existing cash and short term investments and  if necessary  borrowings under its revolving credit facility 
in addition  the company may seek project financing or equity participation from outside alliance partners or customers 
the company cannot predict whether such financing or equity participation would be available on terms acceptable to the company 
during the company s fourth quarter conference call with investors  management confirmed its previously announced guidance for of a net loss range of to per share 
this estimate is based on management s belief that both dayrates and utilization will increase modestly during the last three quarters of the year on the basis that current prices and expected demand for oil and gas will stimulate an increase in drilling activity 
also  during the conference call the company announced a plan to sell assets by mid year 
though the exact assets targeted for sale were not identified  management believes that these assets targeted for sale will generate million in net proceeds after transaction fees and taxes  which will be used to reduce long term debt 
the company has retained an investment banker to assist with the sale of assets  but has not entered into any sales agreements at this time 
the guidance for does not reflect the impact of any asset sales 
results of operations continued year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company recorded a net loss of million  for the year ended december  before the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle  compared to net income of million for the year ended december  the change in accounting principle related to the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
goodwill and other intangible assets resulted in recording the impairment of goodwill  effective the first quarter of in the amount of million 
year ended december  drilling and rental revenues dollars in thousands us drilling   international drilling   rental tools   total drilling and rental revenues   the company s revenues decreased million from million in to million for the year ended december  this reduction in revenues was attributed to reduced drilling activity world wide  most notably in the gulf of mexico  due to the economic downturn in the united states and increased inventories of oil and natural gas 
u 
s drilling revenues decreased million in to million due primarily to decreased dayrates for all us offshore drilling rigs and reduced utilization for the barge drilling rigs 
the gulf of mexico market declined significantly during the fourth quarter of and continued throughout due primarily to a reduction in drilling activity by operators 
this reduction in drilling activity was in response to declining demand and prices for natural gas and the economic recession in the united states that began during mid although prices for natural gas have risen  uncertainty regarding the economy and international issues has caused operators to be hesitant to significantly increase drilling at this time 
revenues for the barge rigs and jackup rigs decreased million and million  respectively  during the current year as compared to utilization for the barge rigs decreased from percent in to percent in with a percent decrease in dayrates 
the seven jackup rigs experienced a percent decrease in average dayrates during as compared to  utilization for the jackups remained relatively constant in year to year comparisons 
revenues for the platform rigs decreased million to million  as all four platform rigs were stacked the last three quarters of international drilling revenues decreased million to million in the current year as compared to december  international land drilling revenues increased million to million during as compared to the cis and asia pacific region both increased revenues during results of operations continued revenues in the cis region increased million in revenues increased million in the company s tengiz operations in as compared to primarily due to increased utilization 
revenues from the company s interest in saipar  bv  the company s joint venture with saipem  a drilling subsidiary of eni spa  operating in the karachaganak field of kazakhstan  increased million due to increased rig lease rates in and from early termination fees for rigs released by the operator in july and december 
the early termination fees totaled million 
currently the company has one rig working in the karachaganak field 
revenues increased in the asia pacific region by million related primarily to increased utilization and dayrates in papua new guinea 
additionally  the company increased the number of labor contracts in kuwait from two rigs in to six rigs in latin america revenues decreased by million in as compared to the decreases are primarily related to low utilization in colombia and bolivia 
during the fourth quarter of  colombia and bolivia had six rigs and one rig working  respectively 
at december   colombia had three rigs working and bolivia had no rig activity 
in colombia  we had four drilling rigs working for a customer when the operator terminated all drilling activity in may of since then one rig has gone back to work for this particular customer 
we are currently marketing the rigs in colombia and elsewhere in the world to replace the terminated contracts 
the drilling market in bolivia  which diminished significantly in mid  showed no signs of recovery throughout  primarily due to reduced demand for natural gas from brazil 
contributing to the reduced demand in are delays in receiving the bolivian government s commitment to a new gas pipeline to the west coast of south america to enable the exporting of natural gas to mexico and the united states 
revenues in bolivia decreased million to million in international offshore drilling revenues decreased million to million when compared to  primarily attributable to nigeria 
during the second and third quarters  two of the company s four barge rigs operating in nigeria incurred downtime for required american bureau of shipping abs inspections and repairs that resulted in a combined total of five months with no revenues 
shortly after returning to work the drilling contracts for these two barge rigs concluded and only one contract has subsequently been renewed 
at december   three of the four barge rigs were drilling 
results of operations continued rental tool revenues decreased million due to the decline in drilling activity in the gulf of mexico and decreased land drilling in west texas  which reduced the demand for rental tools 
revenues decreased million in the new iberia operations  million in the victoria  texas  operations and million from the odessa  texas  operations 
quail tools opened a new operation in evanston  wyoming  in july  which contributed million in revenues in year ended december  drilling and rental profit margins dollars in thousands us drilling   international drilling   rental tools   total drilling and rental profit margins   depreciation and amortization   net construction contract operating income  general and administration expense   provision for reduction in carrying value of certain assets  reorganization expense  total operating income   drilling and rental profit margin drilling and rental revenues less direct drilling and rental operating expenses  drilling and rental profit margin percentages drilling and rental profit margin as a percent of drilling and rental revenues 
profit margin of million in the current period reflects a decrease of million from the million recognized during the year ended december  the us and international drilling segments recorded profit margin percentages of percent and percent  respectively  in as compared to percent and percent in us profit margins decreased million to million for the year ended december  due to declining revenues as discussed above 
in response to declining revenues  us operations instituted cost controls for labor  materials and supplies 
as a result  the profit margin percentage increased during the fourth quarter to percent from percent during the third quarter on comparable revenues 
results of operations continued international drilling profit margin increased million to million during the current year ended december  as compared to international land drilling profit margin increased million to million 
profit margin in the cis region increased million with kazakhstan and russia operations each increasing profit margin by approximately million 
the kazakhstan increase is primarily attributable to increased utilization in the tengiz field and the early termination fees received for the two rigs released that were previously operating in the karachaganak field 
the profit margin increase in russia is due to higher than anticipated mobilization and start up costs incurred in that resulted in a significant loss 
asia pacific region s profit margin increased million to million during the current year 
improvement in asia pacific is primarily related to increased revenues in papua new guinea that resulted in increased profit margin of million 
latin america s profit margin declined million primarily due to decreased drilling activity in colombia and bolivia 
as noted previously  revenues in colombia and bolivia decreased million and million  respectively  for the year ended december  as compared to the decreased profit margins in colombia and bolivia were partially offset by increased profit margins in ecuador and peru 
the contract in ecuador was completed in the third quarter of and the rig is currently stacked in houston 
the contract in peru will continue through international offshore drilling profit margins decreased million to million during the current year 
this decrease in profit margin is primarily attributed to nigeria where two of the four barge rigs incurred a combined total of five months downtime during the second and third quarters due to abs inspections and repairs 
in addition  these two rigs both completed their respective contracts toward the end of the third quarter and only one contract was renewed in the fourth quarter 
currently the company is operating three of four barge rigs in nigeria 
rental tool profit margin decreased million to million during as compared to the year ended december  profit margin decreased primarily due to the million decline in revenues during the current year 
the profit margin percentage decreased during the current year to percent from percent for due to the significant fixed costs related to the rental tool operation 
during the first quarter of  the company announced a new contract to build and operate a rig to drill extended reach wells to offshore targets from a land based location on sakhalin island  russia for an international consortium 
the revenue and expense for the project are recognized as construction contract revenue and expense 
the estimated profit from the engineering  construction  mobilization and rig up fees is calculated on a percentage of completion basis  of which million was recognized during the year ended december  general and administrative expense increased million to million for the year ended december  the increase is primarily due to severance costs related to reductions in corporate personnel  significant increase in the vacation accrual  professional fees and required maintenance on the former corporate headquarters in tulsa currently held for sale 
with regards to the vacation accrual the company adopted a paid time off policy in  significantly increasing the required vacation accrual 
the million provision for reduction in carrying value of certain assets is to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts for a us customer who filed for bankruptcy protection during the second quarter of the million of reorganization costs recorded in includes employee moving expenses and severance costs related to the consolidation and relocation of the company s corporate and international drilling management to houston  texas  from tulsa  oklahoma 
the reorganization of certain senior management positions and management of drilling operations accompanied the relocation 
results of operations continued interest expense decreased million in compared to savings of million associated with the three million interest rate swap agreements including million from the amortization of gain on the termination of the interest rate swap agreements were offset by million less interest capitalized and million higher interest due to the higher interest rate on the exchange notes 
other expense of million for the year ended december  includes million related to the exchange offer see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements and million of costs incurred for the attempted purchase of australia oil and gas 
income tax expense for the year ended december  consists of foreign tax expense of million and a deferred tax benefit of million 
foreign taxes increased million due primarily to million paid during the first quarter in colombia related to a change in allowable depreciation in the tax return and increased taxes in the kazakhstan and the asia pacific regions 
the deferred tax benefit was recognized due to the loss generated during the current year 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  the company recorded net income of million  for the year ended december   compared to a net loss of million  before extraordinary gain  recorded for the year ended december  year ended december  drilling and rental revenues dollars in thousands us drilling   international drilling   rental tools   total drilling and rental revenues   the company s revenues increased million to million in as compared to us offshore drilling revenues increased million to million due primarily to increased dayrates for the drilling barge rigs and the jackup rigs 
dayrates increased percent and percent for the barge rigs and jackup rigs  respectively  as compared to the previous year 
the increase in dayrates was partially offset by decreased utilization from percent in to percent in for the jackup rigs 
the decrease in utilization was due primarily to the slowdown in the gulf of mexico jackup market during the fourth quarter of jackup utilization during the fourth quarter was percent as compared to approximately percent during the first three quarters of us land drilling revenues decreased million due to the sale of the company s last remaining us land rig  rig  in november results of operations continued international drilling revenues increased million to million in as compared to the year ended december  international land drilling revenues increased million to million during revenues in the cis region  which includes kazakhstan and russia  increased million to million during as compared to the previous year 
kazakhstan increased million in as one rig was added to the tengiz operation and three rigs were added to the karachaganak joint venture with saipem 
russia increased by million as one rig commenced operations during revenues increased million in the asia pacific region due primarily to increased rig utilization in indonesia  papua new guinea and new zealand 
offsetting these increases were decreases in revenues from madagascar and nigeria s land rig due to completion of drilling contracts in these countries in revenues in the latin america region decreased million to million during revenues in bolivia decreased million during due primarily to an oversupply of natural gas in bolivia due to reduced demand for bolivian natural gas from brazil  resulting in a significant decrease in rig utilization 
partially offsetting the decrease in bolivia was an increase in revenues of million in colombia 
during rig utilization increased in colombia to percent from percent in international offshore drilling revenues increased million to million during as compared to revenues in the caspian sea barge rig decreased by million while revenues in nigeria increased million 
barge rig revenues decreased primarily due to reduced rates received during the lengthy rig move after completion of the first well 
revenues for the four barge rigs in nigeria improved due to increased drilling operations on full dayrates 
in the rigs were on reduced standby rates for approximately six months due to several episodes of community unrest 
rental tool revenues increased million in as compared to due to the increased level of drilling activity in the gulf of mexico 
contributing to this increase was the new iberia  louisiana  operation in the amount of million  million from the victoria  texas  operation and million from the odessa  texas  operation which commenced operations in may year ended december  dollars in thousands drilling and rental profit margins us drilling   international drilling   rental tools   total drilling and rental profit margins   depreciation and amortization   general and administration expense   provision for reduction in carrying value of certain assets  reorganization expense  total operating income   drilling and rental profit margin drilling and rental revenues less direct drilling and rental operating expenses  drilling and rental profit margin percentages drilling and rental profit margin as a percent of drilling and rental revenues 
results of operations continued profit margin of million in reflected an increase of million from the million recognized during the year ended december  the us and international drilling segments recorded profit margin percentages during of percent and percent  respectively  as compared to percent and percent in us profit margins increased million 
us drilling profit margin was positively impacted during by increasing dayrates in the gulf of mexico from the barge and jackup rigs 
average dayrates for the barge rigs and jackup rigs increased approximately percent and percent  respectively  in as compared to the prior year 
jackup rig utilization decreased from percent in to percent in due primarily to a slowdown in the gulf of mexico jackup market during the fourth quarter  which resulted in jackup rig utilization of percent 
this slowdown negatively impacted jackup rig dayrates  which declined approximately percent from the first three quarters of international drilling profit margin increased million to million during the year ended december  as compared to international land drilling profit margin increased million to million 
profit margin for the international land drilling operations increased in kazakhstan from percent to percent  papua new guinea from percent to percent  and new zealand from percent to percent  primarily due to higher utilization during profit margin in russia decreased million due to higher than anticipated mobilization and start up costs 
the international offshore drilling profit margin increased million to million  with profit margin increasing from percent to percent during as compared to rental tool profit margin increased million to million during as compared to the year ended december  profit margin increased primarily due to the million increase in revenues during the profit margin percentage increased during to percent from percent for the previous year due principally to higher revenues without a corresponding increase in fixed cost 
depreciation and amortization expense increased million to million in depreciation expense recorded in connection with capital additions for the years  and  was the primary reason for the increase 
general and administrative expenses increased million in as compared to this increase was primarily attributed to increased travel costs  professional fees  information technology projects and higher occupancy costs associated with the new corporate office in houston 
the company recognized million in reorganization costs  which includes employee moving expenses and severance costs  during in september  the company opened its new corporate office in houston 
the reorganization included the consolidation of its corporate and international drilling activities from tulsa  oklahoma  with its us offshore drilling operations already domiciled in houston 
the reorganization of certain senior management positions and the management of drilling operations accompanied the relocation 
interest expense decreased million due to the million repayment of convertible notes during the fourth quarter of and million of interest being capitalized to construction projects during the year ended december   as compared to million capitalized during gain on disposition of assets decreased million to million for the year ended december  during the year  the company sold its one million shares of unit corporation common stock and recognized a pre tax gain of million and the company sold rig in alaska for million and recognized a pre tax gain of million 
results of operations continued income tax expense for consists of foreign tax expense of million and deferred tax benefit of million 
the deferred tax benefit is due to the reduction in the valuation allowance of million offsetting deferred tax expense of million 
the reduction was the result of a change in estimate relating to the realization of net operating loss carryforwards nol s 
at december   the company carried a valuation account reserving part of the nol s set to expire during the tax year ended august  due to higher than projected taxable income for the tax year  the company utilized more nol s than originally anticipated resulting in the deferred tax benefit

the company has total long term debt  including the current portion  of million at december  the company has a million revolving credit facility with a group of banks led by bank of america 
this facility is available for working capital requirements  general corporate purposes and to support letters of credit 
the revolver is collateralized by accounts receivable  inventory and certain barge rigs located in the gulf of mexico 
the facility contains customary affirmative and negative covenants 
availability under the revolving credit facility is subject to certain borrowing base limitations based on percent of eligible receivables plus percent of supplies in inventory  less the amount utilized in support of letters of credit 
currently  the borrowing base of million is reduced by million in outstanding letters of credit  resulting in available revolving credit of million

the revolver terminates on october  the company expects to renew or replace the revolving loan facility by the end of the third quarter of liquidity and capital resources continued the company anticipates that funds required for capital spending in will be met from existing cash and cash provided by operations 
it is management s present intention to limit capital spending  net of reimbursements from customers  to approximately million in should new drilling projects or other opportunities requiring additional capital arise  or should revenues not meet management s expectations  the company may utilize the revolving credit facility 
in addition  the company may seek project financing or equity participation from outside alliance partners or customers to fund certain capital projects

the company has no energy or commodity contracts 
other matters business risks internationally  the company specializes in drilling geologically challenging wells in locations that are difficult to access and or involve harsh environmental conditions 
the company s international services are primarily utilized by major and national oil companies in the exploration and development of reserves of oil 
in the united states  the company primarily drills offshore in the gulf of mexico with barge  jackup and platform rigs for major and independent oil and gas companies 
business activity is dependent on the exploration and development activities of the major  independent and national oil and gas companies that make up the company s customer base 
generally  temporary fluctuations in oil and gas prices do not materially affect these companies exploration and development activities  and consequently do not materially affect the operations of the company  except for the gulf of mexico  where drilling contracts are generally for a shorter term  and oil and gas companies tend to respond more quickly to upward or downward changes in prices 
many international contracts are of longer duration and oil and gas companies have committed to longer term projects to develop reserves and thus our international operations are not as susceptible to short term fluctuations in prices 
however  sustained increases or decreases in oil and natural gas prices could have an impact on customers long term exploration and development activities  which in turn could materially affect the company s operations 
generally  a sustained change in the price of oil would have a greater impact on the company s international operations while a sustained change in the price of natural gas would have a greater effect on us operations 
due to the locations in which the company drills  the company s operations are subject to interruption  prolonged suspension and possible expropriation due to political instability and local community unrest 
further  the company is exposed to liability issues from pollution arising out of its operations and to loss of revenues in the event of a blowout 
the majority of the political and environmental risks are transferred to the operator by contract or otherwise insured 
critical accounting policies the company considers certain accounting policies related to impairment of property  plant and equipment  impairment of goodwill  the valuation of deferred tax assets and revenue recognition to be critical accounting policies due to the estimation processes involved in each 
other significant accounting policies are summarized in note in the notes to the consolidated financial statements 
impairment of property  plant and equipment management periodically evaluates the company s property  plant and equipment to determine that their net carrying value is not in excess of their net realizable value 
these evaluations are performed when the company has realized sustained significant declines in utilization and dayrates and recovery is not contemplated in the near future 
management considers a number of factors such as estimated future cash flows  appraisals and current market value analysis in determining net realizable value 
assets are written down to their fair value if it is below its net carrying value 
impairment of goodwill management periodically assesses whether the excess of cost over net assets acquired is impaired based on the estimated fair value of the operation to which it relates  which value is generally determined based on estimated future cash flows of that operation 
if the estimated fair value is in excess of the carrying value of the operation  no further analysis is performed 
if the fair value of each operation  to which goodwill has been assigned  is less than the carrying value  we will deduct the fair value of the tangible and intangible assets and compare the residual amount to the carrying value of the goodwill to determine if an impairment should be recorded 
other matters continued in  sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  became effective and as a result  the company discontinued the amortization of million of goodwill 
the company recorded million of goodwill amortization in and and would have recorded million of goodwill amortization during in lieu of amortization  the company performed an initial impairment review of goodwill and as a result impaired goodwill by million 
the company will perform an annual impairment review  in december  hereafter 
the impairment was recognized as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements for additional information 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate the income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which the company operates 
this process involves estimating the actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as depreciation  amortization and certain accrued liabilities for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences and the net operating loss carryforwards result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that the deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income  and to the extent the company believes that recovery is not likely  the company must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases or decreases this allowance in a period  the company must include an expense or reduction of expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
revenue recognition the company recognizes revenues and expenses on dayrate contracts as the drilling progresses percentage of completion method because the company does not bear the risk of completion of the well 
for meterage contracts  the company recognizes the revenues and expenses upon completion of the well completed contract method 
revenues from rental activities are recognized ratably over the rental term which is generally less than six months

sfas no 
does require certain new disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements 
the required annual disclosures are effective immediately and have been included in note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements included in item the new interim disclosure provisions will be effective in the first quarter of in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantee of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
fin s provisions for initial recognition and measurement should be applied on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the guarantor s previous accounting for guarantees that were issued before the date of fin s initial application may not be revised or restated to reflect the effect of the recognition and measurement provisions of the interpretation 
the disclosure requirements are effective for financial statements of both interim and annual periods that end after december  the company is not a guarantor under any significant guarantees and thus this interpretation will not have a significant effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
on january   the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of accounting research bulletin no 
the primary objectives of fin are to provide guidance on how to identify entities for which control is achieved through means other than through voting rights variable interest entities vie and how to determine when and which business enterprise should consolidate the vie 
this new model for consolidation applies to an entity in which either the equity investors do not have a controlling financial interest or the equity investment at risk is insufficient to finance that entity s activities without receiving additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
see note of the notes to the consolidated financial statements regarding our consolidation of aralparker  a company in which we own a percent equity interest 
we are consolidating this company because we exert significant influence and have a financial interest in the form of a loan  in addition to our equity interest
