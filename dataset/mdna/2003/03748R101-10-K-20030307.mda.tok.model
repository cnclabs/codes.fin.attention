item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview the following discussion and analysis of the results of operations and financial condition of the company should be read in conjunction with the financial statements incorporated by reference in item of this annual report 
the following discussion of results of operations is based on net income calculated under accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  or gaap 
in addition to net income  we measure our economic profitability based on funds from operations  or ffo  less capital replacement and capital enhancement spending  which we refer to as adjusted funds from operations  or affo 
see the discussion of ffo and affo as supplemental measurements under the heading funds from operations in this item critical accounting policies and estimates the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with gaap  which require us to make estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following critical accounting policies  among others  involve our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
impairment of long lived assets real estate and other long lived assets are recorded at cost  less accumulated depreciation  unless considered impaired 
if events or circumstances indicate that the carrying amount of a property may be impaired  we will make an assessment of its recoverability by estimating the undiscounted future cash flows  excluding interest charges  of the property 
if the carrying amount exceeds the aggregate undiscounted future cash flows  we would recognize an impairment loss to the extent the carrying amount exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
real estate investments are subject to varying degrees of risk 
several factors may adversely affect the economic performance and value of our real estate investments 
these factors include the general economic climate  competition from other apartment communities and other housing options  local conditions  such as an increase in unemployment or an increase in the supply of apartments  that might adversely affect apartment occupancy or rental rates  changes in governmental regulations and the related cost of compliance  and changes in market rental rates 
any adverse changes in these factors could cause an impairment in our assets  including real estate and investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
notes receivable and interest income recognition we generally recognize interest income earned from our investments in notes receivable when the collectibility of such amounts is both probable and estimable 
the notes receivable were either extended by us and are carried at the face amount plus accrued interest par value notes or were made by predecessors whose positions we acquired usually at a discount discounted notes 
we continue to assess the collectibility or impairment of each note on a periodic basis 
under the cost recovery method  we carry the discounted notes at the acquisition amount  less subsequent cash collections  until such time as collectibility of principal and interest is probable and the timing and amounts are estimable 
based upon closed or pending transactions which include sales  refinancing  foreclosures and rights offerings  we have determined that certain notes are collectible for amounts greater than their carrying value 
accordingly  we are recognizing accretion income  on a prospective basis over the estimated remaining life of the loans  as the difference between the carrying value of the discounted notes and the estimated collectible value 
if we had not been able to complete certain transactions  our accretion income would have decreased by million for the year ended december  accretion income recognized in any given period is based on the ability to complete transactions to monetize the notes receivable and the difference between the carrying value and the estimated collectible value of the notes  therefore  accretion income in future periods could vary and could result in lower accretion income than in prior periods 
allowance for losses on notes receivable in estimating the collectibility of notes receivable  management s judgment is required in assessing the ultimate realization of these receivables including the current credit worthiness of each borrower 
allowances are based on management s opinion of an amount that is adequate to absorb losses in the existing portfolio 
the allowance for losses on notes receivable is established through a provision for loss based on management s evaluation of the risk inherent in the notes receivable portfolio  the composition of the portfolio  specific impaired notes receivable and current economic conditions 
such evaluation  which includes a review of notes receivable on which full collectibility may not be reasonably assured  considers among other matters  full realizable value or the fair value of the underlying collateral  economic conditions  historical loss experience  management s estimate of probable credit losses and other factors that warrant recognition in providing for an adequate allowance for losses on notes receivable 
during the years ended december  and  we identified and recorded million and no losses on notes receivable  respectively 
we will continue to monitor and assess these notes and changes in required reserves may occur in the future due to changes in the market environment 
capitalized costs we capitalize direct and indirect costs including salaries  interest  real estate taxes and other costs incurred in connection with redevelopment  initial capital expenditures  capital enhancement and capital replacement activities 
indirect costs that do not relate to the above activities  including general and administrative expenses  are charged to expense as incurred 
the amounts capitalized depend on the volume  timing and costs of such activities 
as a result  changes in costs and activities may have a significant effect on our results of operations and cash flows if the costs being capitalized are not proportionately increased or reduced  as the case may be 
based on the level of capital spending during  if capital activities had decreased during the year by  we could have had additional operating expenses of between million and million 
additionally  if capital activities had increased during the year by  we could have had lower operating expenses of between million and million 
see further discussion under the heading capital expenditures 
results of operations comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  net income we recognized net income of million  and net income attributable to common stockholders of million  for the year ended december   compared to net income of million  and net income attributable to common stockholders of million  for the year ended december  net income attributable to common stockholders represents net income less dividends accrued on preferred stock for that period 
the following paragraphs discuss the results of operations in detail 
consolidated rental property operations rental and other property revenues from our consolidated properties totaled  million for the year ended december   compared with  million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
this increase in consolidated rental and other property revenues was principally a result of the following million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in  ten months of operations of the properties acquired through the casden merger and four months of operations of the properties acquired in the new england properties acquisition in  million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in  and the subsequent consolidation of  real estate partnerships 
these real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated at the end of  one property that was first consolidated in the second quarter of  properties that were first consolidated in the third quarter of and properties that were first consolidated in the fourth quarter of  million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of apartment properties in results of dispositions were included in discontinued operations  and million of an offsetting decrease related to a decrease in same store revenues 
see further discussion of same store results under the heading conventional same store property operating results 
property operating expenses for our consolidated properties  consisting of on site payroll costs  utilities net of reimbursements received from residents  contract services  property management fees  turnover costs  repairs and maintenance  advertising and marketing  property taxes and insurance  totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase in property operating expenses was principally a result of the following million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in  ten months of operations of properties acquired in the casden merger and four months of operations of the properties acquired in the new england properties acquisition in  million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in  and the subsequent consolidation of  real estate partnerships 
these real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated at the end of  one property that was first consolidated in the second quarter of  properties that were first consolidated in the third quarter of and properties that were first consolidated in the fourth quarter of  million of the increase related to a increase in same store operating expense 
see further discussion of same store results under the heading conventional same store property operating results  million of the increase was related to properties in the redevelopment portfolio becoming ready for their intended use  and as a result certain operating expenses are no longer being capitalized  and million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of apartment properties in results of dispositions were included in discontinued operations 
consolidated investment management business income from the consolidated investment management business  which is primarily earned from unconsolidated real estate partnerships and the minority interest share of consolidated real estate partnerships  for which we are the general partner  was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
this decrease in income from the consolidated investment management business was principally a result of the following million of the decrease related to reduced fees billed for construction supervisory management services in these fees were calculated and billed to the real estate partnerships based on a percentage of volume of construction activities 
in addition  lower costs were incurred and therefore lower billings occurred as a result of the ongoing management initiative to contain costs  million of the decrease related to an increase in insurance costs in the property hazard program 
these increased costs were the result of historical claim losses from prior years  million of the decrease related to increased ownership in and number of consolidated real estate partnerships  which results in an additional elimination of management fee income and the associated property operating expense  million of the decrease related to a net reduction in fees including million decrease in refinancing and disposition fees  due to decreased refinancing transactions in compared to in resulting in lower fees earned  and million decrease in fees earned for services provided to third parties due to a planned reduction in third party asset management 
this decrease was offset by a million increase in asset management and developer fees related to the napico acquisition in  million of the decrease related to additional depreciation expense related primarily to the new site solutions hardware and software purchases in late and early  million of an offsetting increase related to the reduced amortization of intangibles  of which million was due to property management and asset management contract intangibles that were fully amortized in  and million was attributable to the elimination of goodwill amortization in accordance with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  and million of an offsetting increase related to lower compensation and health insurance expense resulting from a change in plan administrator and a reduction in work force  in part due to planned reduction in third party property management and management cost reduction initiatives 
consolidated general and administrative expenses consolidated general and administrative expenses of million for the year ended december  increased by million from the million of such expenses for the year ended december  this increase was principally a result of increased professional fees  primarily incurred in connection with the evaluation of the loan receivable portfolio 
consolidated other expenses consolidated other expenses were million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  in  these expenses included the following million related to payments in settlement of claims asserted against us  including litigation and arbitration  million related to the write off of costs related to potential acquisitions that were not completed  million was primarily related to severance and hiring costs  and costs associated with the transition of certain accounting functions from greenville  south carolina to our headquarters in denver  colorado  and million related to personnel costs associated with annual compensation 
in  we incurred million of other expenses comprised of consulting fees paid to a specialized third party vendor in connection with a systematic and comprehensive effort to improve our business processes and financial controls 
consolidated provision for losses on accounts  fees and notes receivable consolidated provision for losses on accounts  fees and notes receivable was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  in  all million related to provision for losses on notes receivable  which provision was determined based on our review in of the collectibility of each loan made to affiliated partnerships within our loan receivable portfolio 
we will continue to monitor these loans and assess the collectibility of each loan on a periodic basis 
in  there was no provision for losses on notes receivable as all million related to additional allowance for possible losses on accounts  fees and other contingencies 
consolidated depreciation of rental property consolidated depreciation of rental property decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was principally a result of the following million of the decrease related to the change in useful lives of assets made in  which was consistent with management s expectations 
during  we completed a comprehensive review of our real estate related depreciation 
as a result of this review  we changed our estimate of the remaining useful lives for our buildings 
we believe the change better reflects the remaining useful lives of the assets and is consistent with prevailing industry practice 
this change in useful lives increased net income by approximately million  net of minority interest  in over  of which a portion was recognized as an increase to equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
the recognition of this change in useful lives resulted in an increase in basic and diluted earnings per share of and  respectively  for the year ended december   million of the decrease related to the disposition of apartment properties in results of dispositions were included in discontinued operations  million of an offsetting increase related to depreciation of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in  ten months of depreciation of the properties acquired in the casden merger and four months of depreciation of the properties acquired in the new england properties acquisition in  and million of an offsetting increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in  and the subsequent consolidation of  real estate partnerships 
these real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated at the end of  one property that was first consolidated in the second quarter of  properties that were first consolidated in the third quarter of and properties that were first consolidated in the fourth quarter of consolidated interest expense consolidated interest expense  which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs together with any prepayment penalties incurred  totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or 
the increase was principally a result of the following million of the increase related to interest on additional property debt acquired through three direct purchases in  ten months of interest on additional property debt acquired in the casden merger and four months of interest on the debt related to the new england properties acquisition in  million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in  and the subsequent consolidation of  real estate partnerships 
these real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated at the end of  one property that was first consolidated in the second quarter of  properties that were first consolidated in the third quarter of and properties that were first consolidated in the fourth quarter of  million of the increase related to increased interest expense on our revolving credit facility and term loan 
we had an average balance outstanding during the year ended december  of million including the casden loan  and an average balance outstanding for the year ended december  of million including the term loan we borrowed for the acquisition of interests in the oxford properties 
the cost of such borrowings was at a weighted average interest rate of compared to  respectively  million of an offsetting decrease related to an overall decrease in variable interest rates of approximately from the prior year  and million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of apartment properties in results of dispositions were included in discontinued operations 
consolidated interest and other income consolidated interest and other income increased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december  this increase was principally a result of the following million of the increase related to accretion income increasing from million  net of allocated expenses of million  for the year ended december   compared to million  net of allocated expenses of million  for the year ended december  this increase in accretion income was due to more completed transactions resulting in accretion occurring in than in  million of an offsetting decrease related to a decrease in recognized gain on certain tax exempt bonds that were held in and sold in the second quarter of  and million of an offsetting decrease related to lower interest on money market and interest bearing accounts  as interest rates on deposit accounts have decreased approximately from the prior year  while the average cash balances outstanding for both periods remained consistent 
equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships equity in earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships totaled million for the year ended december   compared with a loss of million for the year ended december   a change of million 
this change was principally due to the change in estimate of useful lives of the underlying real estate assets completed by us in  which resulted in lower depreciation expense of approximately million 
see the previous discussion on the change in estimate of useful lives of assets under the heading consolidated depreciation of rental property 
minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
this decrease is primarily a result of our purchase of additional interests in consolidated real estate partnerships and a reduction in net income  thereby reducing the minority interest allocation 
gain loss on dispositions of real estate loss on dispositions of real estate  primarily by unconsolidated entities  totaled million for the year ended december   compared to a gain of million for the year ended december   a change of million 
part of this change was a result of our adoption of statement of financial accounting standard no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets to be disposed of sfas effective january   where we now report assets held for sale as defined by sfas and assets sold in the current period  as discontinued operations 
due to this adoption  for the year ended december   gain loss on dispositions of real estate does not include any gain or loss associated with the disposal of consolidated properties that were classified as discontinued operations during for  however  gain loss on dispositions of real estate included gain or loss associated with the disposal of all properties sold 
the properties sold in both periods  as well as the properties held for sale  were considered by management to be inconsistent with our long term investment strategy 
gain loss on properties sold were determined on a property by property basis and are not entirely comparable year over year due to individual property differences 
included in gain loss on dispositions of real estate  we recorded a loss of approximately million 
this million loss resulted primarily from a change in estimate due to better insight into information related to the finalization of the recording of purchase price accounting to appropriate entities acquired in past acquisitions and the related historical estimation process in determining the carrying value of assets sold 
the recognition of this amount in the current period is considered to be a change in estimate associated with the historical estimated gain or loss on the sale of these properties 
the recognition of this change in estimate resulted in a decrease in basic and diluted earnings per share of for the year ended december  in addition to the million loss discussed above  we recorded approximately million of impairment losses on investments in unconsolidated real estate partnerships  offset by approximately million of net casualty gains 
distributions to minority partners in excess of income distributions to minority partners in excess of income decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  when real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions in excess of net income  generally accepted accounting principles require us  as the majority partner  to record a charge equal to the minority partners excess of distributions over net income when the partnership is in a deficit equity position  even though we do not suffer any economic effect  cost or risk 
this decrease was due to a reduced level of distributions being made by the consolidated real estate partnerships as a result of lower refinancing activity  and our increased ownership of such partnerships 
discontinued operations loss from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december   compared to income of million for the year ended december   a change of million 
as a result of the adoption of sfas  effective january   we now report assets classified as held for sale as defined by sfas and assets sold in the current period  as discontinued operations 
for the year ended december   discontinued operations included the operations of the properties sold and classified as held for sale in and the associated gain loss on the disposition of the properties 
for the year ended december   discontinued operations included the operations of the properties sold and classified as held for sale in there were no gains or losses on assets sold in included in discontinued operations for the year ended december  the change in discontinued operations was primarily related to a net loss on disposals of million for the year ended december  we incurred net losses of million from the sale of certain senior living facilities  which we deemed non strategic assets 
in addition  approximately million of impairment losses were recorded on properties that were classified as held for sale 
these losses were partially offset by million in net gains on the sale of other discontinued operations properties 
the properties sold  as well as the properties classified as held for sale  were considered by management to be inconsistent with our long term investment strategy 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for more details on discontinued operations 
comparison of the year ended december  to the year ended december  effective january   we began consolidating our previously unconsolidated subsidiaries see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report 
prior to this date  we had significant influence over  but did not have control of  such subsidiaries 
accordingly  such investments were accounted for under the equity method 
under the equity method  our pro rata share of the earnings or losses of the entity for the periods being presented was included in equity in losses of unconsolidated subsidiaries 
in order for a meaningful analysis of the financial statements to be made  the revenues and expenses for the unconsolidated subsidiaries for the year ended december   have been included in the following analysis as though they had been consolidated  and as a result the amounts are different than the historical information as previously reported 
all significant intercompany revenues and expenses have been eliminated

the following paragraphs discuss the results of operations in detail 
consolidated rental property operations rental and other property revenues from consolidated properties totaled  million for the year ended december   compared with  million for the year ended december   an increase of million  or

these real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated in and properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of  million of the increase related to a increase in same store revenues  and million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of properties in and properties after the first quarter of property operating expenses from our consolidated properties  consisting of on site payroll costs  utilities net of reimbursements received from residents  contract services  property management fees  turnover costs  repairs and maintenance  advertising and marketing  property taxes and insurance  totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase in consolidated property operating expenses was principally a result of the following million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in and operations of the properties acquired through the oxford acquisition and other properties acquired in the third and fourth quarters of  million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in  and the subsequent consolidation of  real estate partnerships 
these real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated in and properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of  million of the increase related to a increase in same store expenses  million of an offsetting decrease related to the capitalization of construction related costs  and million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of properties in and properties after the first quarter of consolidated investment management business income from the consolidated investment management business  which is primarily earned from unconsolidated real estate partnerships and the minority interest share of consolidated real estate partnerships  for which we are the general partner  was million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december   a decrease of million or 
this decrease in consolidated investment management business was principally a result of the following million of the decrease related to the reduction in the number of properties managed  including approximately for third parties  million of the decrease related to increased amortization of intangibles from additional property and asset management contract intangibles that were acquired as part of the acquisition of the oxford properties  million of the decrease related to losses from health and property casualty insurance claims  million of the decrease related to the increased ownership in controlled  consolidated partnerships  which requires additional elimination of management fee income and the associated property management expense  million of an offsetting increase related to fees resulting from additional construction supervisory management services in these fees were calculated and billed to the real estate partnerships based on a percentage of volume of construction activities  million of an offsetting increase related to increased capitalization of direct and indirect costs related to construction  redevelopment  capital enhancement and capital replacement activities  and million of an offsetting increase related to additional accounting and other fees earned from the oxford properties  which were acquired by us in september consolidated general and administrative and other expenses consolidated general and administrative expenses remained consistent  with million for the year ended december  compared with million for the year ended december  we incurred million of consulting fees paid to a specialized third party vendor for the year ended december  in connection with a systematic and comprehensive effort to improve our business processes and financial controls 
this effort resulted in identifying many initiatives to eliminate work and reduce costs 
three of the main themes were to increase focus on the operation of the conventional properties  strengthen corporate support to field operations and increase focus on the realization of equity values embedded in our portfolio of affordable properties 
in  we transferred affordable property management to a team separate from conventional property management  and reduced our business of providing property management services to unrelated third parties from  units at the end of to  units by the end of  in order to focus on the operation of conventional properties 
we have strengthened a number of our corporate functions including purchasing  which has provided for lower costs  marketing  to improve traffic  human resources  to improve the recruitment  training and retention of top performers  financial control  to provide more timely financial information  and information technology systems  which includes the pending installation of an on site property management program 
additionally  for the year ended december   we provided for an additional allowance of million for possible losses on accounts  fees and other contingencies 
consolidated depreciation of rental property consolidated depreciation of rental property totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase was principally a result of the following million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in and operations of the properties acquired through the oxford acquisition and other properties acquired in the third and fourth quarters of  million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in  and the subsequent consolidation of  real estate partnerships 
these real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated in and properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of  million of the increase related to depreciable additions to same store properties  million of an offsetting decrease related to the change in useful lives of assets 
during  we completed a comprehensive review of our real estate related depreciation 
as a result of this review  we changed our estimate of the remaining useful lives for our buildings 
effective july  for certain assets and october  for the majority of the portfolio  we extended useful lives of these assets from a weighted average composite life of years to a weighted average composite life of years 
this change increased net income by approximately million  net of minority interest  or per diluted share in we believe the change better reflects the remaining useful lives of the assets and is consistent with prevailing industry practice  and million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of properties in and properties after the first quarter of consolidated interest expense consolidated interest expense  which includes the amortization of deferred financing costs  totaled million for the year ended december   compared with million for the year ended december   an increase of million or 
this increase was principally a result of the following million of the increase related to operations of the properties acquired through three direct purchases in and operations of the properties acquired through the oxford acquisition and other properties acquired in the third and fourth quarters of  million of the increase related to the purchase of controlling interests in  and the subsequent consolidation of  real estate partnerships 
these real estate partnerships included six properties that were first consolidated in and properties that were first consolidated after the first quarter of  million of an offsetting decrease related to lower interest expense on our line of credit 
we had lower average balances outstanding during the year  and the cost of such borrowing was at a weighted average interest rate of for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december   million of an offsetting decrease related to a reduction in interest expense paid on our mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities  as approximately million and million of these securities were converted into common stock in late and in  respectively  and million of an offsetting decrease related to the disposition of properties in and properties occurring after the first quarter of consolidated interest and other income consolidated interest and other income decreased million or from million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  this decrease was principally the result of the following million of the decrease related to a reduction in accretion income of discounted notes from million  net of allocated expenses of million  for the year ended december  to million  net of allocated expenses of million  for the year ended december  this decrease in accretion income was due to fewer loans and fewer transactions completed that resulted in accretion income 
million of the decrease related to lower interest from money market and interest bearing accounts as interest rates on deposit accounts had decreased approximately basis points from the prior year  as well as we had lower average cash balances million in  compared to million in due to the paydown of certain obligations and distributions to minority interest partners 
million of an offsetting increase related to the gain recognized from the sale of certain tax exempt bonds 
equity in earnings losses of unconsolidated real estate partnerships equity in losses from unconsolidated real estate partnerships totaled million for the year ended december   compared to earnings of million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the acquisition of interests in the oxford properties in contributed million to the earnings of unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
however  this was offset by the purchase of additional partnership interests which resulted in the related properties being consolidated and contributing to consolidated rental revenues and expenses seven properties in and properties in 
minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships minority interest in consolidated real estate partnerships totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a change of million 
the change was primarily a result of our purchase of additional interests in real estate partnerships  thereby reducing the minority interest allocation 
distributions to minority partners in excess of income distributions to minority partners in excess of income increased million from million for the year ended december  to million for the year ended december  when real estate partnerships consolidated in our financial statements make cash distributions in excess of net income  generally accepted accounting principles require us  as the majority partner  to record a charge equal to the minority partners excess of distribution over net income when the partnership is in a deficit equity position  even though we do not suffer any economic effect  cost or risk 
the increase for the year occurred due to increased refinancing and operating activity  resulting in an increased amount of cash distributions to minority interest partners 
gain on dispositions of real estate gain on dispositions of real estate totaled million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december   a decrease of million 
the sales in both periods are of properties that are considered by management to be inconsistent with our long term investment strategy 
gains losses on properties sold were determined on a property by property basis and are not entirely comparable year over year due to individual property differences 
discontinued operations income from discontinued operations was million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a result of the adoption of sfas  effective january   we now report assets classified as held for sale as defined by sfas and assets sold in the current period  as discontinued operations 
this change has resulted in certain reclassifications of and financial statement amounts  as all results of operations for those properties sold or classified as held for sale in must be included in a separate component of income on the consolidated statements of income for all comparable periods 
for the year ended december  and  discontinued operations included the operations of the properties sold or classified as held for sale in there are no gains or losses on assets sold in or included in discontinued operations for the years ended december  and see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for more information on discontinued operations 
conventional same store property operating results we define same store properties as conventional apartment properties in which our ownership interest exceeds and operations are stabilized for over one year in the comparable periods of and total portfolio includes same store properties plus conventional acquisition and redevelopment properties 
the following table summarizes the unaudited conventional rental property operations on a same store and a total portfolio basis dollars in thousands conventional same store conventional total portfolio properties apartment units     average physical occupancy average rent collected unit month revenues expenses     net operating income     same store net operating income decreased million  or  for the year ended december  compared to the year ended december  revenues decreased million  or  primarily due to lower average rent down per unit  lower occupancy down  and increased bad debt  all of which were somewhat offset by an increase in ancillary income 
expenses increased by million  or  primarily due to an increase of million in property taxes as well as increased insurance expense of million as the cost of property hazard insurance coverage rose in march these increases were somewhat offset by reductions in other categories 
same store expenses for both periods presented above are net of capitalized costs 
the same store net operating results above represent and of total free cash flow for the years ended december  and  respectively 
funds from operations we believe that ffo and affo  when considered with the financial data determined in accordance with gaap  provide investors with an understanding of our ability to incur and service debt and make capital expenditures 
these supplemental measures capture real estate performance by recognizing that real estate generally appreciates over time or maintains residual value to a much greater extent than machinery  computers or other personal property 
the board of governors of the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit defines ffo as net income loss  computed in accordance with gaap  excluding gains and losses from extraordinary items  disposals of depreciable real estate property  net of related income taxes  plus real estate related depreciation and amortization excluding amortization of financing costs  including depreciation for unconsolidated real estate partnerships and joint ventures and discontinued operations 
we calculate ffo based on the nareit definition  as further adjusted for minority interest in the aimco operating partnership  plus amortization of intangibles  plus distributions to minority partners in excess of income and less dividends on preferred stock 
we calculate ffo diluted by adding back the interest expense and preferred dividends relating to convertible securities whose conversion is dilutive to ffo 
ffo should not be considered an alternative to net income or net cash flows from operating activities  as calculated in accordance with gaap  as an indication of our performance or as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is not necessarily indicative of cash available to fund future cash needs 
in addition  although ffo is a measure used for comparability in assessing the performance of real estate investment trusts  there can be no assurance that our basis for computing ffo is comparable with that of other real estate investment trusts 
for the years ended december   and  our ffo is calculated as follows amounts in thousands net income    adjustments real estate depreciation  net of minority interest  real estate depreciation related to unconsolidated entities  loss gain on dispositions of real estate   distributions to minority partners in excess of income  amortization of intangibles    income tax arising from disposals  gain on disposition of land  discontinued operations real estate depreciation  net of minority interest   loss on disposals  net of minority interest  distributions to minority partners in excess of income  income tax arising from disposals  other items deferred income tax benefit interest expense on mandatorily redeemable convertible preferred securities    preferred stock dividends and distributions   minority interest in aimco operating partnership   diluted funds from operations available to common shares  and equivalents weighted average number of common shares and equivalents common shares and equivalents    preferred stock  preferred op units  and other securities convertible into common shares    common op units and equivalents    cash flow provided by operating activities   cash flow used in investing activities   cash flow provided by used in financing activities  contribution to free cash flow we look at our free cash flow as a means of monitoring the operations of the components of our business 
in this regard  in addition to the year to year comparative discussion  we have provided disclosure see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report on the contribution separated between consolidated and unconsolidated activity to our free cash flow from several components of our business  and a reconciliation of free cash flow to ffo  less capital replacements and capital enhancements  and to net income for the years ended december   and we define free cash flow as ffo  less capital replacements and capital enhancements  plus interest expense and preferred stock dividends

liquidity and capital resources liquidity is the ability to meet present and future financial obligations either through the sale or maturity of existing assets or by the acquisition of additional funds through working capital management 
both the coordination of asset and liability maturities and effective working capital management are important to the maintenance of liquidity 
our primary source of liquidity is our cash flow from operations as determined by rental rates  occupancy levels and operating expenses related to our portfolio of apartment properties  as well as cash flow from operations generated by our investment management business 
our principal demands for liquidity include normal operating activities  payments of principal and interest on outstanding debt  capital expenditures  acquisitions of and investments in properties  dividends paid to stockholders and distributions paid to limited partners 
we consider our cash provided by operating activities to be adequate to meet short term liquidity demands 
in the event that there continues to be an economic downturn or the national economy continues to deteriorate and the cash provided by operating activities is no longer adequate  we have additional means  such as short term borrowing availability  to help us meet our short term liquidity demands 
we use our revolving credit facility for general corporate purposes and to fund investments on an interim basis 
we expect to meet our long term liquidity requirements  such as debt maturities and property acquisitions  through long term borrowings  both secured and unsecured  the issuance of debt or equity securities including op units  the sale of properties and cash generated from operations 
at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  an increase of million from december  in addition  we had million of restricted cash million of which was acquired in the casden merger  primarily consisting of reserves and impounds held by lenders for bond sinking funds  capital expenditures  property taxes and insurance 
in addition  cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash are held by partnerships that are not presented on a consolidated basis 
the following discussion relates to changes in cash due to operating  investing and financing activities  which are presented in our consolidated statements of cash flows in item of this annual report 
operating activities for the year ended december   our net cash provided by operating activities was million  compared to million for the year ended december  this decline is due primarily to the economic downturn in the national economy and the related deterioration in our operating activities  as well as an increase in our level of operating assets  partially offset by a decrease in our operating liabilities 
investing activities for the year ended december   our net cash used in investing activities was million compared to million for the year ended december  in our investing activities related to investments in acquisitions and our existing real estate assets through capital expenditures and redevelopment  as well as dispositions of apartment properties 
see further discussion on capital expenditures under the heading capital expenditures 
our acquisitions included the casden merger and the new england properties acquisition 
in addition  we acquired the villas at park la brea and made various acquisitions of limited partnership interests held by third party investors in certain partnerships for which we act as the general partner 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in this annual report for further discussion on these activities 
although we hold all of our properties for investment  we sell properties when they do not meet our investment criteria or are located in areas that we believe do not justify our continued investment  in both cases as compared to alternative uses for our capital 
the table below shows our dispositions during the year ended december  property type number of properties gross proceeds existing debt transaction costs net proceeds our share of net proceeds in millions in millions in millions in millions conventional commercial affordable senior living total we are currently marketing for sale certain real estate properties that are inconsistent with our long term investment strategies as determined by management from time to time 
proceeds from dispositions are expected to be at levels above that of  and are planned to be used to reduce debt and fund capital and other operating needs 
financing activities for the year ended december   net cash provided by financing activities was million compared to net cash used in financing activities of million for the year ended december  in our financing activities related to mortgage financing  short term debt financing  issuance of common and preferred equity  payment of our dividends and payment of our principal debt amortization 
during the year ended december   we refinanced or closed mortgage loans generating  million of total proceeds at a weighted average interest rate of  of which approximately million related to consolidated properties these mortgages do not include the million in mortgage loans related to the new england properties acquisition that are discussed below 
each loan is non recourse 
among the loans  are individually secured by one of properties with no cross collateralization  and loans totaling million are cross collateralized with certain other mortgage loans 
after repayment of existing debt and payment of transaction costs totaling million  our share of the total million in net proceeds was million which was used to repay existing short term debt and for other corporate purposes 
further details on these mortgage loans are shown in the table below mortgage type loan amount term rate in millions conventional fixed rate up to yr  yr amortization conventional fixed rate up to yr  yr amortization conventional variable rate yr revolving facility tax exempt variable rate yrs affordable fixed rate yrs  fully amortizing in connection with the casden merger  we assumed million of primarily long term  fixed rate  fully amortizing notes payable with a weighted average interest rate of 
each of the notes is individually secured by one of properties with no cross collateralization 
in connection with the new england properties acquisition  we closed mortgage loans generating million of long term  fixed rate  fully amortizing notes with a weighted average interest rate of 
each loan is non recourse and is individually secured by one of the properties  with no cross collateralization 
in connection with our purchase of the villas at park la brea  we closed a million  long term  fixed rate  fully amortizing note with an interest rate of 
this note is non recourse and secured by the property 
as of december   substantially all of the company s owned or controlled properties and of our total assets were encumbered by or served as collateral for debt 
as of december   we had total secured outstanding indebtedness of  million  comprised of  million of secured long term financing   million of secured tax exempt long term bond financing and million in secured short term financing 
as of december   approximately of our indebtedness bears interest at variable rates  of which million  or  is tax exempt bond financing 
as of december   we had a total of mortgage loans  with an aggregate principal balance outstanding of million  that were cross collateralized with certain other mortgage loans 
other than these loans  none of our debt is subject to cross collateralization provisions 
the weighted average interest rate on our long term secured notes payable and tax exempt bonds was  with a weighted average maturity of years as of december  in we issued the following equity million shares of common stock  valued at million  in connection with the casden merger million shares of class r preferred stock  par value per share  in two registered public offerings  with total net proceeds of approximately million used to repay short term indebtedness million shares of common stock in a registered public offering at a net price of per share 
the total net proceeds of approximately million were used to repay outstanding indebtedness on our revolving credit facility and a portion of the casden loan 
our board of directors has  from time to time  authorized us to repurchase shares of common stock and our preferred stock 
currently  we are authorized to repurchase up to a total of approximately million shares  of which up to million shares may be common stock and up to million shares may be preferred stock 
while we have no current plans to repurchase common stock or our preferred stock  these repurchases may be made from time to time in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions  subject to applicable law 
during the year ended december   we repurchased no shares of common stock or preferred stock 
it is the present policy of our board of directors to increase the dividend annually in an amount equal to one half of the projected increase in affo subject to minimum distribution requirements to maintain our reit status 
our board of directors considers the discretionary nature of capital enhancement spending in its consideration of affo as it relates to our dividend policy 
the dividend paid in february of per share  which was the same dividend amount as was paid in each quarter of  represents a distribution of of affo before deducting capital enhancements and of ffo for the quarter ended december  we continue to monitor the dividend as a percentage of affo before deducting capital enhancements 
if the payout were to exceed for a sustained period  our board of directors would consider a change in the dividend to match our operating profitability 
on november   aimco and the aimco operating partnership filed a shelf registration statement with the securities and exchange commission  or sec  with respect to an aggregate of million of debt and equity securities of aimco and million of debt securities of the aimco operating partnership  all of which was carried forward from aimco s shelf registration statement 
the sec declared the registration statement effective on november  as of december   we had approximately million of debt and equity available and the aimco operating partnership had million of debt available from this registration statement 
we expect to finance acquisitions of real estate interests with the issuance of equity and debt securities under the shelf registration statement as well as with cash from operations or short term borrowings 
credit facility and term loan on february   we and our lenders amended our revolving credit facility to increase the available commitment  at our option  to million such commitment in excess of million is not available until it has been syndicated  reduce the minimum fixed charge coverage ratio from to through the maturity date and extend the maturity date one year to july  upon the effective date of the amendment  the margin on libor based loans and base rate loans was amended to a range between to and 
to  respectively  based on the fixed charge coverage ratio 
in addition  we and our lenders amended the casden loan with the same reduction in the fixed charge coverage ratio as stated above for the credit facility  through maturity  and to eliminate mandatory prepayments for the remainder of the term using proceeds from equity  sales or refinancing proceeds except as such proceeds arise from transactions of the properties acquired in the casden merger 
the financial covenants contained in the amended and restated revolving credit facility and the casden loan require us to maintain a ratio of debt to gross asset value of no more than to  and an interest coverage ratio of to in addition  the amended and restated revolving credit facility and the casden loan limit us from distributing more than of our funds from operations over any month period or such amounts as may be necessary for us to maintain our status as a reit 
finally  the fixed charge coverage ratio requirement for the quarter ended june  through february  at which time the coverage ratios were further amended as indicated above was as of december   we were in compliance with all financial covenant requirements 
future capital needs we expect to fund any future acquisitions  redevelopment and capital improvements principally with proceeds from property sales  short term borrowings and operating cash flows 
as of december   we had properties with  units under redevelopment having an estimated total investment fair market value prior to redevelopment plus new redevelopment spending of million  of which approximately million remains to be spent 
our share of the estimated total investment is million of which approximately million remains to be spent 
during  we have million of scheduled maturities of property debt that we expect to refinance  million of scheduled principal amortization payments on property debt that we expect to pay with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales  and million of short term debt million on the credit facility and million on the casden loan that we expect to repay a portion of with operating cash flows and proceeds from property sales 
capital expenditures for the year ended december   we spent a total of million and million on capital replacements expenditures required to maintain the related asset and on capital enhancements expenditures that add a new feature or revenue source at a property  respectively 
capital replacements spending has increased for two primary reasons a general increase in spending to maintain our assets  and an increase in capitalized costs 
in addition to capital replacements  we monitor capital enhancements  which we distinguish from capital replacements 
capital enhancements are costs incurred to add additional rental square footage  a new building or a new revenue producing feature 
for example  replacement of existing kitchen appliances is a capital replacement  however  if the same replacements are done in connection with an extensive remodeling project then they are characterized as a capital enhancement 
because the distinction between capital replacements and capital enhancements is not consistently applied across reits and because there is a risk of partial substitution between capital replacements and capital enhancements  we monitor and report both capital replacements and capital enhancements and deduct both in our calculation of affo 
the table below details our actual spending on capital replacements and capital enhancements based on a per unit and total dollar basis based on approximately  units for the year ended december  and reconciles it to our consolidated statement of cash flows useful life in yrs capital replacements actual cost per unit capital enhancements actual cost per unit total cr ce annual cost per unit capital replacements actual cost capital enhancements actual cost total cr ce annual cost in thousands in thousands in thousands carpets   flooring   appliances   blinds shades furnace air   hot water heaters   kitchen bath   exterior painting   landscaping   pool exercise facilities   computers  miscellaneous   roofs   parking lot   building electrical  elevator  plumbing submetering   capitalized payroll   total company s share   plus minority partners share of consolidated spending less our share of unconsolidated spending   total spending per consolidated statement of cash flows   in addition  we capitalized approximately million of our share of indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended december   increasing our share of capital replacement million and capital enhancement million spending to million 
we funded these expenditures with cash provided by operating activities  working capital reserves  and borrowings under our credit facility 
for the year ended december   we spent a total of million for initial capital expenditures  or ice  expenditures at a property that have been identified  at the time the property is acquired  as expenditures to be incurred within one year of the acquisition  which in this period relates primarily to the properties acquired in the casden merger and redevelopment expenditures that substantially upgrade the property 
the following table reconciles our share of those expenditures to our consolidated statement of cash flows in millions year ended december  ice redevelopment total conventional assets affordable assets total company s share plus minority partners share of consolidated spending less our share of unconsolidated spending total ice and redevelopment spending per consolidated statement of cash flows in addition  we capitalized approximately million of our share of direct and indirect costs related to these activities for the year ended december   increasing our share of ice and redevelopment spending to million 
we funded these expenditures with cash provided by operating activities  working capital reserves  and borrowings under our credit facility 
during and  we refined our process for identifying and capitalizing certain indirect costs  which include the implementation of a detailed time reporting system to measure such activities more accurately 
as a result of the refined process  we capitalized approximately million of our share of indirect costs for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the year ended december   for a reduction of approximately million 
off balance sheet arrangements we own general and limited partner interests in unconsolidated real estate partnerships  which interests were acquired through acquisitions  direct purchases and separate offers to other limited partners 
our total ownership interests in these unconsolidated real estate partnerships range from to 
however  based on the provisions of the related partnership agreements  which grant varying degrees of control  we are not deemed to have control of these partnerships sufficient to require or permit consolidation for accounting purposes 
there are no lines of credit  side agreements  financial guarantees  or any other derivative financial instruments related to or between us and our unconsolidated real estate partnerships 
accordingly  our maximum risk of loss related to these unconsolidated real estate partnerships is limited to the aggregate carrying amount of our investment in the unconsolidated real estate partnerships and any outstanding notes receivable as reported in our consolidated financial statements 
see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for additional information on our unconsolidated real estate partnerships

we agreed to pay million per quarter for five years up to an aggregate amount of million to casden development company  llc as a retainer on account for redevelopment services 
additionally  we have committed to invest up to million for a limited liability company interest in casden properties  llc  a newly formed company controlled by third parties 
as of december   we had invested million see note to the consolidated financial statements in item of this annual report for additional information 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our primary market risk exposure relates to changes in interest rates 
we are not subject to any foreign currency exchange rate risk or commodity price risk  or any other material market rate or price risks 
we use predominantly long term  fixed rate and self amortizing non recourse mortgage debt in order to avoid the refunding and repricing risks of short term borrowings 
we use short term debt financing and working capital primarily to fund short term uses and acquisitions and generally expect to refinance such borrowings with cash from operating activities  property sales proceeds or long term debt financings 
we had  million of variable rate debt outstanding at december   which represented of our total outstanding debt 
of the total variable debt  the major components were floating rate tax exempt bond financing million  floating rate secured notes million  the casden loan million  and the credit facility million 
based on this level of debt  an increase in interest rates of would result in our income and cash flows being reduced by million on an annual basis 
historically  changes in tax exempt interest rates have been at a ratio less than with changes in taxable interest rates 
variable rate tax exempt bond financing is benchmarked against the bond market association municipal swap index the bma index 
since  the bma index has averaged of the year treasury yield 
if this relationship continues and based on our level of tax exempt debt  an increase of in taxable interest rates would result in our income and cash flows being reduced by million on an annual basis 
at december   the company had  million of fixed rate debt outstanding 
as of december   based on our level of variable debt of million  an increase in interest rates of would have resulted in our income and cash flows being reduced by million on an annual basis 
the year ended december  had an increased potential reduction of million as compared to the year ended december  due to our increased variable debt balance in  as a result of our acquisitions and newly consolidated properties 
as of december   the scheduled principal amortization and maturity payments for our consolidated secured notes payable and consolidated secured tax exempt bonds were as follows dollars in thousands amortization maturities total percentage thereafter  the estimated aggregate fair value of our cash and cash equivalents  receivables  payables and short term secured debt as of december  approximate their carrying value due to their relatively short term nature 
management further believes that the fair value of our variable rate secured tax exempt bond debt and variable rate secured long term debt approximate their carrying values 
the fair value for our fixed rate debt agreements were estimated based on the quoted market rate for the same or similar issues 
the carrying amount of our fixed rate debt at december  was billion compared to the computed fair value of billion see note to the consolidated financial statements in
