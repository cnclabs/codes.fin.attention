item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations general the financial statements and data presented herein have been prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap unless otherwise noted 
gaap differs from statutory accounting practices used by regulatory authorities in their oversight responsibilities of insurance companies 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for a reconciliation of our net income and equity between gaap and statutory accounting bases 
critical accounting policies following is a discussion of key financial concepts and of those accounting policies which we believe to be the most critical 
that is  these are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results of operations and they require management s most complex judgments  including the need to make estimates about the effect of insurance losses and other matters that are inherently uncertain 
premium income 
gross premiums written represent the amounts billed to policyholders 
gross premiums written are reduced by premiums ceded to reinsurers and renewal credits in determining net premiums written 
premiums ceded to reinsurers represent the cost to us of reducing our exposure to medical professional liability losses by transferring agreed upon insurance risks to reinsurers through a reinsurance contract or treaty 
renewal credits are reductions in premium billings to renewing policyholders 
net premiums written are adjusted by any amount which has been billed but not yet earned during the period in arriving at earned premiums 
for several large groups of policyholders  we have insurance programs where the premiums are retrospectively determined based on losses during the period 
under all of the current programs  the full premium level is determined and billed at the inception of the policy term 
the premium level could potentially be reduced and a premium refund made if the program loss experience is favorable 
premiums billed under retrospective programs are recorded as premiums written  while premium refunds accrued under retrospective programs are recorded as unearned premiums 
under retrospective programs  premiums earned are premiums written reduced by premium refunds accrued 
premium refunds are accrued to reflect the risk sharing program results on a basis consistent with the underlying loss experience 
the program loss experience is that which is included in the determination of our losses and loss adjustment expenses lae 
as described more fully below  one component of the expense for losses and lae is the estimate of future payments for claims and related expenses of adjudicating claims 
unearned premiums represent premiums billed but not yet fully earned at the end of the reporting period 
premiums receivable represent annual billed and unbilled premiums which have not yet been collected 
reserves for losses and loss adjustment expenses 
we write one line of business  medical professional liability 
losses and lae reserves are estimates of future payments for reported claims and related expenses of adjudicating claims with respect to insured events that have occurred in the past 
the change in these reserves from year to year is reflected as an increase or decrease to our losses and lae 
medical professional liability losses and lae reserves are established based on an estimate of these future payments as reflected in our past experience with similar cases and historical trends involving claim payment patterns 
other factors that modify past experience are also considered in setting reserves  including court decisions  economic conditions  current trends in losses  and inflation 
reserving for medical professional liability claims is a complex and uncertain process  requiring the use of informed estimates and judgments 
although we intend to estimate conservatively our future payments relating to losses incurred  there can be no assurance that currently established reserves will prove adequate in light of subsequent actual experience 
the estimation process is an extensive effort 
it begins in our claims department with the initial report of a claim 
for each claim reported  a case reserve is established by the claims department based on analysis of the facts of the particular case and the judgment of claims management 
this estimation process is not by formula but is driven by the investigation of facts combined with the experience and insight of claims management applied to each individual case 
the timing of establishing case reserves follows established protocols based on the underlying facts and circumstances on a case by case basis 
specific factors considered include the claimants assertion of loss  the amount of documented damages asserted  an expert medical assessment  the jurisdiction where the incident occurred  our experience with any similar cases in the past  as well as any other factors pertinent to the specific case 
each quarter  the aggregate of case reserves by report year is compiled and subjected to extensive analysis 
semiannually  our independent actuary performs an actuarial valuation of reserves based on the data comprising our detailed claims experience since inception 
the actuarial valuation entails application of various statistically based actuarial formulae  an analysis of trends  and a series of judgments to produce an aggregate estimate of our liability at the balance sheet date 
specific factors included in the estimation process include the level of case reserves by jurisdiction by report year  the change in case reserves between each evaluation date  historical trends in the development of our initial case reserves to final conclusion  expected losses and lae levels based on past experience relative to the level of premium earned  reinsurance treaty terms  and any other pertinent factors that may arise 
in consultation with our independent actuary  we utilize several methods in order to estimate losses and lae reserves by projecting ultimate losses 
by utilizing and comparing the results of these methods  we are better able to analyze loss data and establish an appropriate reserve 
our independent actuary provides a point estimate for loss reserves rather than a range 
the actuarial valuation of reserves is a critical component of the financial reporting process and provides the foundation for the determination of reserve levels 
in addition to reporting under gaap  we file financial statements with state regulatory authorities based on statutory accounting requirements 
these requirements include a certification of reserves by an appointed actuary 
the reserves in our statutory filings have been certified by an independent medical professional liability insurance actuary 
our ultimate liability will be known after all claims are closed  which is likely to be several years into the future 
for example  as of december   the oldest report date of an open claim is incurred losses for each report year will develop with a change in estimate in each subsequent calendar year until all claims are closed for that report year 
loss development could potentially have a significant impact on our results of operations 
developments changing the ultimate liability as little as could have a material impact on our reported operating results 
the inherent uncertainty in establishing reserves is relatively greater for companies writing long tail medical professional liability business 
each claim reported has the potential to be significant in amount 
for the three year period ended december   the average indemnity payment per paid claim was  with total indemnity payments of million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the cost of individual indemnity payments over this three year period ranged from  to million 
due to the extended nature of the claim resolution process and the wide range of potential outcomes of professional liability claims  established reserve estimates may be adversely impacted by judicial expansion of liability standards  unfavorable legislative actions  expansive interpretations of contracts  inflation associated with medical claims  lack of a legislated cap on non economic damages  and the propensity of individuals to file claims 
these risk factors are amplified given the increase in new business written in new markets because there is limited historical data available which can be used to estimate current loss levels 
we refine reserve estimates as experience develops and additional claims are reported or existing claims are closed  adjustments to losses reserved in prior periods are reflected in the results of the periods in which the adjustments are made 
losses and lae reserve liabilities as stated on the balance sheet are reported gross before recovery from reinsurers for the portion of the claims covered under the reinsurance program 
losses and lae expenses as stated on the income statement are reported net of reinsurance recoveries 
reinsurance 
we manage our exposure to individual claim losses  annual aggregate losses  and lae through our reinsurance program 
reinsurance is a customary practice in the industry 
it allows us to obtain indemnification against a specified portion of losses associated with insurance policies we have underwritten by entering into a reinsurance agreement with other insurance enterprises or reinsurers 
we pay or cede part of our policyholder premium to reinsurers 
the reinsurers in return agree to reimburse us for a specified portion of any claims covered under the reinsurance contract 
while reinsurance arrangements are designed to limit losses from large exposures and to permit recovery of a portion of direct losses  reinsurance does not relieve us of liability to our insureds 
under our current primary reinsurance contract  the premium ceded to the reinsurers is based on a fixed rate applied to policy premium for that coverage layer 
during the year  estimated payments are made to the reinsurers  and a final adjustment is made at the end of the year to reflect actual premium earned in accordance with the treaty 
for the years through  we retained risk exposure up to  for each and every claim 
beginning january   the retention level has been increased to  for each and every claim 
for and prior years  in accordance with one of our primary reinsurance contracts  the portion of the policyholder premium ceded to the reinsurers was swing rated or experience rated on a retrospective basis 
this swing rated cession program is subject to a minimum and maximum premium range to be paid to the reinsurers in the future  depending upon the extent of losses actually paid by the reinsurers 
a deposit premium is paid by us during the initial policy year 
an additional liability  retrospective premiums accrued under reinsurance treaties is recorded by us to represent an estimate of net additional payments to be made to the reinsurers under the program  based on the level of loss and lae reserves recorded 
like loss and lae reserves  adjustments to prior year ceded premiums payable to the reinsurers are reflected in the results of the periods in which the adjustments are made 
the swing rated reinsurance premiums are estimated in a manner consistent with the estimation of our loss reserves  and therefore contain uncertainties like those inherent in the loss reserve estimate 
our practice for accounting for the liability for retrospective premiums accrued under reinsurance treaties was to record the current year swing rated reinsurance premium at management s best estimate of the ultimate liability  which was generally the maximum rate payable under terms of the treaty 
due to the long tail nature of the medical professional liability insurance business  it takes several years for the losses for any given report year to fully develop 
since the ultimate liability for reinsurance premiums depends on the ultimate losses  among other things  it is several years after the initial reinsurance premium accrual before the amount becomes known 
during the intervening periods  reevaluations are made and adjustments to the accrued retrospective premiums are made as considered appropriate by management 
exposure to individual losses in excess of million is known as excess layer coverage 
excess layer premiums are recorded as current year reinsurance ceded costs 
under the excess layer treaties  prior to we ceded to our reinsurers over of our exposure 
effective since january   we cede of our risks and premiums related to these coverage layers 
investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is composed principally of fixed maturity securities classified as available for sale 
all securities with gross unrealized losses at the balance sheet date are evaluated for evidence of other than temporary impairment  on a quarterly basis 
we write down to fair value any security with an impairment that is deemed to be other than temporary in the period the determination is made 
the assessment of whether such impairment has occurred is based on management s case by case evaluation of the underlying reasons for the decline in fair value 
management considers a wide range of factors and uses its best judgment in evaluating the cause of the decline in the estimated fair value of the security and in assessing the prospects for near term recovery 
factors considered in the evaluation include but are not limited to interest rates  market related factors other than interest rates  and financial conditions  business prospects and other fundamental factors specific to the securities issuer 
declines attributable to issuer fundamentals are reviewed in further detail 
we have a security monitoring process which includes quarterly review by an investment committee comprised of members of our board of directors and representatives of policyholders 
our ceo and cfo also participate in the committee meetings in which our professional investment advisors review with the committee and management the analysis prepared by our investment manager of each security that has certain characteristics including  but not limited to deterioration of the financial condition of the issuer  the magnitude and duration of unrealized losses  and the credit rating and industry of the issuer 
the primary factors considered in evaluating whether a decline in value is other than temporary include the length of time and the extent to which the fair value has been less than cost  the financial condition and near term prospects of the issuer  whether the issuer is current on contractually obligated interest and principal payments  and our intent and ability to retain the investment for a period of time sufficient to allow for any anticipated recovery 
the evaluation for other than temporary impairments is a quantitative and qualitative process involving judgments which is subject to risks and uncertainties 
the risks and uncertainties include changes in general economic conditions  the issuer s financial condition and the effects of changes in interest rates 
goodwill 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas 
sfas changes the accounting for goodwill from an amortization method to an impairment only approach 
amortization of goodwill ceased upon adoption of sfas on january  our goodwill asset  million as of december   resulted from the acquisition of three businesses which now operate as divisions of the practice management services segment 
we completed our initial goodwill impairment testing under sfas and concluded that the goodwill asset was not impaired as of the date of implementation of sfas  nor was it impaired as of december  the basic steps involved in the goodwill impairment test are identification of the reporting unit to be tested  and calculation of the current fair value of the reporting unit and comparing it to the carrying value 
if the current fair value of the reporting unit exceeds the carrying value  goodwill is not impaired 
because the acquired divisions are not publicly traded  a discounted cash value calculation is used to determine the current fair value of the unit 
estimates as to future performance of the divisions along with current market value indicators provide the basis for determination of the current fair value of the unit 
there is no guarantee of either the accuracy of the estimate of future performance of the divisions or of the accuracy of current market value indicators  since the real test of market value is what a potential acquirer is willing to pay 
recent industry performance our results of operations have historically been influenced by factors affecting the medical professional liability industry in general 
the operating results of the us medical professional liability industry have been subject to significant variations over time due to competition  general economic conditions  judicial trends and fluctuations in interest rates 
we actively monitor industry trends and consider them in relation to our circumstances when setting rates or establishing reserves 
according to the january best s review  published by am best company  inc am best  in  physicians across the country were faced with higher medical professional liability insurance premiums and fewer companies offering the coverage 
the escalation in premium rates in recent years is a reflection of rising frequency and severity of claims at a time when premium rates were depressed thereby exacerbating insurers poor operating performance 
the medical professional liability insurance marketplace is adjusting to the departure of the st 
paul companies  the largest medical professional liability insurer at that time  from the sector  while other companies have scaled back their market share or left some states entirely 
of the states identified by am best as having a crisis in medical care stemming from the lack of availability of medical professional liability insurance  only one west virginia falls into our market territory 
two of our other market jurisdictions  virginia and delaware  have been significantly impacted by the changes in market profile described by best s review 
in the january issue of best s review  am best predicted trends to include sustained price increases and worsening claims severity 
the realization of this prediction throughout and ultimately resulted in the change in the entire medical professional liability insurance market as a number of the insurance providers experienced adverse financial results and subsequently withdrew from the market 
medical professional liability lawsuits have been identified as a key factor in the rising cost of the us tort system according to an article in the february   issue of bestweek  a publication of am best 
the article further states that since  medical professional liability tort costs rose an average of a year  outpacing the average overall growth in tort costs of over the same period 
the february  issue of best s review reports that between and  median professional liability jury awards increased  causing a rise in medical professional liability insurance rates 
several of the jurisdictions in which we operate have not adopted tort reform  most notably the district of columbia which had the highest cumulative mean medical professional liability indemnity payment level for the ten year period ending december   according to the latest data available from the national practitioner data bank 
consolidated net income years ended december   and year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income totaled  for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  year to date results were negatively impacted by the increase in allowance for uncollectible premium receivable and unfavorable development of losses on claims reported in prior years 
net realized investment losses  after tax  for the year ended december  totaled  compared to net realized investment losses of  for the year ended december  the operating results of our insurance segment for the year ended december  were primarily driven by the following factors 
we continued to experience a significant increase in new business written in for the year  new business written excluding the ceded hca program was million  up million or  from million for the rise in new business written coupled with the increased premium rates resulted in a increase in net premiums earned 
the strain on current period earnings as a result of the large increase in new business written  combined with investment yield declines  resulted in pressure on short term profitability 
while the cost for claims reported in increased due to the rise in exposure  the development of losses for claims originally reported in and reduced pre tax earnings for our practice management segment earnings in decreased compared to primarily as a result of a decrease in client revenue combined with an increase in expenses 
client revenue decreases stem from a reduction in non recurring consulting assignments  as medical practice income comes under increasing pressure due to reductions in the payer system  physicians have less discretionary funds available for consultant engagements 
expense decreases are due to the cessation of goodwill amortization due to the implementation of sfas beginning january   offset by expenses associated with the transition of client service for two of the former owners as they moved towards the expiration of their employment contracts at the end of and other transitional costs associated with the continued integration of the purchased companies 
three months ended december  compared to three months ended december  net income for the fourth quarter of was  compared to a net loss of  in the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter result includes realized investment gains  net of tax  of  compared to realized investment losses  net of tax  of  in the fourth quarter of the pre tax operating result for the insurance segment was income of  in compared to  in  respectively 
for the practice management services segment  the fourth quarter result for was pre tax income of  compared to a pre tax loss of  for the fourth quarter of year ended december  compared to year ended december  net income totaled million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  excluding net realized investment losses  operating earnings for the year were million compared to million for the year total revenue in increased over the level 
the higher revenue was offset by an increase in loss and loss adjustment expenses  in underwriting expenses  and in practice management expenses 
our insurance segment experienced a substantial increase in new business written in the year ended december   which resulted in a rise in net premiums earned 
the profitability of a medical professional liability insurance policy is designed to emerge over a period of years rather than in the year the policy is written  profits are designed to accrue through investment income on the invested premiums and through successful resolution of claims 
therefore  the large increase in new business written in the current period causes a strain on current period earnings 
in addition  earnings were impacted by reduced net investment income because of lower market yields and by increased incurred losses reflecting increased frequency and severity trends 
our practice management segment produced a significant increase in revenue primarily as a result of its focused efforts on new business development 
higher revenue was offset by expenses related to the ongoing servicing of new business  the allocation of additional resources to new business development and additional expenses associated with the execution of the contingent purchase payouts 
similar to the insurance segment  in the start up of new client relationships  we incur costs not covered by initial client revenue  the design of the revenue stream is to recover the initial costs through the on going client relationship 
three months ended december  compared to three months ended december  results for the fourth quarter of were a net loss of  compared to net income of  in the fourth quarter of the fourth quarter result includes net realized investment losses  net of tax  of  the insurance segment experienced a significant increase in new business written  with the associated impact on net earnings as described above  producing pre tax earnings of  before realized investment losses  compared to fourth quarter pre tax earnings of million 
practice management segment revenues increased in the fourth quarter of over  the segment produced quarterly pre tax results of a loss of  compared to pre tax earnings of  in the fourth quarter of net premiums earned the following table is a summary of our net premiums earned year ended december  in thousands gross premiums written    change in unearned premiums    gross premiums earned before renewal credits    reinsurance premiums ceded related to current year    prior years   total reinsurance premiums ceded    net premiums earned before renewal credits    renewal credits  net premiums earned    year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross premiums written increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to net new business written combined with the premium rate increases  which averaged 
the gross premiums written include premiums for retrospectively rated programs of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  written premium in included million for the billing of previously accrued premium for one of the retrospectively rated risk sharing programs discussed in the premium collection litigation section below 
gross premiums written on excess layer coverage increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the change in unearned premiums for the period increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from net new business written throughout the year combined with premium rate increases 
gross premiums earned before renewal credits increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to million of additional premiums earned under basic medical professional liability insurance and million of additional gross premiums earned for excess limits coverage 
reinsurance premiums ceded increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the increase in gross premiums earned 
reinsurance premiums are affected by current year premiums payable to the reinsurers  as well as the retrospective adjustments to accruals for prior year premiums 
current year reinsurance premiums ceded increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase was due to the increased gross premium reinsured  including an increase of for excess limit coverage which was ceded to unaffiliated reinsurers 
the reinsurance premium rates in were unchanged from the level 
reinsurance premiums related to prior years under the swing rated treaty were reduced by million in and million in due to favorable loss development of reinsured losses compared to our prior estimates 
generally  losses covered by the swing rated treaty are in the range excess of  to million 
loss development results from the re estimation and settlement of individual losses 
the change is primarily reflective of the favorable loss development in the  and coverage years 
the change is primarily reflective of the favorable loss development in the and coverage years 
as claims are brought to conclusion  each year there are fewer outstanding claims in the years covered by this reinsurance treaty 
the potential for loss development impacting this reinsurance coverage is reduced each year as the inventory of open claims is reduced 
while loss development on an aggregate basis has been favorable  there is no guarantee that development for the remainder of the unresolved claims will follow the same pattern 
the liability retrospective premiums accrued under reinsurance treaties decreased to million at december  from million at december  renewal credits for the year ended december   reflect our decision to not provide a renewal premium credit for renewals 
net premiums earned increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase reflects the million growth in gross earned premiums and the lower renewal credits partially offset by the million higher reinsurance premiums in compared to in we initiated a program to provide insurance coverage to physicians at four hca hospitals in west virginia 
under this arrangement  we cede of the insurance exposure to a captive insurance company affiliated with the sponsoring hospitals 
we receive a ceding commission for providing complete policy underwriting  claims and administrative services for these policies 
while accounting standards require the premium written to be included as a part of our direct written premium  we have no net written nor net earned premium from this program 
american captive corporation acc  our subsidiary  developed its first protected cell captive  the princeton community hospital cell west virginia  in in anticipation of the initiation of the princeton cell within acc  some insurance was underwritten by us during the first nine months of for policies that will be reinsured by the princeton cell when it becomes active 
the premium amounts for these policies are separately identified in the following table to aid comparisons 
the mix of business produced directly by us versus by agents has changed between years as shown on the following chart of new gross written premium year ended december  in thousands direct   agent   hca princeton cell the distribution of premium written shows notable growth in our market areas outside of the district of columbia

during  it was determined that one of our hospital sponsored retrospective programs would not be renewed 
this is the only retrospective program in which the full policy premium was not billed at the beginning of the policy period 
rather  and in accordance with the terms of the contract  in we billed the hospital sponsor million  and an additional  was billed during based on the actual accumulated loss experience of the terminated program 
as a result of the amount billed in  written premium for the year increased by a net amount of  over the same period in while net earned premium was unaffected by the billing 
because the original bill was not paid when due  we initiated legal proceedings to collect 
we have filed a motion for summary judgment  which has not yet been decided 
the hospital sponsor stopped admitting patients in may and sold its principal assets during the third quarter of although we continue to pursue the claim  based on information received during the third quarter of and consultation with legal counsel  it appears that the hospital assets may not be sufficient to cover its liabilities  including our claim 
accordingly  we increased our allowance for uncollectibility by million to cover of the amount receivable 
the charge for the allowance is included in underwriting expense 
since the amount due to us is significant  we will continue to pursue collection of the amount due 
legal fees incurred through the year ended december  for this action were approximately  higher than in year ended december  compared to year ended december  gross premiums written increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  due to net new business written combined with the premium rate increases  which averaged 
the gross premiums written include premiums for retrospectively rated programs of million for the year ended december  and million for the year ended december  written premium in included million for the billing of previously accrued premium for one of the retrospectively rated risk sharing programs further discussed below 
gross premiums written on excess layer coverage increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  during  it was determined that one of our retrospective programs would not be renewed at the september  renewal date 
under this type of risk sharing program  physicians are underwritten directly by us and pay lower individual premiums than if not part of the risk sharing program 
at the end of the policy year covered by the premium  a review of the actual loss experience of the physician group is completed 
should the group s loss experience be unfavorable  we will require additional premium payments from the sponsoring hospital to offset the unfavorable losses 
under terms of the contract based on the actual accumulated loss experience of the terminated program  we billed the hospital sponsor million in and an additional  in january based on the continuing development of loss experience  during the year ended december    of gross premium earned has been accrued related to additional amounts due to us from the hospital sponsor 
because the september bill was not paid when due  we initiated legal proceedings to collect 
we will use all means legally available to collect the amount due 
although we believe that we will prevail  since the premium amount is disputed  an allowance for uncollectibility has been established and is included in underwriting expenses 
pursuit of this litigation requires an expense for legal fees  which is reported as an underwriting expense  and reduces our net earnings 
the change in unearned premiums for the period increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase resulted from net new business written throughout the year 
gross premiums earned before renewal credits increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily due to million of additional premiums earned under basic medical professional liability insurance and million of additional gross premiums earned for excess limits coverage 
reinsurance premiums ceded increased by million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase was primarily the result of the increase in gross premiums earned 
reinsurance premiums are affected by current year premiums payable to the reinsurers  as well as the retrospective adjustments to accruals for prior year premiums 
current year reinsurance premiums ceded increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  this increase is due to the increased gross premium reinsured 
the reinsurance premium rates in were unchanged from the level 
reinsurance premiums related to prior years under the swing rated treaty were reduced by million in and million in due to favorable loss development of reinsured losses compared to prior estimates by us

the liability retrospective premiums accrued under reinsurance treaties decreased to million at december  from million at december  renewal credits decreased to  for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   reflecting our decision to not provide a renewal premium credit for renewals 
in general  renewal credits apply to policies written in the district of columbia 
a growing proportion of our business is written in other jurisdictions where renewal credits are not issued 
net premiums earned before renewal credits increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  net premiums earned after renewal credits increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase reflects the million growth in gross earned premiums and the lower renewal credits  partially offset by the million higher reinsurance premiums in compared to the mix of business produced directly by us versus by agents has changed between years as shown on the following chart of new gross written premium

additionally  in  we determined that an equity security consisting of common stock experienced an other than temporary impairment 
accordingly  we recorded a pre tax impairment loss of  in relating to that investment 
for securities sold during at a loss  the following is a summary of facts and circumstances related to the securities five securities  all corporate fixed maturities  were sold for consideration totaling million resulting in realized pre tax losses totaling million 
in  prior to the sale  these securities experienced a decline in fair value of million from december  three additional securities  all corporate fixed maturities  were sold for consideration totaling million  resulting in pre tax realized losses of approximately  the fair value of these securities had not changed significantly in compared to december  all of these securities were sold upon the recommendation of the outside investment manager  based upon the desire to maintain the overall credit quality of the portfolio or in response to the underlying business fundamentals relating to the securities 
finally  upon exercise of an issuer call option  one preferred stock produced consideration of million and a pre tax realized loss of  year ended december  compared to year ended december  net realized investment losses were  for the year ended december  compared to  for the year ended december  through september   the net realized investment gains were comprised of gains on sales of equity securities and corporate and agency bonds 
the net realized losses in the fourth quarter of were comprised of osprey bond  e health solutions group  treasury securities  miscellaneous gains  total  the loss realized on the osprey bond an enron partnership represents our entire exposure to enron securities 
in addition  we realized a loss from a start up equity investment in e health solutions group  a medical information technology company that is developing software products to be used by healthcare companies 
while the investment in e health solutions group may produce value in future periods  an evaluation conducted during the fourth quarter concluded that under gaap  we needed to write off the carrying value of the investment 
the realized investment losses in were from the sale of us government and agencies securities partially offset by realized gains from the sale of asset and mortgage backed securities 
practice management and related income revenue for practice management and related services is comprised of fees for the following categories of services provided in practice management  accounting  tax and personal financial planning  retirement plan accounting and administration  and all other services year ended december  compared to year ended december  practice management and related revenues decreased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this revenue consists of fees generated by ncric mso through its healthcare consulting and employee benefits services divisions 
the decreased revenue was a result of a reduced level of non recurring consulting assignments in the healthcare consulting division compared to year ended december  compared to year ended december  practice management and related revenues increased by  or  to million for the year ended december   from million for the year ended december  this revenue consists of fees generated by ncric mso through healthcare consulting and employee benefits services 
the increased revenue is a result of the focused efforts on new business development through the addition of new clients in both recurring business and one time consulting assignments and the increase in consulting rates 
other income other income includes revenues from insurance brokerage  insurance agency and physician services  as well as service charge income from installment payments for our insurance premium billings 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  other income increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increased revenue resulted primarily from increased brokerage reinsurance treaty commission income generated by the increased current year reinsurance ceded premiums and from services fees generated by premium installment payments 
in late we began offering an installment payment option to our insureds 
as a result  the revenue generated by service fees on installment payments grew throughout compared to year ended december  compared to year ended december  other income increased  or  to  for the year ended december  from  for the year ended december  the increased revenue resulted primarily from increased brokerage reinsurance treaty commission income generated by the increased current year reinsurance ceded premiums 
losses and loss adjustment expenses incurred and combined ratio results the expense for incurred losses and lae for each year is summarized as follows 
all loss expense amounts incurred are reported net of reinsurance amounts recoverable 
year ended december  in thousands incurred losses and lae related to current year losses    prior years loss development    total incurred for the year    traditionally  property and casualty insurer results are judged using ratios of losses and underwriting expenses compared to net premiums earned 
following is a summary of these ratios for each period 
year ended december  losses and lae ratio current year losses prior years loss development total losses and lae ratio underwriting expense ratio combined ratio the combined ratio and its component loss and underwriting expense ratios are profitability measures used throughout the insurance industry as a relative measure of underwriting performance 
insurance premium rates are designed to cover the costs of providing insurance coverage 
these costs include loss expenses arising from indemnity claims  costs required to adjudicate claims  and costs to issue and service insurance policies 
the calculations show the cost of each expense component as a percentage of earned premium income 
a general guide for interpreting the combined ratio is a lower ratio indicates greater profitability than does a higher ratio 
the resolution of many of the claims reported to us is determined through a trial 
following is a summary of the trial results for each period 
year ended december  plaintiff verdicts defense verdicts mistrials or hung juries total trials of the five plaintiff verdicts in  three verdicts were awarded in excess of our  retention 
of the five plaintiff verdicts in  one verdict was awarded in excess of our  retention 
no verdicts exceeded our  retention in year ended december  compared to year ended december  total incurred losses and lae expense of million for year ended december  represented an increase of million  or  compared to million incurred for the year ended december  the total incurred losses are broken into two components incurred losses related to the current coverage year and development on prior coverage year losses 
current year incurred losses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december   reflecting the rise in the level of liability exposure as a result of expanding business  combined with a moderation of claims frequency 
prior year development results from the re estimation and resolution of individual losses not covered by reinsurance  which are generally losses under  in we experienced unfavorable development of million on estimated losses for prior years claims 
the re estimation of loss cost takes into consideration a variety of factors including recent claims settlement experience  new information on open claims  and changes in the judicial environment 
the primary factors driving our development  which is comprised of favorable development in the report year offset by adverse development in the  and report years  include additional information on claims originally reported in prior years and interpretation of emerging settlement trends in our expansion market areas 
an increase in severity was first noted in and continued through for claims reported in the district of columbia 
the increase in severity reflects the growing size of plaintiff verdicts and settlements 
our escalation in this adverse claims trend is similar to the conditions faced by many medical professional liability insurance carriers across the nation 
while an increase in severity would tend to cause loss ratios to deteriorate  our reinsurance program for losses in excess of  provides a layer of protection against the increase in severity of losses 
in the market territories outside of the district of columbia  or our expansion market areas  our experience covers a time period insufficient to make a determination on severity trends 
in these new market areas  we carefully evaluate developing data to identify and recognize emerging trends as soon as possible 
the total losses and lae ratio was increased by points for the year ended december  and was decreased by points for the year ended december  as a result of prior years loss development 
the change is primarily reflective of favorable loss development for the and loss years  more than offset by adverse development in the  and loss years  whereas  the change is primarily reflective of the favorable loss development for the   and loss years  partially offset by adverse development in the loss year 
the underwriting expense ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this increase is reflective of the reserve against the hospital sponsored program receivable of million  as previously discussed 
underwriting expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of the increase in underwriting expenses  was attributed to the receivable allowance  this translates into an addition of to the underwriting expense ratio 
see underwriting expenses 
the combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the primary factor driving the increased combined ratio was the increase in underwriting expenses offset by a lower incurred loss ratio 
the statutory combined ratio was for the year ended december   and the same for the year ended december  this includes a slight decrease in the loss ratio offset by a slight increase in the expense ratio  reflecting the same premium  loss and expense factors noted previously 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  total incurred losses and lae expense of million for year ended december  represented an increase of million  or  compared to million incurred for the year ended december  the total incurred losses are broken into two components  incurred losses related to the current coverage year and development on prior coverage year losses 
current year incurred losses increased by million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  reflecting the rise in the level of liability exposure as a result of expanding business  an increase in the frequency of reported claims  and a rise in the cost of adjudicating and settling claims 
an increase in severity was first noted in and continued through the increase in severity reflects the growing size of plaintiff verdicts and settlements 
our escalation in this adverse claims trend is similar to the conditions faced by many medical professional liability insurance carriers across the nation 
while an increase in severity would tend to cause loss ratios to deteriorate  our reinsurance program for losses in excess of  provides protection against the increase in severity of losses 
we experienced favorable development on estimated losses for prior year s claims for both years 
prior year development results from the re estimation and settlement of individual losses not covered by reinsurance  which are generally losses under  the favorable loss development related to prior years claims was million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the total losses and lae ratio was reduced by points for the year ended december  and points for the year ended december   as a result of this favorable development 
the change is primarily reflective of the favorable loss development for the   and loss years  partially offset by adverse development in the loss year  whereas  the change is primarily reflective of the favorable loss development for the   and loss years  partially offset by adverse development in the loss year 
the reduced level of favorable development in compared to reflects claims closed as well as the continuing upward pressure of severity of losses noted above 
the underwriting expense ratio decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  this decrease is reflective of the increase in net earned premiums partially offset by the increase in underwriting expenses 
underwriting expenses increased million to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  of the increase in underwriting expenses  was attributed to a guaranty fund assessment of  this translates into an addition of to the underwriting expense ratio 
see underwriting expenses 
the combined ratio increased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  the primary factor driving the increased combined ratio was the increase in incurred losses stemming from the lower favorable prior year loss development 
the statutory combined ratio was for the year ended december  compared to for the year ended december  this increase reflects the same premium and loss level factors noted previously 
three months ended december  compared to three months ended december  the fourth quarter expense for incurred losses and lae net of reinsurance is summarized as follows year ended december  in thousands incurred losses and lae related to current year losses   prior years development  total incurred for the quarter   total incurred losses and lae expense of million for the fourth quarter of increased by million over the fourth quarter of the increase in current year losses to million for the fourth quarter of reflects the increase in the level of liability exposure as a result of our expanding business and a rise in the cost of settling claims 
the lower level of favorable development of losses reported in prior years reflects the experience on the claims closed during the quarter as well as the continuing upward pressure of severity of losses as reported previously 
losses and loss adjustment expenses liability the losses and lae reserve liabilities for unpaid claims as of each period are as follows at december  in thousands liability for loss   loss adjustment expense   total liability   reinsurance recoverable on losses   number of cases pending each case represents claims against one or more policyholders relating to a single incident 
losses in the medical professional liability industry can take up to eight to ten years  or occasionally more  to fully resolve 
amounts are not due from the reinsurers until we pay a claim 
we believe that all of our reinsurance recoverables are collectible 
see business reinsurance for a discussion on the reinsurance program 
underwriting expenses for  salaries and benefits accounted for approximately of other underwriting expenses  bad debt expense  with professional fees  including legal  auditing and director s fees  accounting for approximately another of the underwriting expenditures 
the amortization of premium taxes and commissions related to the change in unearned premiums reflects the balance 
guaranty fund assessments are based on industry loss experience in the jurisdictions where we do business  which loss experience is not entirely predictable 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  underwriting expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  from million for the year ended december  the increase in expenses primarily stems from the increase in new business  particularly agent produced business  through increases in commissions  travel  and other underwriting costs 
these expenses were partially offset by an increase in ceding allowances as a result of the increase in premiums earned 
underwriting expenses also increased due to legal fees incurred for the collection litigation initiated by us and for the million addition to the allowance for uncollectible premiums  as more fully discussed in the section net premiums earned 
in addition  we received guaranty fund assessments totaling  stemming from the insolvency of phico insurance company 
there is the possibility we could be assessed additional amounts in the future 
however  since the amount of any potential future assessment is not reasonably estimable at this time  no additional expense accrual has been recorded

in addition  we received a guaranty fund assessment from the dc guaranty fund of  stemming from the insolvency of reliance insurance company 
there is the possibility we could be assessed additional amounts in the future 
however  since the amount of any potential future assessment is not reasonably estimable at this time  no additional expense accrual has been recorded 
no similar assessment was received in practice management and related expenses practice management and related expenses consist primarily of expenses  such as salaries  general office expenses and interest on debt  related to ncric mso operations of the businesses acquired january  the management services organization was established in to provide physicians with a variety of administrative support and other services but did not have substantive operations until year ended december  compared to year ended december  practice management and related expenses decreased  million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  expense decreased due to the cessation of goodwill amortization with the implementation of sfas effective january  partially offset by additional expenses associated with the transition of client service for two of the former owners as they moved towards the expiration of their employment contracts at the end of and other transitional costs associated with the continued integration of the purchased companies 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  practice management and related expenses increased million  or  to million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  expenses increased as a result of the growth in new business and business development efforts during in addition  goodwill amortization increased by  interest expense increased  and compensation expense increased by  as a result of the contingent purchase payments made in to the prior owners of healthcare consulting  inc  hci ventures  llc  and employee benefits services  inc 
three months ended december  compared to three months ended december  practice management and related expenses of million in the fourth quarter of increased over the million incurred in the fourth quarter of due to the same factors influencing the growth of expenses throughout the year  that is  expenses associated with the growth of new business and with the contingent purchase payments made in additional fourth quarter expense included increases for bad debts and employee compensation 
other expenses other expenses include expenditures for holding company and subsidiary operations which are not directly related to the issuance of medical professional liability insurance or practice management and related operations  including insurance brokerage  insurance agency  and captive development 
in april  we announced the formation of acc  a wholly owned subsidiary and the first captive insurance company to be licensed in the district of columbia under the captive insurance act of as a captive insurance company  acc was established to provide an alternative risk financing vehicle for affinity groups 
the captive program is marketed to organizations and groups wishing to finance and manage their own risk 
during  acc incurred  in expenses 
while one sponsored cell contract has been signed  the captive cell has not yet begun operations due to delays in regulatory approval in west virginia 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  other expenses of million for the year ended december  increased  or compared to the year ended december  expense increases are for captive business development costs and holding company operations 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  other expenses of million for the year ended december  are unchanged from the expense level for the year ended december  other expenses include amounts incurred to meet the various requirements associated with having common stock traded in the public market  the expense of the stock grants made in september  under the stock award plan  and  in   of start up expenses for the new captive insurance company subsidiary 
income taxes our effective tax rate is lower than the federal statutory rate principally due to nontaxable investment income 
year ended december  federal income tax at statutory rates tax exempt income dividends received goodwill amortization other  net income tax at effective rates our net deferred tax assets are created by temporary differences that will result in tax benefits in future years due to the differing treatment of items for tax and financial statement purposes 
the primary difference is the requirement to discount or reduce loss reserves for tax purposes because of their long term nature 
at december  deferred income tax asset   year ended december  compared to year ended december  the tax benefit for the year ended december  was  compared to tax expense of  for the year ended december  the federal corporate income tax rate of was adjusted to an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  due to tax exempt income and nontaxable dividends 
the increase in the deferred income tax asset to a balance of million as of december  resulted primarily from the growth of the insurance business  particularly in unearned premiums and loss reserves where the timing of recognition for financial statement and tax return reporting differ  in addition to completion of the amortization of the deferred tax liability that had arisen from a change in tax accounting method four years ago 
the increase in the deferred income tax asset was partially reduced by the deferred tax liability on unrealized investment gains 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  tax expense for the year ended december  was  compared to million for the year ended december  the federal corporate income tax rate of was reduced to an effective tax rate of for the year ended december  due to tax exempt income and nontaxable dividends received  partially offset by non deductible goodwill amortization and other  principally state income taxes 
the effective rate of for the year ended december  was higher than the effective rate primarily due to a lower level of tax exempt income in the decrease in the provision for income tax is reflective of the decreased income before tax combined with the decrease in the effective tax rate 
financial condition  liquidity and capital resources ncric group  parent company financial condition and capital resources 
we are a stock holding company whose operations and assets primarily consist of its ownership of ncric  inc and ncric mso  inc 
we assist our subsidiaries in their efforts to compete effectively and create long term growth 
as a part of this strategy  we may seek to take advantage of acquisition opportunities and alternative financing 
in december  we completed the private placement sale of million of year floating rate trust preferred securities 
the securities are callable at par five years from the date of issuance 
the interest rate on the securities is floating at the month london interbank offered rate libor plus basis points 
the initial rate is 
we contributed million of the funds raised to the statutory surplus of our insurance subsidiaries 
liquidity 
liquidity is a measure of an entity s ability to secure enough cash to meet its contractual obligations and operating needs 
our cash flow from operations consists of dividends from our subsidiaries  if declared and paid  and other permissible payments from our subsidiaries  offset by holding company expenses  which consist of costs for corporate management and interest on the trust preferred securities 
the amount of the future cash flow available to us may be influenced by a variety of factors  including ncric  inc s financial results and regulation by the district of columbia department of insurance and securities regulation 
the payment of dividends to us by ncric  inc is subject to limitations imposed by the district of columbia holding company system act of under the dc holding company act  ncric  inc must seek prior approval from the commissioner to pay any dividend which  combined with other dividends made within the preceding months  exceeds the lesser of a of the surplus at the end of the prior year or b the prior year s net income excluding realized capital gains 
net income  excluding realized capital gains  for the years preceding the current year is carried forward for purposes of the calculation to the extent not paid in dividends 
the law also requires that an insurer s statutory surplus following a dividend or other distribution be reasonable in relation to the insurer s outstanding liabilities and adequate to meet its financial needs 
the district of columbia permits the payment of dividends only out of unassigned statutory surplus 
using these criteria  as of december   ncric  inc had approximately million of unassigned statutory surplus available for dividends 
ncric group and subsidiaries  consolidated liquidity 
the primary sources of our liquidity are insurance premiums  net investment income  practice management and financial services fees  recoveries from reinsurers and proceeds from the maturity or sale of invested assets 
funds are used to pay losses and lae  operating expenses  reinsurance premiums  taxes  and to purchase investments 
we had cash flows provided by used in operations for the years ended december  as follows million million million the million of decreased cash flow provided by operations in compared to results primarily from an increase in net claims and claims settlement cost payments and a change in the timing of the receipt of premiums 
prior to  a majority of insureds financed their annual premium through an outside financing company  which then remitted the full annual premium to us at the beginning of the policy year 
for policies with effective dates  we provide the option to policyholders to pay their premiums in installments throughout the policy year 
this has the impact of spreading the cash receipts from premiums over the policy year 
because of the long term nature of both the payments of claims and the settlement of swing rated reinsurance premiums due to reinsurers  cash from operations for a medical professional liability insurer like us can vary substantially from year to year 
comprehensive income was a gain of million for the year ended december  compared to million for the year ended december  the increase in comprehensive income results from the million increase in net unrealized investment gains  combined with the million lower net income 
financial condition and capital resources 
we invest our positive cash flow from operations primarily in investment grade  fixed maturity securities 
as of december   the carrying value of the securities portfolio was million  compared to a carrying value of million at december  the portfolios were invested as follows at december  us government and us asset and mortgage backed securities tax exempt securities corporate bonds equity securities over of the bond portfolio at december  was invested in us government and agency securities or has a rating of aaa or aa 
over of the bond portfolio as of december  was held in investment grade bbb or better securities as rated by standard poor s 
for regulatory purposes  as of december   of the portfolio is rated class  which is the highest quality rated group as classified by the naic 
the accumulated other comprehensive income totaled million at december  compared to  at december  this improvement in asset values resulted primarily from the reduction in market interest rates 
at december   our portfolio included total gross unrealized gains of million  or of the million carrying value of the portfolio  and total unrealized losses of  or less than of the carrying value of the portfolio 
the total unrealized losses are comprised of seventeen different securities  including eight treasury note issues  six corporate debt fixed maturity securities five of which are investment grade  with lengths of time to maturity ranging from nine to twenty eight years  two preferred stock issues  and one equity issue 
all of the fixed maturity securities are meeting and are expected to continue to meet all contractual obligations for interest payments 
at december   the aggregate fair value of the securities with unrealized losses was million  or of the aggregate carrying value of those securities of million 
the largest single security with an unrealized loss at december  relates to a bond issued by xerox capital trust  which matures in and carries a coupon rate of 
the unrealized pre tax loss relating to this security is approximately  based on the fair value of  at december  we will continue to actively monitor the financial position and outlook for this investment and take any action determined to be appropriate 
unrealized losses related to other securities are not individually significant  nor is there any concentration of unrealized losses with respect to the type of security or industry 
the following table displays characteristics of the securities with an unrealized loss in value as of december  no concentrations of industries exist in these securities 
total securities below investment grade and equity securities length of time in unrealized unrealized unrealized loss position amortized cost fair value loss amortized cost fair value loss in thousands less than year   over year     total     the following table displays the maturity distribution of those fixed maturity securities with an unrealized loss in value as of december  fixed maturity securities unrealized amortized cost fair value loss in thousands during one year or less due after one year through five years   due after five years through ten years  due after twenty years   total   we believe that all of our fixed maturity securities are readily marketable 
investment duration is closely monitored to provide adequate cash flow to meet operational and maturing liability needs 
asset and liability modeling  including sensitivity analyses and cash flow testing  are performed on a regular basis 
we are required to pay aggregate annual salaries in the amount of  to four persons under employment agreements 
under terms of the purchase agreement between the previous owners of healthcare consulting  inc  hci ventures  llc  employee benefits services  inc 
and us  contingency payments totaling million could be paid in cash if the acquired companies achieved earnings targets in   and during  the earnings target was met and we paid the prior owners million on march  after analyzing the acquired companies operations since the acquisition  terms were negotiated and agreed upon for an early payment of the second contingent payment originally scheduled to be paid in as a result  on june   we paid million  the present value of the remaining payments to the prior owners 
during june  ncric mso  inc borrowed  from suntrust bank to finance these payments 
the term of the loan is years at a floating rate of libor plus one and one half percent 
the interest rate was and at december  and december   respectively 
principal and interest payments are due on a monthly basis 
our stockholders equity totaled million at december  and million at december  the million increase for the year ended december  was due primarily to  of net income plus million of net unrealized investment gains 
the million increase for the year ended december  was primarily due to million of net income plus million of net unrealized investment gains 
effects of inflation and interest rate changes the primary effect of inflation on us is in estimating reserves for unpaid losses and lae for medical professional liability claims in which there is a long period between reporting and settlement 
the rate of inflation for malpractice claim settlements can substantially exceed the general rate of inflation 
the actual effect of inflation on our results cannot be conclusively known until claims are ultimately settled 
based on actual results to date  we believe that loss and lae reserve levels and our ratemaking process adequately incorporate the effects of inflation 
interest rate changes expose us to market risk on our investment portfolio 
this market risk is the potential for financial losses due to the decrease in the value or price of an asset resulting from broad movements in prices  such as interest rates 
in general  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuation in interest rates 
in addition  our net investment income increases or decreases in a direct relationship with interest rate changes on monies re invested from maturing securities and investments of positive cash flow from operating activities 
federal income tax matters for tax years prior to the stock offering  we filed a consolidated united states federal income tax return with our parent and subsidiaries 
for tax years after the stock offering  we do not file as part of a consolidated united states federal income tax return with ncric  a mutual holding company or ncric holdings because ncric  a mutual holding company and ncric holdings own directly and indirectly less than of the outstanding shares of ncric group 
tax years  and are open but not currently under audit 
in the internal revenue service approved a change in accounting method for us relative to the timing of revenue recognition for tax purposes 
regulatory matters naic statutory accounting codification 
the national association of insurance commissioners naic is an association of the insurance regulators of all states and the district of columbia 
the naic has codified the statutory accounting practices  which are the accounting rules and guidelines prescribed by the state insurance regulators 
the project was intended to re examine current statutory accounting practices and to ensure uniform accounting treatment from a regulatory standpoint 
many of the changes to statutory accounting are based on generally accepted accounting principles with modifications that emphasize the concept of conservatism and solvency inherent in statutory accounting 
the accounting mandated by the codification applied commencing january  statutory accounting changes resulting from this codification do not have an effect on the financial statements prepared in accordance with gaap  which have been included in this document and filed with the securities and exchange commission 
the effect on our statutory surplus on january  was an increase of million 
this increase is mainly due to the effect of accounting changes related to the implementation of deferred taxes and the removal of the excess of statutory reserves over statement reserves penalty  offset by charges to surplus for overdue receivables 
naic iris ratios 
the naic insurance regulatory information system iris is an early warning system that is primarily intended to be utilized by state and district of columbia insurance department regulators to assist in their review and oversight of the financial condition and results of operations of insurance companies operating in their respective jurisdictions 
iris is a ratio analysis system that is administered by the naic 
the naic provides state and district of columbia insurance department regulators with ratio reports for each insurer within their jurisdiction based on standardized annual financial statements submitted by the insurers 
iris identifies ratios to be analyzed for a property casualty insurer  and specifies a range of values for each of these ratios 
the ratios address various aspects of each insurer s financial condition and stability including profitability  liquidity  reserve adequacy and overall analytical ratios 
departure from the usual range of a ratio may require the submission of an explanation to the state or district of columbia insurance regulator 
departure from the usual range on four or more ratios may lead to increased regulatory oversight 
for and  our subsidiary cml was outside the usual range on three ratios 
the ratio results were impacted by two primary factors the rapid increase in new premium written in cml and the increase in severity of losses  particularly the adverse development in losses of one prior year 
in the opinion of management  because of the reasons for the ratio results for the current year  the ratio results are not indicative of operational problems in this subsidiary 
for and  another subsidiary  ncric  inc  was outside the usual range for two ratios as the result of the rapid increase in premiums and the increase in severity of losses  particularly the adverse development of prior year losses 
naic risk based capital 
the naic has established a methodology for assessing the adequacy of each insurer s capital position based on the level of statutory surplus and an evaluation of the risks in the insurer s product mix and investment portfolio profile 
this risk based capital rbc formula is designed to allow state and district of columbia insurance regulators to identify potentially under capitalized companies 
for property casualty insurers  the formula takes into account risks related to the insurer s assets including risks related to its investment portfolio  and the insurer s liabilities  including risks related to the adverse development of coverages underwritten 
the rbc rules provide for different levels of regulatory attention depending on the ratio of the insurer s total adjusted capital to the authorized control level of rbc 
the first level of regulatory action  a review by the domiciliary insurance commissioner of a company prepared rbc plan  is instituted at the point a company s total adjusted capital is at a level equal to or less than two times greater than the authorized control level risk based capital 
for all periods presented  the total adjusted capital levels for ncric  inc and cml were significantly in excess of the authorized control level of rbc 
as a result  the rbc requirements are not expected to have an impact on our operations 
following is a presentation of the total adjusted capital for ncric  inc and cml compared to the authorized control level of rbc authorized control level risk based capital total adjusted capital ncric  inc

quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market price our investment portfolio is exposed to various market risks  including interest rate and equity price risk 
market risk is the potential for financial losses due to the decrease in the value or price of an asset resulting from broad movements in prices 
at december   fixed maturity securities comprised of total investments at fair value 
us government and tax exempt bonds represent of the fixed maturity securities 
equity securities  consisting primarily preferred stock  account for the remainder of the investment portfolio 
we have classified our investments as available for sale 
because of the high percentage of fixed maturity securities  interest rate risk represents the greatest exposure we have on our investment portfolio 
in general  the market value of our fixed maturity portfolio increases or decreases in an inverse relationship with fluctuation in interest rates 
during periods of rising interest rates  the fair value of our investment portfolio will generally decline resulting in decreases in our stockholders equity 
conversely  during periods of falling interest rates  the fair value of our investment portfolio will generally increase resulting in increases in our stockholders equity 
in addition  our net investment income increases or decreases in a direct relationship with interest rate changes on monies reinvested from maturing securities and investments of positive cash flow from operating activities 
generally  the longer the duration of the security  the more sensitive the asset is to market interest rate fluctuations 
to control the adverse effects of the changes in interest rates  our investment portfolio of fixed maturity securities consists primarily of intermediate term  investment grade securities 
our fixed income portfolio at december  reflected an average effective maturity of years and an average modified duration of years 
our investment policy also provides that all security purchases be limited to rated securities or unrated securities approved by management on the recommendation of our investment advisor 
over of our bond portfolio as of december  was held in investment grade securities 
during the early part of  there was a change in the allocation of our portfolio which increased the proportion of tax exempt securities in the portfolio for the purpose of maximizing after tax yields while minimizing portfolio credit risk 
in december  the funds provided through issuance of the trust preferred securities were invested in us treasury securities  decreasing the percentage of tax exempt and corporate bonds to of the total fixed maturity securities compared to at december  one common measure of the interest sensitivity of fixed maturity securities is effective duration 
effective duration utilizes maturities  yields  and call terms to calculate an average age of expected cash flows 
the following table shows the estimated fair value of our fixed maturity portfolio based on fluctuations in the market interest rates 
projected market yield change value bp market yield in millions current yield current yield is as of december  the actual impact of the market interest rate changes on the securities may differ from those shown in the sensitivity analysis above
