item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations management s discussion and analysis contains statements that are forward looking 
these statements are based on current expectations and assumptions that are subject to risks and uncertainties 
actual results could differ materially because of factors discussed in factors that may affect future results and financial condition 
pooling of interests on june   we acquired ms carriers through the merger of a wholly owned subsidiary with and into ms carriers the merger 
the merger has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  all historical financial data discussed below has been restated to include the financial position  results of operations  and cash flows of ms carriers 
in addition  the results for include a million increase to ms carriers insurance and claims reserves  a million adjustment  of which million relates to the impairment of its equity investment held by ms carriers in transportes easo  the largest intra mexico truckload carrier  and million is associated with the write off of a cash advance made to easo in the third quarter of  and 
table of contents a million adjustment for the change in market value of the interest rate derivative agreements of ms carriers 
prior to the merger  ms carriers calculated a range of claims reserves and recorded in their financial statements an amount that they believed was appropriate 
we believed  based upon our experience with historical development trends  it was more appropriate to record amounts at a higher level within the range 
upon closing the merger with ms carriers  we completed our evaluation of the claims exposure of ms carriers and recorded a million increase in this accrual 
ms carriers held the equity investment in transportes easo prior to its merger with swift 
nothing came to our attention to indicate there was an impairment of this investment during the acquisition process or the period subsequent to the merger and prior to the august request from transportes easo management for an advance to meet its cash requirements 
the million cash advance to transportes easo was made in august as a result of this advance  we began an evaluation of this investment 
based upon our evaluation  it was our determination that there had been a significant decline in the value of easo and that it was impaired 
therefore  we adjusted the carrying value of the investment 
overview we are the largest publicly held truckload carrier in the united states 
as part of the truckload segment of the trucking industry  we transport freight for shippers in large quantities who generally pay for our services based upon miles of delivery 
our fleet of tractors and trailers is as follows as of december  tractors company owned leased total company owner operator total trailers the company tractors are either owned by the company or financed under leases 
our fleet has operated on a three year cycle for many years 
generally  we traded a tractor for a new tractor every three years 
we are currently evaluating extending this three year cycle 
the owner operators own their tractor and are responsible for operating costs 
the owner operators operate under the authority of the company and are generally compensated based upon miles 
trucking revenue is revenue from freight hauled on our fleet 
there are three factors that significantly impact our trucking revenue 
first  as mentioned above  the truckload industry in which we operate is generally compensated based upon miles 
therefore  an increase in miles will increase the revenue 
we monitor utilization of our tractors in the form of miles per tractor per week 
the second factor is revenue per mile 
increases in revenue per mile will increase revenue 
we monitor our revenue per mile on a daily basis 
finally  the percentage of miles our tractors travel that do not generate revenue  known as deadhead  will adversely affect revenue 
we monitor deadhead miles on a daily basis 
in addition to trucking revenue  our operating revenue includes fuel surcharge revenue and other revenue primarily for freight moved for our customers on rail or purchased transportation 
we are also compensated  in some instances  for accessorial charges such as loading and unloading 

table of contents we view our operating cost structure as approximately one half variable and one half fixed 
therefore  an increase in revenue will generally improve our operating margin percentage 
critical accounting policies claims accruals we are self insured for some portion of our liability  property damage and cargo damage risk 
this self insurance results from buying insurance coverage with deductible amounts 
each reporting period we accrue the cost of the uninsured portion of pending claims 
these accruals are estimated based on our evaluation of the nature and severity of individual claims and an estimate of future claims development based upon historical claims development trends 
insurance and claims expense will vary as a percentage of operating revenue from period to period based on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period as well as changes in claims development trends 
we have discussed the development and selection of this accounting estimate with the audit committee of the board of directors and the audit committee has reviewed the company s disclosure relating to it in this annual report on form k 
revenue recognition operating revenues and related direct costs are recognized as of the date the freight is picked up for shipment 
ms carriers see pooling of interests note recognized revenue on the date freight was delivered 
beginning january   ms carriers was operationally combined with the company and recognizes revenue on the date freight is picked up for shipment 
our revenue recognition policy is consistent with method two under eitf we do not believe the financial results derived from the application of this method differ materially from the results that would be derived under method three discussed within eitf due to the company s relatively short length of haul 
results of operations for  and the following table sets forth for the periods indicated certain statement of earnings data as a percentage of operating revenue for the years ending december operating revenue operating expenses salaries  wages and employee benefits operating supplies and expenses fuel purchased transportation rental expense insurance and claims depreciation and amortization communications and utilities operating taxes and licenses total operating expenses 
table of contents operating income net interest expense other income expense  net earnings before income taxes income taxes net earnings our net earnings declined from million in to million in while our operating revenue increased million  the incremental profit from the increased volume was more than offset by the merger related adjustments  increased deadhead  rising insurance costs and increased operating supplies as we standardized our fleets 
in  our net earnings increased to million 
although trucking revenue was down from  lower interest expense  the lack of integration adjustments  and merger related synergies all contributed to our rise in net earnings 
revenue as discussed above  we believe there are three factors that have a significant impact on our trucking revenue 
these three factors  along with operating revenue and its components dollars in thousands are shown in the table below for the last three years 
trucking revenue fuel surcharge revenue other revenue operating revenue miles per tractor per week revenue per loaded mile deadhead percentage our trucking revenue decreased by approximately in compared to and increased in compared to comparing to  the improvement in deadhead percentage and revenue per loaded mile was offset by a decrease in utilization 
we began with approximately trucks without drivers 
the number of trucks without drivers decreased throughout and we ended the year with approximately trucks without drivers 
comparing to  the increase in deadhead percentage and slight decrease in utilization was more than offset by our increase in revenue per loaded mile 
other revenue increased in compared to primarily due to an increase in freight moved for our customers on rail and mexican carriers 
in july  we transferred our logistics business and associated intangible assets to transplace  an internet based logistics company we commonly own with four other truckload carriers 
therefore  included million of other revenue that did not recur in or we own approximately of transplace and account for our investment in transplace using the equity method of accounting 
operating expenses our most significant operating costs are salaries  wages and employee benefits  fuel and purchased transportation 
our salaries  wages and employee benefits were  and of operating revenue in  and  respectively 
the percentage decreased slightly in as we experienced some headcount attrition that was offset by an increase in workers compensation costs 
our deductible amount for workers compensation rose from zero to  per incident in beginning in  this deductible 
table of contents amount for workers compensation will rise from  to  per incident 
this percentage rose in as the mix in the company owned portion of our total fleet increased as the owner operator portion decreased 
this increase is also due to the impact of reduced utilization and an increase in dedicated business with fixed pay driver wages 
from time to time the industry has experienced shortages of qualified drivers 
if such a shortage were to occur over a prolonged period and increases in driver pay rates were to occur in order to attract and retain drivers  our results of operations would be negatively impacted to the extent we did not obtain corresponding rate increases 
fuel was  and of operating revenue in  and  respectively 
this percentage is primarily affected by fuel prices 
our average fuel cost per gallon was  and  in  and  respectively 
increases in fuel costs  to the extent not offset by rate increases or fuel surcharges  would have an adverse effect on our operations and profitability 
we believe that the most effective protection against fuel cost increases is to maintain a fuel efficient fleet and to implement fuel surcharges when such an option is necessary and available 
we do not use derivative type hedging products  but periodically evaluate their possible use 
purchased transportation was  and of operating revenue in  and  respectively 
this percentage has dropped as our owner operator fleet has decreased from  at december  to  at december  insurance and claims was  and of operating revenue in  and  respectively 
the year ended december  includes a million increase to ms carriers insurance and claims reserves and million of increased insurance premiums  with the same coverage  over the prior year 
we experienced an increase in auto liability claims and cargo theft claims in when compared to as discussed under critical accounting policies  we are self insured for some portion of our liability  property damage and cargo damage risk 
we buy insurance coverage with deductible amounts 
beginning in  the deductible amount for general liability will rise from  to  per incident 
this expense will vary as a percentage of operating revenue from period to period based on the frequency and severity of claims incurred in a given period as well as changes in claims development trends 
as we discussed in the notes to our financial statements  we entered into a settlement agreement with an insurance company 
pursuant to this settlement  the insurance company agreed to provide certain insurance coverage  at no cost to the company  through december  in exchange our releasing all claims that were the subject of the litigation 
we will recognize this settlement amount as a reduction of insurance expense as the insurance coverage is provided during the period from july  through december  in addition  we deferred the million of legal expenses  which were paid pursuant to a contingent fee arrangement based upon our estimate of the value of the insurance provided of between million and million 
these legal expenses are being amortized on a straight line basis over the thirty month period beginning july  in the event that we do not receive the future insurance coverage due to the liquidation  rehabilitation  bankruptcy or other similar insolvency of the insurers  we will receive a reimbursement of our legal expenses on a declining basis ranging from million through december  to million through july  when it is economically advantageous to do so  we will purchase and then resell tractors that we currently lease by exercising the purchase option contained in the lease 
gains on these activities are recorded as a reduction of rental expense 
we also generate gains from the sale of tractors we own 
these gains are recorded as a reduction of depreciation expense 
these gains are summarized below 
in thousands gain on sale of leased tractors gain on sale of owned tractors 
table of contents other expenses our largest pre tax non operating expense is interest 
our debt balance combining the operating line of credit  accounts receivable securitization  capital leases and other debt was million  million and million at december   and  respectively 
as shown below  our interest expense  net of the impact of the derivative agreements decreased in as we reduced debt by million 
our interest expense further decreased in as we shifted to lower cost borrowings and interest rates continued to decline 
in thousands interest expense less derivative agreements interest expense  net of derivative agreements included in other expense in was the company s share of a nonrecurring charge within the earnings of our equity investment in transplace  which amounted to million 
other expense in included an million adjustment for the impairment of the equity investment held by ms carriers in transportes easo  and the equity loss of million for transplace 
our effective tax rate was  and in  and  respectively 
the increase in was primarily due to the nondeductible portion million of the easo impairment adjustment 
liquidity and capital resources our cash flow sources and uses by operating  investing and financing activities are shown below in thousands net cash provided by operating activities net cash used in investing activities net cash used in provided by financing activities although net earnings increased substantially  our cash provided by operating activities increased slightly in compared to primarily because our accounts receivable increased by a comparable amount 
our cash provided by operating activities increased in compared to despite lower net earnings 
this was a result of an increase in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and claims accruals and a decrease in accounts receivable 
our cash used in investing activities is mainly driven by our capital expenditures  net of sales proceeds 
our capital expenditures  net of cash sales proceeds were million  million and million in  and  respectively 
in addition  we made equity investments of million in and loans to investment entities of million in regarding our financing activities  in we repurchased million of our common stock and received million from issuance of stock to our employees under the stock option and stock purchase plans 
in  we repaid a total of million of long term debt  capital leases and borrowings under revolving credit agreement and received million from our public stock offering and million from issuance of stock to our employees 
in  we increased our borrowings million and repurchased million of our common stock while receiving million from issuance of stock to our employees 
as of december  and we had a working capital deficit of  and  respectively  and as of december   our working capital was  as discussed in the notes to the financial statements  the accounts receivable securitization is reflected as a current liability because the committed term  subject to annual renewals  is days 
the funds received under the accounts receivable securitization are generally used for capital expenditures or repurchases of our common stock 
therefore  our working capital 
table of contents will be reduced by the amount of the proceeds received under the accounts receivable securitization but the increase in fixed assets or treasury stock is not included in working capital 
as of december   we have million of borrowings and million of letters of credit outstanding on our million line of credit  leaving million available 
interest on outstanding borrowings is based upon one of two options  which we select at the time of borrowing the bank s prime rate or the london interbank offered rate libor plus applicable margins ranging from to basis points  as defined in the credit agreement currently basis points 
the unused portion of the line of credit is subject to a commitment fee ranging from to basis points currently basis points 
the credit agreement requires us to meet certain covenants with respect to leverage and fixed charge coverage ratios and tangible net worth 
the credit agreement also requires us to maintain unencumbered assets of not less than of indebtedness as defined 
our accounts receivable securitization allows us to sell up to million of our eligible trade accounts receivable to a financial institution 
as of december   we had received sales proceeds of million 
as of december   we had commitments outstanding to acquire replacement and additional revenue equipment for approximately million 
we have the option to cancel such commitments upon days notice 
we believe it will be able to support these acquisitions of revenue equipment through debt and lease financings and cash flows generated by operating activities 
during the year ended december   we incurred approximately million of non revenue equipment capital expenditures 
these expenditures were primarily for facilities and equipment 
we anticipate that we will expend approximately million in for various facilities upgrades and acquisition and development of terminal facilities 
factors such as costs and opportunities for future terminal expansions may change the amount of such expenditures 
we believe we will be able to finance needs for working capital  facilities improvements and expansion  as well as anticipated fleet growth  with cash flows from operations  borrowings available under the line of credit  accounts receivable securitization and with long term debt and lease financing believed to be available to finance revenue equipment purchases 
over the long term  we will continue to have significant capital requirements  which may require us to seek additional borrowings or equity capital 
the availability of debt financing or equity capital will depend upon our financial condition and results of operations as well as prevailing market conditions  the market price of our common stock and other factors over which we have little or no control 
off balance sheet arrangements as discussed in the commitments note to the financial statements  we have guaranteed certain financing arrangements of entities in which we hold equity interests 
these guarantees were issued to assist these entities when entering into financing arrangements 
furthermore  the company guarantees certain residual values under its operating lease agreements for revenue equipment 
at the termination of these operating leases  the company would be responsible for the excess of the guarantee amount above the fair market value  if any 
the maximum potential amount of future payments the company would be required to make under these guarantees is million 
the company utilizes operating leases as an additional financing source 

table of contents contractual obligations the tables below summarize our contractual obligations as of december  payments due by period less than more than total year years years years long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases purchase obligations other long term obligations total contractual obligations we expect to refinance the million line of credit included in long term debt upon maturity 
operating leases include an interest element within the commitment amount as opposed to the long term debt and capital lease obligations amounts  which do not include an interest element 
inflation inflation can be expected to have an impact on our operating costs 
a prolonged period of inflation would cause interest rates  fuel  wages and other costs to increase and would adversely affect our results of operations unless freight rates could be increased correspondingly 
however  the effect of inflation has been minimal over the past three years 
seasonality in the transportation industry  results of operations generally show a seasonal pattern as customers reduce shipments after the winter holiday season 
our operating expenses also tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather  which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time 
accounting standards not yet adopted by the company the financial accounting standards board has issued statements of financial accounting standard sfas and interpretations fin for which the required implementation dates have not yet become effective 
those standards that may materially impact the company are discussed below 
in december  sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  was issued 
this standard provides guidance on the transition  if a company so elects  from the intrinsic value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation under accounting principles board opinion no 
 which the company currently uses  to the fair value method of accounting under sfas no 
in addition  this standard now requires certain disclosures in our interim financial statements that previously were only required in our annual report on form k 
the standard is effective for the company beginning january  the company has not yet made a decision on the adoption of the fair value method of accounting for stock options under sfas no 
in november  fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others was issued 
this standard requires a guarantor recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
the standard also elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the recognition provisions of this standard apply to guarantees issued or modified after december  the disclosure provisions of this standard apply to our financial statements for the year ended december  under this new standard  the company will be required to recognize a liability for the guarantee of residual values on any new operating 
table of contents leases or any other guarantees it modifies or issues 
presently  the company is not able to estimate the impact on its financial statements of the implementation of the recognition provisions of this standard 
factors that may affect future results and financial condition the company s future operating results and financial condition are dependent on the company s ability to successfully provide truckload carrier services to meet dynamic customer demand patterns 
inherent in this process are a number of factors that the company must successfully manage in order to achieve favorable future operating results and financial condition 
potential risks and uncertainties that could affect the company s future operating results and financial condition include  without limitation  the factors discussed below 
general economic and business factors 
the company s business is dependent upon a number of factors that may have a material adverse effect on its results of operations  many of which are beyond the company s control 
these factors include excess capacity in the trucking industry  significant increases or rapid fluctuations in fuel prices  interest rates  fuel taxes  tolls  license and registration fees and insurance and claims costs  to the extent not offset by increases in freight rates or fuel surcharges  and difficulty in attracting and retaining qualified drivers and owner operators 
the company s results of operations also are affected by recessionary economic cycles and downturns in customers business cycles  particularly in market segments and industries such as retail  manufacturing and paper products in which the company has a concentration of customers 
in addition  the company s results of operations are affected by seasonal factors 
customers tend to reduce shipments after the winter holiday season and the company s operating expenses tend to be higher in the winter months primarily due to colder weather which causes higher fuel consumption from increased idle time 
competition 
the trucking industry is extremely competitive and fragmented 
the company competes with many other truckload carriers of varying sizes and  to a lesser extent  with railroads 
competition has created downward pressure on the truckload industry s pricing structure 
there are some trucking companies with which the company competes that have greater financial resources than the company  and one may own more revenue equipment and carry a larger volume of freight than the company 
capital requirements 
the trucking industry is very capital intensive 
the company depends on cash from operations  operating leases and debt financing for funds to expand the size of its fleet and maintain modern revenue equipment 
if the company were unable in the future to enter into acceptable financing arrangements  it would have to limit its growth and might be required to operate its revenue equipment for longer periods  which could have a material adverse effect on the company s operating results 
acquisitions 
the growth of the company has been dependent in part upon the acquisition of trucking companies throughout the united states 
to date  the company has been successful in identifying trucking companies to acquire and in integrating such companies operations into the company s operations 
the company may face competition from transportation companies or other third parties for acquisition opportunities that become available 
there can be no assurance that the company will identify acquisition candidates that will result in successful combinations in the future 
any future acquisitions by the company may result in the incurrence of additional debt  which could adversely affect the company s profitability  or could involve the potentially dilutive issuance of additional equity securities 
in addition  acquisitions involve numerous risks  including difficulties in assimilation of the acquired company s operations particularly in the period immediately following the consummation of such transactions  the diversion of the attention of the company s management from other business  and the potential loss of customers  key employees and drivers of the acquired company  all of which could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is highly dependent upon the services of mr 
jerry moyes  chairman of the board  president and chief executive officer  mr 
william f 
riley  iii  senior executive vice president  mr 
gary enzor  chief financial officer  mr 
rodney k

table of contents carriers 
mr 
moyes has other significant business interests to which he devotes his time and efforts  including serving as chairman of central freight lines  inc  a regional less than truckload carrier

although the company believes it has an experienced and talented management group  the loss of the services of mr 
moyes  mr 
riley  mr 
enzor  mr

farley  mr 
jensen could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations and future profitability

riley  enzor  sartor  farley  or jensen 
the company does not have an employment agreement with but does maintain key man life insurance on mr 
moyes 
the company has employment agreements with messrs 
starnes and welch  which were entered into in connection with the merger with ms carriers  but does not maintain key man life insurance on any of them 
the employment agreement with mr 
starnes expires june   and the employment agreement with mr 
welch expires on june  regulation 
the company is regulated by the united states department of transportation 
this regulatory authority exercises broad powers  generally governing activities such as authorization to engage in motor carrier operations  safety  financial reporting  and certain mergers  consolidations and acquisitions 
swift may also become subject to new or more comprehensive or restrictive regulations relating to fuel emissions  ergonomics and limitations on hours of service 
the increased cost of complying with such regulations could have a material adverse effect on swift s business and operating results 
in addition  the company s operations are subject to various environmental laws and regulations dealing with the transportation  storage  presence  use  disposal and handling of hazardous materials  discharge of stormwater and underground fuel storage tanks 
if the company should be involved in a spill or other accident involving hazardous substances or if the company were found to be in violation of applicable laws or regulations  it could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
used equipment market 
swift relies on the sale of used equipment to offset the cost of purchasing new equipment 
in the past two years  used tractor values have deteriorated significantly 
should this trend continue  it could have a material adverse effect on swift s business and operating results 
claims exposure  insurance 
the company currently self insures for liability resulting from cargo loss  personal injury  workers compensation  and property damage  and maintains insurance with licensed insurance companies above its limits on self insurance 
to the extent the company were to experience an increase in the number of claims for which it is self insured  the company s operating results would be materially adversely affected 
in addition  significant increases in insurance costs  to the extent not offset by freight rate increases  would reduce the company s profitability 
dependence on key customers 
a significant portion of the company s revenue is generated from key customers 
during  the company s top  and customers accounted for  and of revenues  respectively 
the company does not have long term contractual relationships with many of its key customers  and there can be no assurance that the company s relationships with its key customers will continue as presently in effect 
a reduction in or termination of the company s services by a key customer could have a material adverse effect on the company s business and operating results 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company has interest rate exposure arising from the company s line of credit million  capital lease obligations million of and accounts receivable securitization million  all of which have variable interest rates 
these variable interest rates are impacted by changes in short term interest rates 
the company manages interest rate exposure through its mix of variable rate debt  fixed rate lease financing and million notional amount of interest rate swaps weighted average rate of 
the fair value of the company s long term debt approximates carrying values 
assuming the current level of borrowings  a hypothetical one percentage point increase in interest rates would increase the company s interest expense by million
