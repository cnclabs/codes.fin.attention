included in cash  cash equivalents and restricted cash at december  is restricted cash of  all of which was held in the argentine subsidiary 
cash held in the argentine subsidiary is considered restricted by the company due to the currency restrictions imposed by the argentine government 
working capital for the company current assets less current liabilities was  at december   versus  at december   the decline being primarily attributed to the transfer of cash to the above noted restricted cash accounts  all of which other than the cash in argentina are long term rather than short term assets see note restricted cash to the consolidated financial statements

unrestricted cash and cash equivalents were also reduced due to the transfer of  of cash to restricted cash as noted above  most of which effectively advances for planned future construction 
the cash invested in current and future construction exceeded the cash generated from operations  resulting in a decline in cash and cash equivalents of  for the year ended december   cash generated from operations and the collection of notes receivable of  and  respectively  was less than the cash invested in additions to property  plant and equipment  debt reductions and stock repurchases of   and  respectively

the company also has a  stand by letter of credit outstanding at december   which letter of credit is cash collateralized and for the benefit of the company s self insured workers compensation program 
in march  two major banks agreed to lead syndication efforts to expand the company s existing credit facility to  from the current  the facility would amend and restate the bank credit facility none of which has been drawn since february that matures december to a maturity date of approximately august  which maturity date can be extended under certain circumstances 
the facility would be used to finance the construction and opening of the lake charles casino resort  the guestroom tower at belterra casino resort and other general corporate purposes 
availability under the facility would be 
table of contents significantly limited until the company has deposited  of minimum cash proceeds from asset sales or other equity capital raising efforts into a completion reserve account 
the company expects that the source of these cash proceeds will be the two pending sales aggregating  of unimproved land adjacent to the hollywood park race track 
among the alternatives  the company could sell some or all of its surplus land in reno  st 
louis or elsewhere 
under terms of the proposed credit facility  in the event the  in cash proceeds is not deposited by march   the unfunded revolving credit commitment would be cancelled and the facility would mature on june  in addition  the facility will have customary financial covenants and capital spending restrictions  be secured by all assets of the company other than casino magic argentina and require the company to demonstrate sufficient liquidity to complete the lake charles project 
the company anticipates finalizing the proposed facility in april however  the proposed facility is subject to negotiation and execution of definitive documentation  among other conditions  and there can be no assurance the company will complete the land sales in a timely manner or be able to finalize the proposed facility under terms and conditions favorable or acceptable to the company 
the company intends to continue to maintain its current properties in good condition and estimates that this will require maintenance and miscellaneous capital spending of approximately  to  per year 
the company is also adding a guestroom hotel tower  conference and meeting facilities and a swimming pool area at its belterra casino resort at an estimated cost of approximately  including capitalized interest 
the company does not expect the pre opening costs for this project to be material

the company currently believes that  for at least the next months  its existing cash resources and cash flows from operations will be sufficient to fund operations  maintain existing properties  make necessary debt service payments and fund construction of the tower at the belterra casino resort 
the company further believes that the availability under the proposed credit facility and planned asset sales will be more than sufficient to fund the construction costs anticipated over the next months for the lake charles facility 
in october  the company s shelf registration with the securities and exchange commission became effective 
this permits the company to issue up to  of debt  equity or other securities  apart from the credit facility being expanded 
there can be no assurance  however  that the company will be able to issue any of such securities on terms acceptable to the company 
the company s selection for the fifteenth and final louisiana riverboat license is conditioned on its continued compliance with certain conditions designed to ensure that the lake charles facility is actually built and successfully opened 
in november  the gaming control board approved the project s detailed architectural plans 
on march   as required  the company submitted the project construction contracts to the gaming control board and anticipates the gaming control board will review such contracts at the regularly scheduled april meeting 
if approved  the company must demonstrate shortly thereafter that it has the resources to complete the facility to consist in part of the amended and restated bank credit facility noted above and begin construction days after the approval of the contracts 
the company must then complete the facility within months of the date that it starts construction 
management intends to continue to meet all of these conditions 
there can be no assurance  however  that all conditions will be met 
in the event that the company does not meet all these conditions  the gaming control board may opt to retract their selection of the company for the fifteenth license 

table of contents other supplemental data management believes ebitda  which the company defines as earnings before net interest expense  provision for income taxes  depreciation  amortization  minority interest  cumulative effect of change in accounting principle  and extraordinary items  to be a relevant and useful measure to compare operating results among its properties and between accounting periods 
ebitda is not a measure of financial performance under the promulgations of the accounting profession  known as generally accepted accounting principles or gaap 
ebitda is presented because it is used as a performance measure to analyze the performance of the company s business segments see note to the consolidated financial statements 
additionally  management believes some investors consider ebitda to be a useful measure in determining a company s ability to service or incur indebtedness and for estimating a company s underlying cash flow from operations before capital costs  taxes and capital expenditures

table of contents critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements were prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
certain of the accounting policies require management to apply significant judgment in defining the estimates and assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
these judgments are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
management s judgments are based on the company s historical experience  terms of various past and present agreements and contracts  industry trends  and information available from other sources  as appropriate 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
changes in these estimates could adversely impact the financial position or results of operations of the company 
the company has determined that the following accounting policies and related estimates are critical to the preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements property  plant and equipment the company has a significant investment in long lived property  plant and equipment  which represents approximately of the company s total assets 
judgments are made in determining the estimated useful lives of assets  the salvage values to be assigned to assets and if or when an asset has been impaired 
the accuracy of these estimates affects the amount of depreciation expense recognized in the financial results and whether to record a gain or loss on disposition of an asset 
the company reviews the carrying value of its property  plant and equipment whenever events or circumstances indicate that the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable from estimated future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from its use and eventual disposition 
self insurance reserves the company is self insured up to certain limits for costs associated with general liability  workers compensation and employee medical coverage 
insurance claims and reserves include accruals of estimated settlements for claims 
in estimating these accruals  the company considers historical loss experience  makes judgments about the expected levels of cost per claim and relies on independent consultants 
income tax assets and liabilities the company utilizes estimates related to cash flow projections for the application of statement of financial accounting standard no 
to the realization of deferred income tax assets 
the estimates are based upon recent operating results and budgets for future operating results

goodwill and other intangible assets which requires an annual review of goodwill and other nonamortizing intangible assets for impairment see note to the consolidated financial statements
