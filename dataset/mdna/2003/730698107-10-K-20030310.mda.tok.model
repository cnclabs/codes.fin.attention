item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations except for the historical information contained herein  certain statements in this annual report are forward looking statements as defined in the private securities litigation reform act of  which involve certain risks and uncertainties  which could cause actual results to differ materially from those discussed herein  including but not limited to competition  customer and industry concentration  depending on technological developments  risks related to expansion  dependence on key personnel  fluctuating results and seasonality and control by management 
see the relevant discussions in the company s documents filed with the securities and exchange commission  including the company s registration statement on form s as declared effective on february   and cautionary statements and risk factors in this item  for a further discussion of these and other risks and uncertainties applicable to the company s business 
overview the company s revenues are generated principally from duplication  distribution and ancillary services 
duplication services are comprised of the physical duplication of video materials from a source video or audiotape master to a target tape clone 
distribution services include the physical or electronic distribution of video and audio materials to a customer designated location utilizing one or more of the company s delivery methods 
distribution services typically consist of deliveries of national television spot commercials and electronic press kits and associated trafficking instructions to designated stations and supplemental deliveries to non broadcast destinations 
ancillary services include video and audio editing  element storage  closed captioning  transcription services  standards conversion  video encoding for air play verification  audio post production and layback and foreign language mastering 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to allowance for doubtful accounts  valuation of long lived assets  and accounting for income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results  and which require management to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgements 
critical accounting policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we have made critical estimates in the following areas allowance for doubtful accounts 
we are required to make judgments  based on historical experience and future expectations  as to the collectibility of accounts receivable 
the allowances for doubtful accounts and sales returns represent allowances for customer trade accounts receivable that are estimated to be partially or entirely uncollectible 
these allowances are used to reduce gross trade receivables to their net realizable value 
the company records these allowances based on estimates related to the following factors i customer specific allowances  ii amounts based upon an aging schedule and iii an estimated amount  based on the company s historical experience  for issues not yet identified 
valuation of long lived and intangible assets 
long lived assets  consisting primarily of property  plant and equipment and intangibles comprise a significant portion of the company s total assets 
long lived assets  including goodwill and intangibles are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances have indicated that their carrying amounts may not be recoverable 
recoverability of assets is measured by a comparison of the carrying amount of an asset to future net cash flows expected to be generated by that asset 
the cash flow projections are based on historical experience  management s view of growth rates within the industry and the anticipated future economic environment 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following o significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  o significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  o significant negative industry or economic trends  o significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and o our market capitalization relative to net book value 
when we determine that the carrying value of intangibles  long lived assets and related goodwill and enterprise level goodwill may not be recoverable based upon the existence of one or more of the above indicators of impairment  we measure any impairment based on a projected discounted cash flow method using a discount rate determined by our management to be commensurate with the risk inherent in our current business model 
net intangible assets  long lived assets  and goodwill amounted to million as of december  in  statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas became effective and as a result  we ceased to amortize approximately million of goodwill beginning in we had recorded approximately million of amortization on these amounts during the year ended december  in lieu of amortization  we were required to perform an initial impairment review of our goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the initial test on january  and the fiscal test performed as of september  required no goodwill impairment 
the discounted cash flow method used to evaluate goodwill impairment included cash flow estimates for and subsequent years 
if actual cash flow performance does not meet these expectations due to factors cited above  any resulting potential impairment could adversely affect reported goodwill asset values and earnings 
accounting for income taxes 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves us estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent we establish a valuation allowance or increase this allowance in a period  we must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining our provision for income taxes  our deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against our net deferred tax assets 
the net deferred tax liability as of december  was million 
the company did not record a valuation allowance against its deferred tax assets as of december  results of operations the following table sets forth the amount and percentage relationship to revenues of certain items included within the company s consolidated statement of income for the years ended december   and  after giving effect to the above adjustments 
the commentary below is based on these financial statements 
year ended december dollars in thousands percent percent percent of of of amount revenues amount revenues amount revenues revenues    costs of goods sold    gross profit    selling  general and administrative expense    operating income    interest expense  net    derivative fair value change provision for benefit from income taxes   income loss before extraordinary item and adoption of sab    extraordinary item net of tax benefit of cumulative effect of adopting sab net income loss    year ended december  compared to year ended december  the comments below compare results achieved in to in general  revenues were slightly lower in while costs declined and profits increased significantly 
we anticipate that revenues will increase somewhat in from we expect the relationships between revenues  gross profit and selling  general and administrative expenses in to be similar to assuming that we do not restructure our term loan in and interest rates do not change see liquidity and capital resources below  interest expense will decrease due to million of scheduled principal payments and resulting lower debt levels 
the derivative fair value change in should generate approximately million of income as the interest rate swap contract will expire in november and the theoretical value of the swap contract previously expensed is credited to income see note of notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form k 
please refer to cautionary statements and risk factors below with respect to these forward looking statements 
revenues 
revenues decreased by million or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  due to a decline in studio post production sales as some work was brought in house 
studios have traditionally maintained in house capacity and several customers utilized that capacity in to a greater extent thereby affecting our sales 
gross profit 
gross profit increased million or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a percent of revenues  gross profit increased from to 
the increase in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was principally due to lower wages and benefits as headcount was reduced since december  selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased million  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expense decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  excluding amortization of intangibles in  sg a expenses were million  or of sales for the year ended december  beginning in  the amortization of goodwill ceased as the company adopted sfas sfas changed the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives from an amortization method to an impairment only approach the procedures going forward are described in footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form k 
in connection with the adoption of sfas  the company performed a transitional goodwill impairment assessment as of january   and a second test as of september   which indicated no impairment was required 
as of december   goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  was million 
to the extent an impairment is indicated in the future by application of sfas  results of operations will be adversely affected  which effect may be material 
any impairment will not affect cash flow 
operating income 
operating income increased million or to million for  compared to million for interest expense 
interest expense decreased million  or  to million for  compared to million for because of lower debt levels due to principal payments made in adoption of sfas and derivative fair value change 
on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 disclosures about fair value of financial instruments sfas by recording a cumulative effect adjustment of  after tax benefit as a charge to shareholders equity 
during and  the company recorded the difference between the derivative fair value of the company s interest rate swap contract at the beginning and end of the periods  and amortization of the cumulative effect adjustment during the years  of million of expense and million of income  respectively 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was for and for net income loss 
the net income for was million  an increase of million compared to a loss of million for year ended december  compared to year ended december  revenues 
revenues decreased by million or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  due to a decline in studio post production sales as some work was brought in house 
studios have traditionally maintained in house capacity and several customers utilized that capacity in to a greater extent thereby affecting our sales 
gross profit 
gross profit decreased million or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a percent of revenues  gross profit decreased from to 
the decrease in gross profit as a percentage of revenues was due to increased depreciation associated with investments in high definition equipment million and higher delivery costs for distribution services million  all of which amounted to approximately of reported revenues 
the remaining decline in gross margin is due to the company s inability to cover other fixed costs with lower sales 
selling  general and administrative expense 
selling  general and administrative expense decreased million  or to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  as a percentage of revenues  selling  general and administrative expense increased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  the fiscal period included million of expenses associated with a terminated merger 
the fiscal period included million of bank agreement restructuring charges  million of employee benefit plan one time change expense  million of severance accruals  and million of consulting expense associated with the company s rebranding efforts 
excluding these items and amortization of goodwill of million in and million in  selling  general and administrative expenses were million  or of sales in compared to million  or of sales in the decrease was due principally to a million decrease in the provision for doubtful accounts 
beginning in  the amortization of goodwill ceased as the company adopted sfas sfas changes the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives from an amortization method to an impairment only approach the procedures going forward are described in footnote of notes to consolidated financial statements elsewhere in this form k 
in connection with the adoption of sfas  the company will be required to perform a transitional goodwill impairment assessment in the first half of  which may result in a write off which would be treated as a change in accounting principle 
as of december   goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  was million 
to the extent an impairment is indicated in the application of sfas  fiscal results of operations will be adversely affected  which effect may be material 
any impairment will not affect cash flow 
operating income 
operating income decreased million or to million for  compared to million for interest expense 
interest expense increased million  or  to million for  compared to million for due to a default rate of interest premium charged by the company s banks  commencing in july adoption of sfas and derivative fair value change 
on january   the company adopted sfas by recording a cumulative effect adjustment of  after tax benefit as a charge to shareholders equity 
during  the company recorded the difference between the derivative fair value of the company s interest rate swap contract at the beginning and end of the period  and amortization of the cumulative effect adjustment during the year  of million million net of tax benefit 
income taxes 
the company s effective tax rate was for and for the lower tax rate is due to the effect of permanent differences on a lower pre tax income base 
net income loss 
the net loss for was million  a decrease of million compared to a profit of million for liquidity and capital resources this discussion should be read in conjunction with the notes to the financial statements and the corresponding information more fully described in the company s form k for the year ended december  on december   the company s cash and cash equivalents aggregated million 
the company s operating activities provided cash of million for the year ended december  the company s investing activities used cash of million in the year ended december  the company spent approximately million for the addition and replacement of capital equipment and management information systems which we believe is a reasonable capital expenditure level given the current revenue volume 
in the prior years  the company s capital expenditures were greater than a normal recurring amount partially due to the investment of approximately million in high definition post production equipment 
the company s business is equipment intensive  requiring periodic expenditures of cash or the incurrence of additional debt to acquire additional fixed assets in order to increase capacity or replace existing equipment 
we estimate that capital expenditures will be to million in in september  the company signed a million revolving credit facility agented by union bank of california 
the amount of the commitment was reduced to million in july the facility provided the company with funding for capital expenditures  working capital needs and support for its acquisition strategies 
due to lower sales levels in the second and third quarters of fiscal  the borrowing base eligible accounts receivable  inventory and machinery and equipment securing the company s bank line of credit was less than the amount borrowed under the line 
consequently  the company was in breach of certain covenants 
on june and on july   the company entered into amendment and forbearance agreements with the banks and agreed to repay the overdraft amount in weekly increments 
in august  the company failed to meet the repayment schedule and again entered discussions with the banks 
in may  the company and the banks entered into a restructured loan agreement changing the revolving credit facility to a term loan  with all existing defaults being waived 
the term loan has a maturity date of december  pursuant to the agreement  the company made million in scheduled principal payments in and will make additional principal payments of million and million in and  respectively 
the agreement provides for interest at the banks reference rate plus and requires the company to maintain certain financial covenant ratios 
the term loan is secured by substantially all of the company s assets 
in july  we entered into an arrangement regarding earn out payments related to the july acquisition of multimedia services  inc the original acquisition agreement would have required payments of approximately million during the next two years assuming minimum earnings levels are met  which levels have been achieved in the past 
in exchange for a one time million payment made in july  we were relieved of all future earn out obligations under the purchase agreement 
in october  the company paid the banks  and made an additional principal payment of  in connection with a waiver received from the banks to allow the company s former president and chief executive officer to reduce his percentage ownership in the company to below the required in the restructured loan agreement 
during the past year  the company has generated sufficient cash to meet operating  capital expenditure and debt service needs and obligations  as well as to provide sufficient cash reserves to address contingencies 
when preparing estimates of future cash flows  we consider historical performance  technological changes  market factors  industry trends and other criteria 
in our opinion  the company will continue to be able to fund its needs for the foreseeable future 
the company  from time to time  considers the acquisition of businesses complementary to its current operations 
consummation of any such acquisition or other expansion of the business conducted by the company may be subject to the company securing additional financing 
for example  on july   we entered into an option agreement to acquire three subsidiaries of alliance atlantis communications inc aaci 
if we exercise the option and acquire the entities  we will have to finance a large portion of the million anticipated purchase price and refinance our existing million term loan 
the cost of new financing is expected to be higher than our existing term loan 
future earnings and cash flow may be negatively impacted to the extent the acquired entities do not generate sufficient earnings and cash flow to offset the increased costs

we wish to caution you not to place undue reliance on any such forward looking statements  which speak only as of the date made 
in connection with the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we are calling to your attention important factors that could affect our financial performance and could cause actual results for future periods to differ materially from any opinions or statements expressed with respect to future periods in any current statements 
the following list of important factors may not be all inclusive  and we specifically decline to undertake an obligation to publicly revise any forward looking statements that have been made to reflect events or circumstances after the date of such statements or to reflect the occurrence of anticipated or unanticipated events 
among the factors that could have an impact on our ability to achieve expected operating results and growth plan goals and or affect the market price of our stock are o recent history of losses o prior breach of credit agreement covenants and new principal payment requirements 
o our highly competitive marketplace 
o the risks associated with dependence upon significant customers 
o our ability to execute our expansion strategy 
o the uncertain ability to manage growth 
o our dependence upon and our ability to adapt to technological developments 
o dependence on key personnel 
o our ability to maintain and improve service quality 
o fluctuation in quarterly operating results and seasonality in certain of our markets 
o possible significant influence over corporate affairs by significant shareholders 
these risk factors are discussed further below 
recent history of losses 
the company has reported losses for each of the five fiscal quarters ended december  due  in part  to lower gross margins and lower sales levels and a number of unusual charges 
although we achieved profitability in fiscal and prior years  as well as in the four fiscal quarters ended december   there can be no assurance as to future profitability on a quarterly or annual basis 
prior breach of credit agreement covenants and new principal payment requirements 
due to lower operating cash amounts resulting from reduced sales levels in and the consequential net losses  the company breached certain covenants of its credit facility 
the breaches were temporarily cured based on amendments and forbearance agreements among the company and the banks which called for  among other provisions  scheduled payments to reduce amounts owed to the banks to the permitted borrowing base 
in august  the company failed to meet the principal repayment schedule and was once again in breach of the credit facility 
the banks ended their formal commitment to the company in december in may  we entered into an agreement with the banks to restructure the credit facility to a term loan maturing on december  as part of this restructuring  the banks waived all existing defaults and the company made principal payments of million in  and will make principal payments of million and million in  and  respectively 
based upon the company s financial forecast  the company will have to refinance the facility by to satisfy the final payment requirement 
competition 
our broadcast video post production  duplication and distribution industry is a highly competitive  service oriented business 
in general  we do not have long term or exclusive service agreements with our customers 
business is acquired on a purchase order basis and is based primarily on customer satisfaction with reliability  timeliness  quality and price 
we compete with a variety of post production  duplication and distribution firms  some of which have a national presence  and to a lesser extent  the in house post production and distribution operations of our major motion picture studio and advertising agency customers 
some of these firms  and all of the studios  have greater financial  distribution and marketing resources and have achieved a higher level of brand recognition than the company 
in the future  we may not be able to compete effectively against these competitors merely on the basis of reliability  timeliness  quality and price or otherwise 
we may also face competition from companies in related markets which could offer similar or superior services to those offered by the company 
we believe that an increasingly competitive environment and the possibility that customers may utilize in house capabilities to a greater extent could lead to a loss of market share or price reductions  which could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
customer and industry concentration 
although we have an active client list of over  customers  seven motion picture studios accounted for approximately of the company s revenues during the year ended december  if one or more of these companies were to stop using our services  our business could be adversely affected 
because we derive substantially all of our revenue from clients in the entertainment and advertising industries  the financial condition  results of operations and prospects of the company could also be adversely affected by an adverse change in conditions which impact those industries 
expansion strategy 
our growth strategy involves both internal development and expansion through acquisitions 
we currently have no agreements or commitments to acquire any company or business other than an option to acquire three facilities from alliance atlantis communications inc even though we have completed eight acquisitions in the last five fiscal years  we cannot be sure additional acceptable acquisitions will be available or that we will be able to reach mutually agreeable terms to purchase acquisition targets  or that we will be able to profitably manage additional businesses or successfully integrate such additional businesses into the company without substantial costs  delays or other problems 
certain of the businesses previously acquired by the company reported net losses for their most recent fiscal years prior to being acquired  and our future financial performance will be in part dependent on our ability to implement operational improvements in  or exploit potential synergies with  these acquired businesses 
acquisitions may involve a number of special risks including adverse effects on our reported operating results including the amortization of acquired intangible assets  diversion of management s attention and unanticipated problems or legal liabilities 
in addition  we may require additional funding to finance future acquisitions 
we cannot be sure that we will be able to secure acquisition financing on acceptable terms or at all 
we may also use working capital or equity  or raise financing through equity offerings or the incurrence of debt  in connection with the funding of any acquisition 
some or all of these risks could negatively affect our financial condition  results of operations and prospects or could result in dilution to the company s shareholders 
in addition  to the extent that consolidation becomes more prevalent in the industry  the prices for attractive acquisition candidates could increase substantially 
we may not be able to effect any such transactions 
additionally  if we are able to complete such transactions they may prove to be unprofitable 
the geographic expansion of the company s customers may result in increased demand for services in certain regions where it currently does not have post production  duplication and distribution facilities 
to meet this demand  we may subcontract 
however  we have not entered into any formal negotiations or definitive agreements for this purpose 
furthermore  we cannot assure you that we will be able to effect such transactions or that any such transactions will prove to be profitable 
in july  the company issued a warrant to purchase  shares of the company s common stock to aaci in consideration of an option to purchase three post production facilities owned by aaci 
in connection therewith  the company capitalized the fair value of the warrant  determined by using the black scholes valuation model 
in december  the option was extended by mutual agreement and we deposited  toward the ultimate purchase price  which was negotiated downward 
in the event the company does not exercise its option by the option termination date march  or any extension thereof  these amounts will be written off 
although such a write off would represent a non cash charge to income  we cannot predict the effect of such a charge on the market price of our common stock  if any 
management of growth 
during the three years ended december   we experienced rapid growth that resulted in new and increased responsibilities for management personnel and placed and continues to place increased demands on our management  operational and financial systems and resources 
to accommodate this growth  compete effectively and manage future growth  we will be required to continue to implement and improve our operational  financial and management information systems  and to expand  train  motivate and manage our work force 
we cannot be sure that the company s personnel  systems  procedures and controls will be adequate to support our future operations 
any failure to do so could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
dependence on technological developments 
although we intend to utilize the most efficient and cost effective technologies available for telecine  high definition formatting  editing  coloration and delivery of video content  including digital satellite transmission  as they develop  we cannot be sure that we will be able to adapt to such standards in a timely fashion or at all 
we believe our future growth will depend in part  on our ability to add to these services and to add customers in a timely and cost effective manner 
we cannot be sure we will be successful in offering such services to existing customers or in obtaining new customers for these services  including the company s significant investment in high definition technology in and we intend to rely on third party vendors for the development of these technologies and there is no assurance that such vendors will be able to develop such technologies in a manner that meets the needs of the company and its customers 
any material interruption in the supply of such services could materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
dependence on key personnel 
the company is dependent on the efforts and abilities of certain of its senior management  particularly those of haig s 
bagerdjian  chairman  president and chief executive officer 
the loss or interruption of the services of key members of management could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects if a suitable replacement is not promptly obtained 
mr 
bagerdjian owns approximately of the company s outstanding stock  but does not have an employment contract 
although we have employment agreements with certain of our other key executives  we cannot be sure that either mr 
bagerdjian or other executives will remain with the company 
in addition  our success depends to a significant degree upon the continuing contributions of  and on our ability to attract and retain  qualified management  sales  operations  marketing and technical personnel 
the competition for qualified personnel is intense and the loss of any such persons  as well as the failure to recruit additional key personnel in a timely manner  could have a material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
there is no assurance that we will be able to continue to attract and retain qualified management and other personnel for the development of our business 
ability to maintain and improve service quality 
our business is dependent on our ability to meet the current and future demands of our customers  which demands include reliability  timeliness  quality and price 
any failure to do so  whether or not caused by factors within our control could result in losses to such clients 
although we disclaim any liability for such losses  there is no assurance that claims would not be asserted or that dissatisfied customers would refuse to make further deliveries through the company in the event of a significant occurrence of lost deliveries  either of which could have material adverse effect on our financial condition  results of operations and prospects 
although we maintain insurance against business interruption  such insurance may not be adequate to protect the company from significant loss in these circumstances and there is no assurance that a major catastrophe such as an earthquake or other natural disaster would not result in a prolonged interruption of our business 
in addition  our ability to make deliveries within the time periods requested by customers depends on a number of factors  some of which are outside of our control  including equipment failure  work stoppages by package delivery vendors or interruption in services by telephone or satellite service providers 
fluctuating results  seasonality 
our operating results have varied in the past  and may vary in the future  depending on factors such as the volume of advertising in response to seasonal buying patterns  the timing of new product and service introductions  the timing of revenue recognition upon the completion of longer term projects  increased competition  timing of acquisitions  general economic factors and other factors 
as a result  we believe that period to period comparisons of our results of operations are not necessarily meaningful and should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance 
for example  our operating results have historically been significantly influenced by the volume of business from the motion picture industry  which is an industry that is subject to seasonal and cyclical downturns  and  occasionally  work stoppages by actors  writers and others 
in addition  as our business from advertising agencies tends to be seasonal  our operating results may be subject to increased seasonality as the percentage of business from advertising agencies increases 
in any period our revenues are subject to variation based on changes in the volume and mix of services performed during the period 
it is possible that in some future quarter the company s operating results will be below the expectations of equity research analysts and investors 
in such event  the price of the company s common stock would likely be materially adversely affected 
fluctuations in sales due to seasonality may become more pronounced if the growth rate of the company s sales slows
