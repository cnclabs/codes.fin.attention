item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion and analysis should be read in conjunction with the selected financial data and the company s consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere herein 
critical accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations discusses the company s consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the preparation of these financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
management continually evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
management bases its estimates and assumptions on historical information and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from these estimates 
management believes the following critical accounting policies affect the more significant assumptions and estimates used in the preparation of its consolidated financial statements the carrying value of the company s goodwill and television station licenses is tested for impairment in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
if an impairment test indicates that the carrying value of goodwill is impaired  the carrying value of goodwill is reduced by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the implied fair value of that goodwill 
if an impairment test indicates that the carrying value of the television station licenses is impaired  the carrying value of the television station licenses is reduced by the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the television station licenses 
both the implied fair value of goodwill and the fair value of the television station licenses are based upon assumptions which may prove to be untrue in the future 
the company records a valuation allowance to reduce its net deferred tax assets to the amount that is more likely than not to be realized 
while management has considered future taxable income and ongoing prudent and feasible tax planning strategies in assessing the need for its valuation allowance  in the event the company were to determine that it would be able to realize its deferred tax assets in the future in an amount in excess of the net recorded amount  an adjustment to the valuation allowance would decrease income tax expense in the period such determination was made 
likewise  should the company determine that it would not be able to realize all or part of its net deferred tax assets in the future  an adjustment to its valuation allowance would increase income tax expense in the period such determination was made
