item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations our management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains certain forward looking statements that involve risks and uncertainties  including statements regarding our strategy  financial performance and revenue sources 
we use words such as anticipate  believe  plan  expect  future  intend and similar expressions to identify forward looking statements 
our actual results could differ materially from the results anticipated in these forward looking statements as a result of certain factors including those set forth in this item  and under item business additional factors that may affect results of operations  beginning at page  above  and elsewhere in this form k 
although we believe that the expectations reflected in the forward looking statements are reasonable  we cannot guarantee future results  levels of activity  performance or achievements 
you should not place undue reliance on these forward looking statements 
we disclaim any obligation to update information contained in any forward looking statement 
on january   we merged with telcom and accounted for the merger as a pooling of interests 
accordingly  our consolidated financial statements have been restated to include the operations of telcom for all periods presented 
telcom had a december fiscal year end  thus the consolidated financial statements presented for march  and have been combined with the operations of telcom as of and for the years ended december  and we have conformed the telcom financial data to a march year end for the march  fiscal year 
recent development on april   we announced our intention to close our chandler  arizona fab wafer fabrication facility and integrate certain fab personnel and processes into our tempe  arizona fab wafer fabrication facility 
this decision was made as a result of days of inventory at march  reaching days  increasing from days at december  this increase in inventory reflects the lower demand for our products that we experienced in the march quarter 
we made the decision to close fab in order to better align our production capacity to current demand requirements 
this decision making process included a review of our capacity including the forthcoming start up of our gresham oregon fab wafer fabrication facility which is required to produce our more advanced products 
we expect to complete the integration process during the quarter ending june   after which fab will cease to operate as a wafer fabrication facility 
the closure of fab and the integration of certain fab personnel into fab operations will result in a reduction in force of approximately employees 
we expect that  in the first quarter of fiscal  we will incur accelerated depreciation charges and other expenses related to the shut down of fab of between million and million 
change in accounting principle we have historically recognized revenue from sales to our americas  european and multinational asian distributors at point of sale pos  or when those distributors sell our products to their customers  and prior to fiscal we recognized revenue on sales to regional asian distributors at point of purchase pop  or when we shipped product to these distributors 
upon shipment  amounts billed to distributors at pos are included as accounts receivable  inventory is relieved  the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributor to its customers 
on march   we announced that we would change our revenue recognition policy relating to regional asian distributors from pop to pos 
we believe that revenue recognition at pos for sales to distributors as our sole revenue recognition policy worldwide is a more reflective measure of end customer demand for our products 
to implement the change in revenue recognition  we recorded the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle of million net of income taxes of million as of april   the beginning of fiscal the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle was calculated by multiplying the quantity of our inventory that the regional asia distributors maintained as of april  by the gross margin we would realize on those sales  net of related income tax 
we restated our quarterly results for fiscal to conform to the change in accounting principle and have included at note of our consolidated financial statements a comparative table of our earnings for the first three quarters of fiscal with and without the change in accounting principle 
the restatement of the first three quarters of fiscal resulted in a cumulative reduction in revenue of approximately million and a cumulative reduction in net income of approximately million or 
per share 
critical accounting policies and estimates general our discussion and analysis of microchip s financial condition and results of operations is based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
we review the accounting policies we use in reporting our financial results on a regular basis 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue recognition  inventories  income taxes  property plant and equipment  litigation and impairment of property  plant and equipment and assets held for sale 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
results may differ from these estimates due to actual outcomes being different from those on which we based our assumptions 
we review these estimates and judgments on an ongoing basis 
we believe the following critical accounting policies affect our more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of our consolidated financial statements 
revenue recognition we recognize revenue from product sales upon shipment to oems 
for sales recorded upon shipment  we record reserves to cover the estimated customer returns 
returns have historically been less than of sales 
to the extent rates of return change  our estimates for the reserves necessary to cover such returns would also change 
our distributors have broad rights to return products and price protection rights  so we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to their customers 
upon shipment  amounts billed to distributors are included as accounts receivable  inventory is relieved  the sale is deferred and the gross margin is reflected as a current liability until the product is sold by the distributor to their customers 
we changed our revenue recognition policy as it relates to sales to asia regional distributors during fiscal as described above at page and in note to our consolidated financial statements 
inventories inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market using the first in  first out fifo method 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory in an amount equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated market value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those we projected are  additional inventory write downs may be required 
inventory impairment charges establish a new cost basis for inventory and charges are not subsequently reversed to income even if circumstances later suggest that increased carrying amounts are recoverable 
in estimating our reserves for obsolescence  we generally evaluate estimates of demand over a month period which is based on the most recent quarter multiplied by four and provide reserves for inventory on hand in excess of the estimated month demand 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that it is more likely than not that our deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
at march   our gross deferred tax asset was million 
numerous taxing authorities in the countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by businesses 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset the potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in these countries 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than the ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense would result 
the foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax asset and the adequacy of our tax reserves are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others results of any audit conducted by the various taxing authorities in the countries in which we do business  the level of our taxable income and whether our taxable income will be sufficient to realize the benefits available from our deferred tax assets  current and future tax laws and regulations  and taxation rates in geographic regions where we have significant operations 
property plant equipment property  plant and equipment are stated at cost 
major renewals and improvements are capitalized  while maintenance and repairs are expensed when incurred 
at march   the carrying value of our property and equipment totaled million  which represents of our total assets 
this carrying value reflects the application of our property and equipment accounting policies  which incorporate estimates  assumptions and judgements relative to the useful lives of our property and equipment 
depreciation is provided on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of the related assets  which range from five to seven years on manufacturing equipment and approximately years on buildings 
fab has not been placed in service and the related depreciation of the assets at fab has not commenced 
the lives to be used for depreciating the equipment at fab will be evaluated at such time as the assets are placed in service 
we do not believe that the temporary idling of such assets has impaired the estimated life or values of the underlying assets 
in april  we announced our intention to close fab and integrate certain fab personnel and processes into fab we expect to complete the integration process during the quarter ended june   after which fab will cease to operate as a wafer fabrication facility 
the closure of fab and the integration of certain fab personnel into fab operations will result in a reduction in force of approximately employees 
we expect that  in the first quarter of fiscal  we will incur accelerated depreciation charges on the underlying assets and other expenses related to the shut down of fab the estimates  assumptions and judgments we use in the application of our property and equipment policies reflect both historical experience and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations 
the use of different estimates  assumptions and judgments regarding the useful lives of our property and equipment and expectations regarding future industry conditions and operations  would likely result in materially different carrying values of assets and results of operations 
we do not currently hold title to the land on which our thailand facility resides 
the land is subject to a complex restructuring situation relating to the seller of the land 
we have provided reserves that we estimate will be adequate to obtain full title 
such reserves are set at the estimated fair value of the land 
however  timing of the resolution and the ultimate amount to be paid could change 
litigation our current estimated range of liability related to certain pending litigation is based on the probable loss of claims for which we can estimate the amount and range of loss  and recorded reserves were not significant at march because of the uncertainties related to both the probability of loss and the amount and range of loss on the remaining pending litigation  we are unable to make a reasonable estimate of the liability that could result from an unfavorable outcome 
as additional information becomes available  we will assess the potential liability related to our pending litigation and revise our estimates 
revisions in our estimates of the potential liability could materially impact our results of operation and financial position 
impairment of property  plant and equipment and assets held for sale we assess whether indicators of impairment of long lived assets are present 
if such indicators are present  we determine whether the sum of the estimated undiscounted cash flows attributable to the assets in question is less than their carrying value 
if less  we recognize an impairment loss based on the excess of the carrying amount of the assets over their respective fair values 
fair value is determined by discounted future cash flows  appraisals or other methods 
if the assets determined to be impaired are to be held and used  we recognize an impairment loss through a charge to our operating results to the extent the present value of anticipated net cash flows attributable to the asset are less than the asset s carrying value  which we depreciate over the remaining estimated useful life of the asset 
we may incur impairment losses  or additional losses on already impaired assets  in future periods if factors influencing our estimates change 
results of operations the following table sets forth certain operational data as a percentage of net sales for the years indicated year ended march  net sales cost of sales gross profit research and development selling  general and administrative special charges operating income net sales we operate in one industry segment and engage primarily in the design  development  manufacture and marketing of semiconductor products 
we sell our products to distributors and oems in a broad range of market segments  perform on going credit evaluations of our customers and generally require no collateral 
our net sales of million in fiscal increased by million  or  over fiscal  and net sales of million in fiscal decreased by million  or  over fiscal the increase in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from increased demand  predominantly for our proprietary microcontroller and analog and interface products 
the decrease in net sales in fiscal compared to fiscal resulted primarily from slowing demand from end markets  and to a lesser extent from inventory corrections at our customers  overall semiconductor industry conditions and serial eeprom pricing declines 
we believe that we have continued to grow our percentage of market share in the embedded control market over the last three fiscal years 
key factors that have driven our net sales performance during the last three fiscal years include o continued market share gains o increasing semiconductor content in our customers products o our new product offerings that have increased our served available market  and o increasing demand for our programmable products 
sales by product line for the fiscal years ended march   and were as follows dollars in thousands year ended march  microcontrollers    memory products    analog and interface products 
   total sales    certain reclassifications have been made to conform the prior period amounts to the current period presentation 
microcontrollers our microcontroller product line represents the largest component of our total net sales 
microcontrollers and associated application development systems accounted for approximately of our total net sales in fiscal  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal and approximately of our total net sales in fiscal net sales of our microcontroller products increased approximately in fiscal  compared to fiscal the increase in net sales was primarily due to increased demand for our microcontroller products in end markets  driven principally by market share gains and those factors described above under net sales at page the end markets that we serve include the automotive  communications  computing  consumer and industrial control markets 
during fiscal the semiconductor industry experienced significant demand reductions based on overall market conditions 
net sales of our microcontroller products decreased approximately in fiscal  compared to fiscal the decrease in net sales of our microcontroller products was significantly lower than the decrease in our other product lines  due primarily to our continuing design win performance and the overall positioning of our proprietary product offerings 
historically  average selling prices in the semiconductor industry decrease over the life of any particular product 
the overall average selling prices of our microcontroller products have remained relatively constant over time due to the proprietary nature of these products 
we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  moderate pricing pressure in certain microcontroller product lines  primarily due to competitive conditions 
we have been able to in the past  and expect to be able to in the future  moderate average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines by introducing new products with more features and higher prices 
we may be unable to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future  which would adversely affect our operating results 
memory products sales of our memory products accounted for approximately of our total net sales in fiscal  approximately of our total net sales in fiscal and approximately of our total net sales in fiscal net sales of our memory products increased approximately in fiscal  compared to fiscal  driven primarily by customer demand conditions within the serial eeprom market  which products comprise substantially all of our memory product net sales 
net sales of our memory products decreased by approximately in fiscal  compared to fiscal  driven by over supply in the market and significant pricing pressures 
serial eeprom product pricing has historically been cyclical in nature  with steep price declines followed by periods of relative price stability  driven by changes in industry capacity at different stages of the business cycle 
during the past three fiscal years  we have experienced several serial eeprom product pricing trends due to market conditions 
in fiscal we experienced product pricing increases due to supply constraints within the market 
we experienced significant competitive downward pricing pressures in our serial eeprom product lines during the first half of fiscal  returning to modest pricing declines in the second half of fiscal we experienced modest pricing declines in our serial eeprom product lines during fiscal compared to fiscal we have experienced  and expect to continue to experience  varying degrees of competitive pricing pressures in our serial eeprom products 
we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our serial eeprom products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future  which would adversely affect our operating results 
analog and interface products sales of our analog and interface products accounted for approximately of our total net sales in fiscal and fiscal and approximately of our total net sales in fiscal net sales of our analog and interface products increased approximately in fiscal  compared to fiscal driven primarily by new proprietary design wins  supply and demand conditions within the market and our ability to gain market share 
net sales of our analog and interface products decreased approximately in fiscal  compared to fiscal as a result of decreased demand  primarily in the telecommunications market 
analog and interface products can be proprietary or non proprietary in nature 
currently  we consider approximately of our analog and interface product mix to be proprietary in nature  where prices are relatively stable  similar to the pricing stability experienced in our microcontroller products 
the non proprietary portion of our analog and interface business will experience price fluctuations  driven primarily by the current supply and demand for those products 
during fiscal  pricing of our non proprietary analog and interface products was approximately flat compared to fiscal during fiscal  our analog and interface products experienced price reductions of approximately compared to fiscal the price decreases experienced in fiscal can be primarily attributed to the supply and demand environment and the integration of the telcom products into our pricing structure 
we may be unable to maintain the average selling prices of our analog and interface products as a result of increased pricing pressure in the future  which would adversely affect our operating results 
we anticipate the proprietary portion of our analog and interface products to increase over time 
turns orders our net sales in any given quarter depend upon a combination of shipments from backlog and orders received in that quarter for shipment in that quarter  which we refer to as turns orders 
we measure turns orders at the beginning of a quarter based on the orders needed to meet the revenue target that we set entering the quarter 
we emphasize our ability to respond quickly to customer orders as part of our competitive strategy  resulting in customers placing orders with short delivery schedules 
turns orders directly correlate to product lead times  which are generally three weeks or less for the majority of our products  essentially unchanged from lead times a year ago 
shorter lead times generally mean that turns orders as a percentage of our business are relatively high in any particular quarter and reduces our visibility on future product shipments 
with current lead times for the majority of our products being three weeks or less  generally  customers do not place orders beyond their immediate requirements 
the percentage of turns orders in any given quarter is dependent on overall semiconductor industry conditions and product lead times 
as such  our percentage of turns orders required in any particular quarter has fluctuated over the last three fiscal years between and 
during fiscal our turns orders were at the high end of this range 
turns orders are difficult to predict  and we may not experience the combination of turns orders and shipments from backlog in a quarter that would be sufficient to achieve anticipated net sales 
if we do not achieve a sufficient level of turns orders in a particular quarter  our net sales and operating results will suffer 
the foregoing statements regarding competitive pricing pressure in our microcontroller  serial eeprom and analog and interface product lines  our ability to moderate future average selling price declines in our microcontroller product lines and the proprietary portion of our analog and interface product lines increasing over time are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others the level of orders that are received and can be shipped in a quarter  changes in demand for our products and the products of our customers  the level and timing at which previous design wins become actual orders and sales  inventory mix and timing of customer orders  customers inventory levels  order patterns and seasonality  level of sell through of our products through distribution in any particular fiscal period  our ability to ramp products into volume production  competition and competitive pressures on pricing and product availability  disruptions in commercial activities  or international transport or delivery occasioned by terrorist activity  armed conflict  war or an unexpected increase in the price of  or decrease in the supply of  oil resulting in reduced end user purchases relative to expectations  impact of events outside the united states  such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products  market acceptance of our new products and those of our customers  the financial condition of our customers  fluctuations in production yields  production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization  changes in product mix  absorption of fixed costs  labor and other fixed manufacturing costs  and general industry  economic and political conditions 
distribution distributors accounted for of our net sales in fiscal  of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal our largest distributor accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  of our net sales in fiscal and of our net sales in fiscal generally  we do not have long term agreements with our distributors and we  or our distributors  may terminate their relationships with us with little or no advanced notice 
the loss of  or the disruption in the operations of  one or more of our distributors could reduce our future net sales in a given quarter and could result in an increase in inventory returns 
at march   distributors were maintaining an average of approximately months of inventory of our products 
over the past three fiscal years  the months of inventory maintained by our distributors have fluctuated between approximately and months 
while inventory levels at our distributors are at the low end of the range we have experienced over the last three years  we would not anticipate any significant change in inventory holding patterns until lead times for our products  and the industry generally  extend beyond the current levels 
as we recognize revenue based on sell through for all of our distributors  we do not believe that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will impact our net sales 
the foregoing statements regarding our anticipation that distributor inventory holding patterns will not significantly change until lead times for our products  and the industry in general  extend beyond the current levels and our belief that inventory holding patterns at our distributors will not impact our net sales are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others the rate of recovery in the overall economy and the uncertainty of current economic and political conditions  changes in demand for our products and the products of our customers  the level and timing at which previous design wins become actual orders and sales  inventory mix and timing of customer orders  customers inventory levels  order patterns and seasonality  the impact on our business and customer order patterns due to major public health concern  such as the spread of the sars virus  level of sell through of our products through distribution in any particular fiscal period  disruptions in commercial activities  or international transport or delivery occasioned by terrorist activity  armed conflict  war or an unexpected increase in the price of  or decrease in the supply of  oil resulting in reduced end user purchases relative to expectations  impact of events outside the united states  such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability  the cyclical nature of both the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products  market acceptance of our new products and those of our customers  and the financial condition of our customers 
sales by geography sales by geography for the fiscal years ended march   and were as follows dollars in thousands year ended march  americas    europe    asia    total sales    our sales to foreign customers have been predominately in asia and europe  which we attribute to the manufacturing strength in those areas for automotive  communications  computing  consumer and industrial control products 
americas sales include sales to customers in the united states  canada  central america and south america 
sales to foreign customers accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal  approximately of our net sales in fiscal and approximately of our net sales in each of fiscal the majority of our foreign sales are us dollar denominated 
sales to customers in china accounted for approximately of our net sales in fiscal we did not have sales into any other countries that exceeded of our net sales during the periods covered by this report 
gross profit our gross profit was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal gross profit as a percent of sales was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal the most significant factors affecting gross profit percentage over the past three fiscal years were o higher levels of manufacturing capacity utilization in fiscal  compared to fiscal o reduced levels of manufacturing capacity utilization in fiscal  compared to fiscal o continued cost reductions in wafer fabrication and assembly and test manufacturing o our ability to maintain average selling prices for our microcontroller products where moderate downward pricing pressures have been offset by introduction of new products with more features and higher selling prices o varying positive and negative factors impacting the average selling prices of our serial eeprom products o fluctuations in the product mix of proprietary microcontroller and analog products and related serial eeprom products o the sale of inventory that was previously reserved for  and o one week plant shutdowns in each quarter of fiscal by march   we reduced cumulative wafer capacity at fab and fab by approximately  compared to our december  levels  in response to business conditions that resulted in decreased product demand 
during fiscal  we operated at approximately of our cumulative total fab and fab capacity due to the capacity reductions implemented in the march quarter and one week plant shutdowns in each quarter of fiscal our overall gross margins in fiscal were negatively impacted by these actions due to the relatively high fixed costs inherent in our wafer fabrication manufacturing 
during fiscal  we operated at approximately of our cumulative total fab and fab capacity  which favorably impacted gross margins  compared to fiscal the process technologies utilized and the size of the wafers on which our products are produced impact our gross margins 
fabs and currently utilize various manufacturing process technologies  but predominantly utilize our to micron processes 
we continue to transition products to more advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs 
in fiscal and fiscal  approximately of our production was on inch wafers 
in fiscal  approximately of our production was on inch wafers 
all of our production will be on inch wafers once the fab personnel and processes are integrated into fab our overall inventory levels were million at march   compared to million at march  and million at march  we had days of inventory on our balance sheet at march   compared to days at march  and days at march  see item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations recent development  beginning at page above  for a discussion of our anticipated actions related to our overall inventory levels 
we anticipate that our gross margins will fluctuate over time  driven primarily by the overall product mix of microcontroller  analog and interface and memory products and the percentage of net sales of each of these products in a particular quarter  as well as manufacturing yields  fixed cost absorption  wafer fab loading levels and competitive and economic conditions 
the foregoing statements relating to our transition to advanced process technologies to reduce future manufacturing costs and the fluctuation of gross margins over time are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others changes in demand for our products and the products of our customers  fluctuations in production yields  production efficiencies and overall capacity utilization  changes in capacity utilization  absorption of fixed costs  labor and other direct manufacturing costs  competition and competitive pressure on pricing  disruptions in commercial activities  or international transport or delivery occasioned by terrorist activity  armed conflict  war or an unexpected increase in the price of  or decrease in the supply of  oil resulting in reduced end user purchases relative to expectations  impact of events outside the united states  such as the business impact of fluctuating currency rates or unrest or political instability  our ability to increase manufacturing capacity as needed  cost and availability of raw materials  changes in product mix  and other general industry  economic and political conditions 
at march   approximately of our assembly requirements were being performed in our thailand facility  compared to approximately as of march  third party contractors located throughout asia perform the balance of our assembly operations 
substantially all of our test requirements were being performed in our thailand facility as of march  and march  we believe that the assembly and test operations performed at our thailand facility provide us with significant cost savings when compared to third party contractor assembly and test costs  as well as increased control over these portions of the manufacturing process 
our use of third parties involves some reduction in our level of control over the portions of our business that we subcontract 
while we review the quality  delivery and cost performance of our third party contractors  our future operating results could suffer if any third party contractor is unable to maintain manufacturing yields  assembly and test yields and costs at approximately their current levels 
research and development r d r d expenses for fiscal were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal  and million  or of sales  for fiscal we are committed to investing in new and enhanced products  including development systems software  and in our design and manufacturing process technologies 
we believe these investments are significant factors in maintaining our competitive position 
we expense all r d costs as incurred 
r d expenses include expenditures for labor  depreciation  masks  prototype wafers  and expenses for the development of process technologies  new packages  and software to support new products and design environments 
r d expenses increased million  or  for fiscal over fiscal r d expenses increased million  or  for fiscal over fiscal the primary reason for the dollar increase in r d costs in fiscal over fiscal and fiscal was increased labor and professional service costs associated with expanding our technical resources and the ongoing r d expenses acquired as part of the acquisition of powersmart  inc described at special charges fiscal powersmart in process research and development charge  below at page r d expenses would have been higher in fiscal if we had not implemented unpaid one week shutdowns in each of the first two quarters of fiscal selling  general and administrative selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal were million  or of sales  compared to million  or of sales  for fiscal and million  or of sales  for fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses include salary expenses related to field sales  marketing and administrative personnel  advertising and promotional expenditures and legal expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses also include costs related to our direct sales force and field applications engineers who work in sales offices worldwide to stimulate demand by assisting customers in the selection and use of our products 
selling  general and administrative expenses increased million  or  for fiscal over fiscal the primary reason for the dollar increase in selling  general and administrative costs in fiscal over fiscal relate to increased labor costs due to increases in headcount  salaries and bonuses 
selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  for fiscal over fiscal  primarily due to reductions in wages  bonuses and recruitment costs and unpaid one week shutdowns in each of the first two quarters of fiscal selling  general and administrative expenses fluctuate over time  primarily due to revenue and operating expense levels 
special charges the following table presents a summary of special charges for the fiscal years ended march   and year ended march  in thousands fab impairment charge  in process research development charge  restructuring charges  telcom merger charges  totals   fiscal fab impairment charge in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which is applicable to financial statements for fiscal years beginning after december  sfas provides a single accounting model for long lived assets to be disposed of and significantly changes the criteria that must be met to classify an asset as held for sale 
classification as held for sale is an important distinction because assets held for sale are not depreciated and are stated at the lower of book value or fair value less cost to sell 
sfas is effective for all of our financial statements issued subsequent to april  in accordance with sfas  we recorded a million asset impairment charge during the quarter ended september   as described below 
we acquired fab  a semiconductor manufacturing facility in puyallup  washington  in july the original purchase consisted of semiconductor manufacturing facilities and real property 
it was our intention to bring fab to productive readiness and commence volume production of inch wafers using our and micron process technologies by august we delayed our production start up at fab due to deteriorating business conditions in the semiconductor industry during fiscal fab has never been brought to productive readiness 
on august   we acquired fab  a semiconductor manufacturing facility in gresham  oregon 
see note to the consolidated financial statements on page f  below 
we decided to purchase fab instead of bringing fab to productive readiness because  among other things  the cost of the manufacturing equipment needed to ramp production at fab over the next several years was significantly higher than the total purchase price of fab  and the time to bring fab to productive readiness was significantly less than the time required to bring fab to productive readiness 
after the acquisition of fab was completed  we undertook an analysis of the potential production capacity at fab the results of the production capacity analysis led us to determine that fab s capacity would not be needed in the foreseeable future and during the september quarter we committed to a plan to sell fab we have retained a third party broker to market fab on our behalf 
accordingly  fab was classified as an asset held for sale as of september  and maintained that classification at march  we retained an independent third party firm  other than our independent auditors  to complete a fair value appraisal of fab the independent third party used the market approach and considered sales of comparable properties in determining the fair value of fab the comparable sales included eight properties  including our purchases of fab in july and fab in august based on the results of this appraisal  we recorded an asset impairment charge on fab of million  including estimated costs to sell 
the remaining value of million is classified as an asset held for sale and is included as a component of other current assets at march  during the quarter ended september   we also recorded an asset impairment charge of million to write down certain excess manufacturing equipment located at fab to its net realizable value of  this manufacturing equipment became excess as a result of duplicate equipment acquired in the purchase of fab the net realizable value for the excess manufacturing equipment was determined based on management estimates 
substantially all of the other manufacturing equipment located at fab has been transferred to and will be used in our other wafer fabrication facilities located in tempe  arizona fab and gresham  oregon fab 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those estimated in the appraisal  or if future market conditions deteriorate  the net proceeds from the assets held for sale could be less than the amount estimated in the financial statements and additional charges could result prior to or at the time of the sale of the facility 
powersmart in process research and development charge during the quarter ended june   purchased in process research and development of million  associated with our acquisition of powersmart  inc was written off at the date of the acquisition june  in accordance with fasb interpretation no 
 applicability of fasb statement no 
business combinations accounted for by the purchase method fin 
the value assigned to the in process research and development was determined by an independent valuation analysis performed by a firm other than our independent auditors 
as of the valuation date  there were projects that were considered to be in process 
the values of the projects were determined based on analyses of cash flows to be generated by the products that are expected to result from the in process projects 
these cash flows were estimated by forecasting total revenues expected from these products then deducting appropriate operating expenses  cash flow adjustments and contributory asset returns to establish a forecast of net return on in process technology 
these net returns were substantially reduced to take into account the time value of money and the risks associated with the inherent difficulties and uncertainties in achieving commercial readiness 
the above analysis resulted in million of value assigned to acquired in process research and development  which was expensed on the acquisition date in accordance with fin we believe the assumptions used in valuing the in process research and development are reasonable  but are inherently uncertain  and no assurance can be given that the assumptions made will occur 
during fiscal  we incurred development costs of approximately million related to the acquired in process research and development  and should the projects continue to move toward commercialization  we estimate that future expenditures could approximate million over the next few years 
none of the in process research and development projects had been completed as of march  the foregoing statement relating to our estimated future expenditures on the acquired in process r d projects is a forward looking statement 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others delays in completion of a particular project  changes in our prioritization of projects  changes in the specifications of a particular project  unforeseen engineering problems  and unanticipated costs 
fiscal there were no special charges incurred during fiscal fiscal during the march quarter  we implemented capacity and cost reduction actions necessitated by adverse business conditions in the semiconductor industry 
we reduced cumulative wafer fab capacity at fabs and by approximately  compared to our december  levels 
we also decided to close our hong kong test facility  acquired as part of the telcom transaction  and migrate these test requirements to our thailand test facility 
the capacity reduction at fabs and was completed by the end of the march quarter 
the closure of the hong kong facility was completed by june  these actions resulted in a restructuring charge of million in the march quarter 
these actions were undertaken to reduce both manufacturing capacity and manufacturing costs 
the reduction in wafer fab capacity was required due to reduced customer demand 
the closure of the hong kong facility was undertaken to rationalize our test manufacturing capacity and migrate the test requirements to our more cost effective test facility in thailand 
included in the restructuring charges resulting from these actions were o million related to equipment that was written off o million related to employee severance costs  and o million related to other restructuring costs 
on january   we completed our merger with telcom 
under the terms of the merger agreement  we exchanged each share of telcom common stock for of a share of our common stock 
we issued  shares of our common stock and assumed all outstanding telcom stock options 
the transaction was structured as a tax free reorganization and has been accounted for as a pooling of interests 
during the march quarter  we recognized a special charge of million for costs associated with the telcom transaction 
these costs included o million associated with investment banking fees o million associated with legal and accounting fees o million of severance costs  and o million related to other costs 
all reserves relating to the special charges for the fiscal actions have been fully utilized and there were no reversals of previously provided amounts 
other income expense interest income in fiscal decreased from interest income in fiscal as our average invested cash balances and the interest rates applicable to our invested cash balances were lower in fiscal compared to fiscal interest income in fiscal decreased from interest income in fiscal  although average invested cash balances were higher in fiscal the decrease in interest income in fiscal was primarily driven by significantly lower interest rates applicable to our invested cash balances during fiscal compared to the interest rates during fiscal provision for income taxes provisions for income taxes reflect tax on foreign earnings and federal and state tax on us earnings 
our effective tax rate was in fiscal  in fiscal and in fiscal  and is lower than statutory rates in the united states due primarily to lower tax rates at our foreign locations and r d tax credits 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal was due to the impairment portion of the special charges which provided an income tax benefit at a greater rate than our historic effective rate given the tax jurisdiction in which it occurred 
excluding special charges  our effective tax rate for fiscal was 
the decrease in our effective tax rate in fiscal compared to fiscal related to increased r d tax credits that were available to us 
as part of the process of preparing our consolidated financial statements  we are required to estimate our income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which we operate 
this process involves estimating our actual current tax exposure  together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within our consolidated balance sheet 
we must then assess the likelihood that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income within the relevant jurisdiction and  to the extent we believe that recovery is not likely  we must establish a valuation allowance 
we have not provided for a valuation allowance because we believe that our deferred tax asset will be recovered from future taxable income 
should we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax asset in the future  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would be charged to income in the period such determination was made 
at march   our gross deferred tax asset was million 
various taxing authorities in the united states and other countries in which we do business are increasing their scrutiny of various tax structures employed by businesses 
we believe that we maintain adequate tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit in the united states and other countries in which we do business 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be unnecessary  the resulting reversal of such reserves would result in tax benefits being recorded in the period the reserves are no longer deemed necessary 
if such amounts ultimately prove to be less than an ultimate assessment  a future charge to expense would be recorded in the period in which the assessment is determined 
our thailand manufacturing operations currently benefit from numerous tax holidays that have been granted to us by the thailand government based on our investments in property  plant and equipment in thailand 
although our tax holidays in thailand will partially expire in october  our manufacturing operations in thailand will be conducted using equipment that was invested pursuant to tax holidays that do not begin to expire until september we believe that the expiration of a portion of our tax holiday in thailand will not have a material impact on our effective tax rate in fiscal companies of our size and complexity are regularly audited by the taxing authorities in the jurisdictions in which they conduct significant operations 
we are currently under audit by the us internal revenue service for our fiscal years ended march    and the foregoing statements regarding the recoverability of our deferred tax asset from our future taxable income  the adequacy of our tax reserves to offset any potential tax liabilities that may arise upon audit and our belief that the expiration of a portion of our thai tax holiday will not have a material adverse impact on our fiscal effective tax rate are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others current and future tax laws and regulations  taxation rates in geographic regions where we have significant operations  results of any current or future audit conducted by the us internal revenue service or other taxing authorities in the countries in which we do business  and the level of our taxable income and whether our taxable income will be sufficient to utilize our deferred tax asset 
liquidity and capital resources we had million in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments at march   a decrease of million from the march  balance 
the decrease in cash  cash equivalents and short term investments over this time period is primarily attributable to the cash used in our june  acquisition of powersmart and our august  acquisition of fab  offset by cash generated from operating activities 
on february   we elected to terminate our unsecured revolving credit facility that we had maintained with a syndicate of banks since may the million credit facility was due to expire on may  there were no borrowings against the credit facility on february  we did not borrow against the credit facility in either fiscal or fiscal during the fiscal year ended march   we maintained an unsecured short term line of credit with various financial institutions in asia totaling million us dollar equivalent 
there were no borrowings under the foreign line of credit as of march   but an allocation of approximately million of the available line was made  relating to import guarantees associated with our business in thailand 
there are no covenants related to the foreign line of credit 
net cash provided from operating activities was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal the increase in cash flow from operations was primarily due to our results of operations after consideration of non cash special charges 
pre tax income in fiscal increased approximately million compared to fiscal after consideration of non cash special charges 
net cash used in investing activities was million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million in fiscal the increase in cash used in investing activities in fiscal over fiscal was primarily due to our acquisitions of fab and powersmart  increases in our short term investment balances and increased capital expenditures 
we enter into hedging transactions from time to time in an attempt to minimize our exposure to currency rate fluctuations 
although none of the countries in which we conduct significant foreign operations have had a highly inflationary economy in the last five years  there is no assurance that inflation rates or fluctuations in foreign currency rates in countries where we conduct operations will not adversely affect our operating results in the future 
our level of capital expenditures varies from time to time as a result of actual and anticipated business conditions 
capital expenditures were million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal the primary reasons for the dollar increase in capital expenditures in fiscal compared to fiscal were the purchase of fab  other selective investments to increase our manufacturing capacity in response to market demand and our continued investment in r d equipment 
in each of fiscal and fiscal  capital expenditures were primarily for the expansion of production capacity and the addition of research and development equipment 
we currently intend to spend approximately million during the next months to invest in equipment and facilities to maintain  and selectively increase  capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 
at march   we had contractual obligations of approximately million for the purchase or construction of property  plant and equipment 
the majority of these contractual obligations mature in the quarter ending june  we expect to finance capital expenditures through our existing cash balances  cash flows from operations  available debt arrangements and other sources of financing  including possible issuances of equity and debt securities depending on market conditions 
we believe that the capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next months will provide sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs 
the foregoing statements regarding the anticipated level of capital expenditures over the next months  the nature of such expenditures  the financing and sufficiency of our capital expenditures and the belief that capital expenditures anticipated to be incurred over the next months will provide us sufficient manufacturing capacity to meet our currently anticipated needs are forward looking statements 
actual results could differ materially because of the following factors  among others changes in demand for our products and those of our customers  changes in utilization of current manufacturing capacity  unanticipated costs in bringing fab on line  market acceptance of our products and of our customers products  the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry and the markets addressed by our products  the availability and cost of raw materials  equipment and other supplies  actual levels of capital expenditures  the costs and outcome of any litigation involving intellectual property  customer or other issues  the financial condition of our customers and vendors  uninsured losses  and the economic  political and other conditions in the worldwide markets served by us 
net cash used in financing activities was million for fiscal net cash provided by financing activities was million for fiscal and million for fiscal proceeds from the sale of stock  the exercise of stock options and employee purchases under our employee stock purchase plan were million for fiscal  million for fiscal and million for fiscal repayments on lines of credit were million in fiscal cash expended for the repurchase of our common stock was million in fiscal and million in fiscal on august   our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to  shares of our common stock in the open market or in privately negotiated transactions 
as of march   we had repurchased  shares of common stock for  as of march   all but  of the purchased shares had been reissued to fund stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan 
the timing and amount of any future repurchases will depend upon market conditions and corporate considerations 
on october   we announced that our board of directors had approved and instituted a quarterly cash dividend on our common stock 
the initial quarterly dividend of per share was paid on december  in the amount of  a second quarterly dividend payment of per share was paid on february  in the amount of  a third quarterly dividend of per share was declared on april  and was paid on may  in the amount of  we maintained a net shares settled forward contract during the years ended march  and the table below contains a summary of the share and cash activity under this contract in thousands shares received shares delivered net shares received delivered cash received   cash delivered net cash received delivered   during fiscal  we made a net delivery of  shares of our common stock 
we also received approximately million in connection with an early termination covering  of the shares outstanding under the net shares settled forward contract 
we closed out the net shares settled forward contract in its entirety on january  and made a cash payment of million to purchase the remaining  shares outstanding under the contract 
the purchased shares were held as treasury shares and were used to fund stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan through april  we believe that our existing sources of liquidity combined with cash generated from operations will be sufficient to meet our currently anticipated cash requirements for at least the next months 
however  the semiconductor industry is capital intensive 
in order to remain competitive  we must constantly evaluate the need to make significant investments in capital equipment for both production and research and development 
we may seek additional equity or debt financing during the next months for the capital expenditures required to maintain or expand our wafer fabrication and product assembly and test facilities  or other purposes 
the timing and amount of any such financing requirements will depend on a number of factors  including demand for our products  changes in industry conditions  product mix  and competitive factors 
there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  and any additional equity financing would result in incremental ownership dilution to our existing stockholders 
off balance sheet arrangements we do not have any transactions  arrangements and other relationships with unconsolidated entities that are reasonably likely to affect our liquidity or capital resources 
we have no special purpose or limited purpose entities that provided off balance sheet financing  liquidity or market or credit risk support  engage in leasing  hedging  research and development services  or other relationships that expose us to liability that is not reflected on the face of the financial statements

while sfas no

are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas no

fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees 
fin requires a guarantor to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation it has undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
we will apply fin to guarantees  if any  issued after december  at adoption  fin did not have a significant impact on our consolidated statements of income or financial position

requires certain variable interest entities  or vies  to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin no 
is effective for all vies created or acquired after january  for vies created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin no 
must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we currently have no contractual relationship or other business relationship with a variable interest entity and  therefore  we do not expect the adoption of fin no 
to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our investment portfolio  consisting of fixed income securities  was million as of march   and million as of march  these securities  like all fixed income instruments  are subject to interest rate risk and will decline in value if market interest rates increase 
if market rates were to increase immediately and uniformly by from the levels of march  and march   the decline in the fair value of our investment portfolio would not be material given that the our investments typically have interest rate reset features that regularly adjust to current market rates 
additionally  we have the ability to hold our fixed income investments until maturity and  therefore  we would not expect to recognize any material adverse impact in income or cash flows 
we have international operations and are thus subject to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
to date  our exposure related to exchange rate volatility has not been significant 
if foreign currency rates fluctuate by from the rates at march  and march   the effect on our financial position and results of operation would not be material given that we enter into foreign currency forward contracts to hedge our exposure to foreign currency rate fluctuations 
during the normal course of business we are routinely subjected to a variety of market risks  examples of which include  but are not limited to  interest rate movements and foreign currency fluctuations  as we discuss in this item a  and collectability of accounts receivable 
we continuously assess these risks and have established policies and procedures to protect against the adverse effects of these and other potential exposures 
although we do not anticipate any material losses in these risk areas  no assurance can be made that material losses will not be incurred in these areas in the future
