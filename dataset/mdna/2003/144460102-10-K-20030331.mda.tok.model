overview we were incorporated in september of as a successor company to koenig communications  inc  an equipment systems integration and consulting company which had been in operation since in the summer of  we ceased our systems integration and consulting business and commenced our main product sales with the introduction of the access bank products 
in the fourth quarter of  we began commercial deployment of our wide bank products and in january of  we began commercial deployment of our access navigator products 
in december of  we began deployment of the first of our adit products  and in october of  we acquired the broadmore products 
the axxius product started commercial deployment in june of accordingly  we have only a limited operating history on which to base an evaluation of our business and prospects 
our prospects must be considered in light of the risks  uncertainties and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in an early stage of development  particularly companies in new and rapidly evolving markets 
our net revenue is derived from the sales of broadband digital access equipment and accessories 
most of the sales of our products have historically been through distributors 
our distributors are responsible for warehousing products and fulfilling product orders as well as identifying potential service provider customers and  in some cases  customizing and integrating our products at end users sites 
in addition  significant portions of the sales of our products are currently being made through direct sales  and reseller and oem arrangements 
we believe that average selling prices and gross margins for our products will decline as such products mature  and as competition intensifies  among other factors 
in  we reduced the price of our wide bank  adit  and access bank products  and we expect to make further price reductions in with respect to certain wide bank  adit  and access bank products 
in addition  discounts to distributors  oems  and direct customers vary among product lines and are based on volume shipments  which affect gross margins 
we believe our gross margins are likely to fluctuate based on production levels  product type and channel mix 
gross margins will also likely be reduced from time to time by new product introductions 
in august of  we acquired all of the issued and outstanding common stock of millennia for cash of approximately million   shares of common stock valued at approximately million and the exchange of vested employee stock options valued at approximately  for total consideration of approximately million 
based on the purchase price allocation  approximately million of the purchase price was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets and was being amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to five years 
in the third quarter of an analysis of the value of the goodwill and other intangibles indicated that the value had been impaired  so we recorded an impairment charge of million 
in october of  we acquired the atm product lines of lnas located in roanoke  virginia 
the new carrier access broadmore product supplies oc c  ds  and t e services via broadband atm service provisioning and management for commercial and government applications 
we acquired the product lines for cash of approximately million 
based on the purchase price allocation  approximately million was allocated to goodwill and other intangible assets that are being amortized on a straight line basis over periods ranging from three to five years 
we review our goodwill annually for potential impairments  or more often if events or circumstances indicate a potential impariment may exist 
during the third quarter of  the projected demand for the commercial version of the broadmore product line decreased significantly 
as a result of such decline in demand  the company determined that goodwill and other intangible assets associated with the acquisition were impaired and recorded an impairment charge of million in the third quarter of in the third quarter of  continued decline in market demand indicated that an additional impairment was necessary and we recorded a charge of million representing the remaining goodwill on this product line

index to financial statements in december  we completed a restructuring plan designed to reduce our expenses to be more in line with anticipated revenue 
included in this plan were reductions in salary related expenses  facility closures or downsizing  and disposal of excess or unused assets 
as a result of these expense reductions  we took a charge in the fourth quarter of million 
our million restructuring charge included  for the impairment for certain capitalized assets that were either abandoned or are no longer in use and are held for sale 
the charge will result in an aggregate million cash outlay 
we paid approximately  of this charge in the fourth quarter of and expect to pay  in the first quarter of the remaining portion will be paid over the subsequent four quarters 
net revenue and cost of sales year ended december  in thousands net revenue cost of sales for the year ended  our net revenue decreased to million from million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the decreases in net revenue in and were due to decreases in the number of units of our products sold and price decreases in some of our products which were primarily caused by overall economic weakness and capital market constraints impacting telecommunication service providers and continued downturns in the telecommunications sector in a significant portion of our net revenue has been derived from a limited number of large orders  and we believe that this trend will continue in the future  especially if the percentage of direct sales to end users increases 
our net revenue continues to be affected by the timing and quantities of orders for our products which may vary from quarter to quarter in the future  as they have in the past  due to factors such as demand for our products  economic conditions  bankruptcies of our customers and distributors  ordering patterns of distributors  oems and other direct customers 
we believe that this trend could continue in the future  especially if the percentage of direct sales to end users increases 
the timing of customer orders and our ability to fulfill them can cause material fluctuations in our operating results and we anticipate that such fluctuations will occur in the future 
during  approximately half of our revenue was derived from the sales of our products through our distributors 
our success depends in part on the continued sales and customer support efforts of our network of distributors and increased sales to our direct customers 
in  walker  a distributor  accounted for of net revenue 
we expect that the sale of our products will continue to be made to a small number of distributors 
accordingly  the loss of  or a reduction in sales to  any of our key distributors could have a material adverse effect on our business 
in addition to being dependent on a small number of distributors for a majority of our net revenue  we believe that our products are distributed to a limited number of service provider customers 
in  one of these competitive carrier end user customers  xo  accounted for of our net revenue for the year ended december  a decrease in sales to xo could have a material adverse effect on our business 
although xo has completed restructuring its operations  it may not be in a position in the future to continue its current purchase levels 
cost of sales was million for compared to million for  and million for the decrease in was primarily attributable to decreased product shipments  partially influenced by cost reductions in existing product platforms  and partially offset charges taken in for slow moving and excess inventory 
in  the decrease in cost of sales was primarily attributable to decreased product shipments  and was partially offset by charges taken that year for excess and slow moving inventory 
gross margins year ended december  in thousands gross profit gross margin our gross profit for was million  a decrease of million from the gross profit of million in gross margin decreased to in from in and in the decrease in gross margin was driven primarily by reduced revenues  charges taken for slow moving and excess inventory  as well as changes in product mix 
our gross margins vary among products 
gross margins were also impacted by lower production volumes  decreases in selling prices  and increased overhead expenses 
these decreases in gross margins in were partially offset by product cost reductions 
gross profit in decreased million from a gross profit of million in this decrease was caused by the decreased shipments of our products and by charges taken for slow moving and excess inventory 
we believe that gross margins could continue to decrease if sales of our products decline and if additional pricing declines occur in our products at a greater rate than anticipated cost reductions or if we incur additional charges for slow moving and excess page

index to financial statements inventory 
new product introductions could also harm gross margins until production volumes increase 
we believe that average selling prices and gross margins for our products will decline as such products mature  as volume price discounts in distributor contracts and direct sales relationships take effect  and as competition intensifies  among other factors 
for example  the average selling price for the wide bank products and adit products have decreased in the past two years 
these decreases were due to unfavorable general economic conditions and the introduction of competitive products 
in addition  discounts to distributors vary among product lines and are based on volume shipments  each of which affects gross margins 
as a result  we believe that our gross margins are likely to fluctuate in the future based on product mix and channel mix 
furthermore  gross margins will likely be reduced from time to time as a result of new product introductions by our competitors and us 
research and development expenses year ended december  in thousands research and development expenses as a percentage of net revenue research and development expenses decreased to million in from million in this decrease of million was primarily due to reduced personnel and  to a lesser extent  reduced expenditures for prototyping and regulatory compliance 
research and development expenses increased from million in to million for this increase of million was primarily attributable to an increase in the number of personnel engaged in the development of new products  specifically the adit and adit products  the acquisition of two research and development facilities in roanoke  virginia and personnel added for enhancing our existing products 
we expect the amount of research and development expenses to decrease in as a result of our fourth quarter restructuring 
selling  general and administrative expenses year ended december  in thousands sales and marketing expenses general and administrative expenses goodwill and intangible asset amortization restructuring charge asset impairment charges total selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net revenue selling  general and administrative expenses increased to million in from million in sales and marketing expense decreases reflect the effect of downsizing and restructuring 
in addition  there was decreased marketing activity in customer support  advertising  and trade shows 
general and administrative expenses increased in due to charges taken for bad debt reserves and a charge related to a settlement for an inventory purchasing dispute 
we implemented a restructuring plan in the fourth quarter of  and anticipate that as a result  selling  general and administrative expenses will slightly decrease over the next few quarters 
selling  general and administrative expenses including goodwill amortization and asset impairment charge increased to of revenue in from of revenue in for the year ended  selling  general and administrative expense increased million to million 
marketing expense increases reflected increased hiring and marketing activity with respect to the introduction of the access navigator  adit and adit products  customer support  advertising and trade shows 
the increase in sales expenses was the result of our expanded sales activities and an increase in the size of the sales force and a corresponding increase in sales salaries and bonuses 
general and administrative expenses increased in  in part  due to the amortization of goodwill and other intangibles related to the acquisitions of millennia and the atm product lines from lnas as well as because of asset impairment charges of million related to goodwill 
stock based compensation as discussed in note to the consolidated financial statements  we account for our stock based compensation plans in accordance with accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
during and the six months ended june   we granted options to employees with exercise prices less than the fair market value per share based upon our previous preferred stock offerings and the estimated price per share in the initial public offering 
accordingly  we recorded deferred compensation expenses totaling approximately million 
in connection with the acquisition of millennia  we granted options with exercise prices below the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the grant 
we page

index to financial statements recorded deferred compensation expense totaling approximately  for these stock options 
compensation expense is recognized over the month vesting period of the options 
compensation expense totaled approximately   and  for   and  respectively 
at december   the unamortized balance of the deferred compensation charge was  it is our intention to grant future stock options with exercise prices equal to the fair value of the underlying common stock on the date of grant 
interest and other income interest and other income decreased to  in from million in this decrease of  was due to interest income earned on lower cash and cash equivalent balances as well as lower interest rates 
interest and other income decreased to million in from million in  due primarily to lower interest income earned on lower cash and cash equivalent balances 
income taxes for  our effective combined federal and state income tax rate was  compared to an income tax rate of for in the second quarter of  we determined that it was not more likely than not  based on our recent taxable losses  projections of future taxable income and the reversal of deferred tax liabilities  that our deferred tax assets would be realized 
as a result  we recorded a valuation allowance of million on our deferred tax assets 
we recorded an additional valuation allowance of million in the second half of to reduce the additional deferred tax assets generated during that period 
in both and  we realized a tax benefit from research and experimentation tax credits  which increased the effective rate of the tax benefit in  and reduced the effective rate of our tax expense in we had a combined income tax rate in of

liquidity and capital resources as of december  in thousands working capital cash  cash equivalents and securities total assets year end december  in thousands net cash provided used by operating activities investing activities financing activities cash flows net cash used by operating activities totaled million in and million in our increased net loss in  and cash spent to decrease accounts payable and accrued compensation payable  were substantially offset by decreases in our accounts receivable and inventory 
cash used by operating activities in was primarily due to cash spent to increase inventory and decrease accounts payable 
our cash balances were further reduced in as a result of our net loss 
cash used by investing activities was million for the year ended december   compared to cash provided of million for the year ended december  cash used by investing activities in was primarily the result of purchase of property and equipment  partially offset by the maturity of available for sale securities 
sales and dispositions of property and equipment for resulted in net cash provided of millioncompared to a cash outflow of millionfor purchases of equipment to support research  development  and manufacturing activities for we believe our current facilities and equipment are sufficient to meet our current operating requirements 
cash provided by financing activities was approximately  for and  for cash provided by financing activities in and was primarily due to the exercise of stock options

index to financial statements our inventory levels decreased to approximately million at december  from approximately million at december  the decrease was due to reduced purchasing in as we sold some of the inventory we had on hand to satisfy customer orders instead of producing new goods 
we anticipate that inventory levels will continue to decline in due to continued low purchasing levels 
we believe that our inventory reserves are appropriate 
liquidity to date  we have funded our operations primarily through cash generated from operations and sales of common and preferred stock 
at december   our principal sources of liquidity included cash and cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale of approximately million compared to million at december  at december   our working capital was approximately million and decreased to million at december  we also have an income tax receivable of million at december   that we believe we will receive in the second quarter of we have no significant capital spending or purchase commitments other than those discussed below 
see note of notes to consolidated financial statements 
we believe that our existing cash and investment balances are adequate to fund our projected working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
because our operating results fluctuate significantly due to decreases in customer demand or decreases in the acceptances of our future products  we may continue to be unable to generate positive cash flow from operations 
should the need arise  it may become necessary to borrow additional funds or otherwise raise additional capital 
however  we cannot assure you that additional funds or capital will be available to us in adequate amounts or with reasonably acceptable terms 
we may consider using our capital to make strategic investments or to acquire or license technology or products 
we may also enter into strategic alliances with third parties that could provide access to additional capital 
any such activities could require us to obtain additional financing 
contractual obligations and commercial commitments we have obligations under certain operating lease commitments 
the future rent obligations as of december   under these commitments are as follows million for one year  million for two to three years  million for four to five years  and  after five years  respectively 
in addition  as of december   we have an outstanding commitment to purchase million of parts inventory from one of our contract manufacturers within the first half of we have no minimum cash requirements  debt obligations or other contractual obligations and commercial commitments as of december  critical accounting policies our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based upon our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to revenue and product returns  inventory valuations  allowance for doubtful accounts  intangible assets  deferred income taxes and warranty reserves 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we consider the following accounting areas to have the most significant impact on the reported financial results and financial position of our company 
also  see note to consolidated financial statements for a summary of our significant accounting policies 
revenue recognition 
we recognize revenue from product sales at the time of shipment and passage of title using guidance from sec staff accounting bulletin no 
revenue recognition in financial statements 
in addition  we also offer certain of our customers the right to return products for a limited time after shipment as part of a stock rotation 
we estimate what future stock rotation returns may occur based upon actual historical return rates and reduce our revenue by these estimated returns 
if future returns exceed our estimates  revenue could be further reduced 
in addition  modifications to generally accepted accounting principles could result in unanticipated changes in our revenue recognition policies and such changes could significantly affect future revenue and results of operations 
inventory reserves 
we value our inventory at the lower of the actual cost to purchase and or manufacture the inventory or the current estimated net realizable value of inventory 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision for excess and obsolete inventory based primarily on our estimated forecast of product demand and production requirements 
we write down our inventory for estimated obsolescence or unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the cost of inventory and the estimated net realizable value based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
if actual future demand or page 
table of contents 
index to financial statements market conditions are less favorable than our estimates  then additional inventory write downs may be required 
allowance for doubtful accounts 
we perform ongoing credit evaluations of our customers and adjust open account status based upon payment history and the customer s current creditworthiness  as determined by our review of current credit information 
we continuously monitor collections and payments from our customers and maintain a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the age of outstanding invoices and any specific customer collection issues that we have identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that we have in the past 
because our accounts receivable are concentrated in a relatively few number of customers  a significant change in the liquidity or financial position of any one of these customers could have a material adverse impact on our ability to collect our accounts receivables and on our future operating results 
valuation of intangible assets 
we regularly evaluate the potential impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets from our purchase business acquisitions 
in assessing whether the value of our goodwill and other intangibles has been impaired  we must make assumptions regarding estimated future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value of these assets 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record additional impairment charges 
deferred income taxes 
we account for our deferred tax assets pursuant to sfas no 
accounting for income taxes sfas no 

under sfas no 
 a deferred tax asset is recognized for temporary differences that will result in tax deductions in future years and for tax credit carryforwards 
current income tax expense benefit represents actual or estimated amounts payable or receivable on tax return filings each year 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are recorded for the estimated future tax effects of temporary differences between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and amount reported in the accompanying balance sheets  and for operating loss and tax credit carryforwards 
the change in deferred tax assets and liabilities for the period measure the deferred tax provision or benefit for the period 
effects of changes in enacted tax laws on deferred tax assets and liabilities are reflected as adjustments to the tax provision or benefit in the period of enactment 
a valuation allowance is required under sfas no 
to reduce deferred tax assets if management cannot conclude that realization of such assets is more likely than not at the balance sheet date 
warranty reserves 
we offer warranties of various lengths to our customers depending on the specific product and the terms of our customer purchase agreements 
our standard warranties require us to repair or replace defective product returned to us during the warranty period at no cost to the customer 
we record an estimate for warranty related costs based on our actual historical return rates and repair costs at the time of sale 
on an on going basis  management reviews these estimates against actual expenses and makes adjustments when necessary 
while our warranty costs have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same warranty return rates or repair costs that we have in the past 
a significant increase in products return rates or the costs to repair our products could have a material adverse impact on our operating results 
off balance sheet arrangements 
we have no off balance sheet arrangements

the company is currently evaluating whether or not it will adopt the fair value based method  and accordingly has not determined the impact that this standard will have on its financial position or results of operations 
the company has adopted the expanded disclosure provisions of sfas no

elaborates on the disclosures made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
it also clarifies that a guarantor is required to recognize  at the inception of a guarantee  a liability for the fair value of the obligation undertaken in issuing the guarantee 
this interpretation does not prescribe a specific approach for subsequently measuring the guarantor s recognized liability over the term of the related guarantee 
this interpretation also incorporates  without change  the guidance in fasb interpretation no 
 disclosure of indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which is being superseded
