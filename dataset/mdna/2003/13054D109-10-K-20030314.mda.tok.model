item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview as of march   we own and operate casual dining restaurants under the names california pizza kitchen and california pizza kitchen asap in states and the district of columbia 
we also franchise our concept and currently have additional restaurants  which operate under franchise or license arrangements 
during our years of operating history  we believe we have developed strong brand awareness and demonstrated the appeal of our concept in a wide variety of geographic areas 
our concept was  and remains  to take our customers favorite food cravings and put them on a pizza to figuratively put the world on a pizza 
we opened our first casual dining restaurant in in beverly hills  california and grew steadily to restaurants by early our concept  with its signature line of innovative  premium pizzas  open flame ovens in exhibition style kitchens and excellent guest service  attracted pepsico  inc hereafter referred to as pepsico which bought a controlling interest in our company in may  during the approximately five year period when pepsico was our controlling shareholder  we opened restaurants  of which have subsequently been closed 
we experimented with different locations and different restaurant sizes  ranging from  square feet to more than  square feet 
our rapid expansion strained our infrastructure  resulted in a variety of management and operational changes  diverted our attention from the execution of our concept and led to disappointing operating results and financial performance  including a decline in comparable restaurant sales in at the end of  pepsico concluded that it would sell or otherwise divest all of its restaurant businesses  including california pizza kitchen 
in september  we consummated a series of transactions to effect a merger and leveraged recapitalization through which an investor group led by bruckmann  rosser  sherrill co  lp acquired pepsico s interest in our company 
since the beginning of  we have instituted an accelerated  but disciplined  growth plan  focusing largely on further penetrating our existing markets 
between january and december  we opened new company owned  full service restaurants and three asap restaurants 
we intend to open a minimum of company owned  full service restaurants in we have signed lease agreements or letters of intent for all of these restaurants 
we anticipate that our new restaurants will require a cash investment  net of landlord contributions  of approximately million per restaurant 
pre opening expenses for each of these new restaurants is expected to average approximately  to  per restaurant 
additionally  our new restaurants experience higher cost of sales  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs for approximately their first to days of operations in both percentage and dollar terms when compared with our mature restaurants 
accordingly  the volume and timing of new restaurant openings has had  and is expected to continue to have  an impact on pre opening expenses  cost of sales  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs until our restaurant operating base is large enough to mitigate these opening costs and inefficiencies

our restaurant sales are comprised almost entirely of food and beverage sales

components of this category include management  supervisory and staff salaries and related employee benefits  travel and relocation costs  information systems  training  corporate rent and professional and consulting fees

pre opening costs  which are expensed as incurred  consist of the costs of hiring and training the initial work force  travel  the cost of food used in training  marketing costs  the cost of the initial stocking of operating supplies and other direct costs related to the opening of a new restaurant 
in calculating comparable company owned restaurant sales  we include a restaurant in the comparable base once it has been open for months 
as of december   we had full service company owned restaurants which met this criterion

potential fluctuations in quarterly results and seasonality our quarterly operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of a variety of factors  including the timing of new restaurant openings and related expenses  profitability of new restaurants  increases or decreases in comparable restaurant sales  general economic conditions  consumer confidence in the economy  changes in consumer preferences  competitive factors  changes in food costs  changes in labor costs  war and weather conditions 
in the past we have experienced significant variability in pre opening costs from quarter to quarter 
these fluctuations are primarily a function of the timing of restaurant openings 
we typically incur the most significant portion of pre opening costs associated with a given restaurant within the one month immediately preceding  and the month of  opening a new restaurant 
in addition  our experience to date has been that labor and direct operating and occupancy costs associated with a newly opened restaurant during the first three to four months of operation are often materially greater than what will be expected after that time  both in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of restaurant sales 
accordingly  the number and timing of new restaurant openings in any quarter has had  and is expected to continue to have  a significant impact on quarterly pre opening costs and labor and direct operating and occupancy costs 
as a result of our plans to open new restaurants at an accelerated pace  we anticipate that we will experience significantly increased pre opening costs  labor and direct operating and occupancy costs in our business is also subject to seasonal fluctuations 
historically  sales in most of our restaurants have been higher during the summer months and winter holiday season 
as a result  we expect our highest earnings to occur in those periods 
as a result of all of these factors  results for any one quarter are not necessarily indicative of the results to be expected for any other quarter or for any year 
liquidity and capital resources in recent years we have funded our capital requirements primarily through cash flow from operations and proceeds from the initial public offering of our stock 
in  net cash flow provided by operating activities was million compared to million in and million in net cash flow provided by operating activities exceeded net income for due to the effects of depreciation and amortization  loss on impairment of property and equipment and restaurant closures  change in deferred tax asset and the net changes in operating assets and liabilities 
the net change in operating assets and liabilities in was primarily due to a decrease in trade receivables due to the collection of landlord contributions and an increase in accounts payable  accrued and other liabilities 
in both and  net cash flow provided by operating activities exceeded the net income due to the effects of depreciation and amortization  loss on impairment of property and equipment and restaurant closures  a non recurring compensation charge in and changes in working capital 
we use cash to fund the development and construction of new restaurants and remodel our existing restaurants 
net cash used in investing activities in was million  of which million was spent on new restaurants and million was spent on remodels and capitalized maintenance 
we opened new restaurants in compared to in net cash used in investing activities for was million  of which million was spent on new restaurants opened in and million was spent on remodels 
net cash used in investing activities for was million  of which approximately million was spent on new restaurants opened in and million was spent on remodels 
we expect to open a minimum of full service restaurants in and anticipate these planned future restaurants will require  on average  a total cash investment per restaurant  after landlord contributions  of approximately million 
additionally  we anticipate pre opening costs on average to be approximately  to  however  any unexpected delays in construction  labor shortages or other factors could result in higher than anticipated pre opening costs 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in financing activities in consisted of employee common stock option exercises and purchases under our employee stock purchase plan

financing activities in consisted primarily of million from the sale of securities  net of underwriting fees and expenses  offset by debt payments of million and cash payments of million to our preferred shareholders upon conversion of their preferred stock into common stock 
as of december  we have a million revolving line of credit  of which nothing is currently outstanding 
the line of credit expires on june  and bears interest at either the bank base rate minus or libor plus 
availability under the credit facility is reduced by outstanding letters of credit  which totaled million as of december  in addition  the credit facility includes financial and non financial covenants  with which the company was in full compliance as of december  and as of the date of this report 
our capital requirements  including costs related to opening additional restaurants  have been and will continue to be significant 
our future cash requirements and the adequacy of available funds will depend on many factors  including the pace of expansion  real estate markets  site locations and the nature of the arrangements negotiated with landlords 
we believe that our current cash balances  together with anticipated cash flows from operations and funds anticipated to be available from our credit facility  will be sufficient to satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements on a short term and long term basis 
changes in our operating plans  acceleration of our expansion plans  lower than anticipated sales  increased expenses or other events may cause us to seek additional financing sooner than anticipated 
additional financing may not be available on acceptable terms  or at all 
failure to obtain additional financing as needed could have a material adverse effect on our business and results of operations

critical accounting policies critical accounting policies are those that we believe are most important to portraying our financial condition and results of operations and also require the greatest amount of subjective or complex judgments by management 
judgments or uncertainties regarding the application of these policies may result in materially different amounts being reported under different conditions or using different assumptions 
we consider the following policies to be the most critical in understanding the judgments that are involved in preparing our consolidated financial statements 
property and equipment property and equipment is recorded at cost 
property and equipment is depreciated over the assets estimated useful lives using the straight line method 
leasehold improvements are amortized using the straight line method over the estimated useful life of the asset or the term of the related lease  whichever is shorter 
the lives for furniture  fixtures  and equipment are ten years 
the lives for buildings and leasehold improvements are the shorter of years or the term of the related operating lease 
income taxes the company utilizes the liability method of accounting for income taxes as set forth in statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under the liability method  deferred taxes are determined based on the difference between the financial statement and the tax basis of assets and liabilities using enacted tax rates in effect in the years in which the differences are expected to reverse 
recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to amounts considered by management to be more likely than not of realization in future periods 
restaurant and franchise revenues revenues from the operation of company owned restaurants are recognized when sales occur 
all fees from franchised operations are included in revenue as earned 
royalty fees are based on franchised restaurants revenues and are recorded by the company in the period the related franchised restaurants revenues are earned 
pre opening costs the company follows statement of position sop  reporting on the costs of start up activities  which was issued by the accounting standards executive committee and provides guidance on the financial reporting of the start up costs and organization costs 
the sop requires costs of start up activities and organization costs to be expensed as incurred 
stock based compensation statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  encourages but does not require a fair value based method of accounting for employee stock options or similar equity instruments 
sfas no 
allows an entity to elect to continue to measure compensation costs under accounting principles board opinion apb no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  but requires pro forma disclosure of net earnings as if the fair value based method of accounting had been applied 
the company elected to follow apb no 
 and related interpretations in accounting for our employee stock options because the alternative fair value accounting provided for under sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  requires use of option valuation models that were not developed for use in valuing employee stock options 
under apb no 
 because the exercise price of our employee stock options equals or exceeds the fair value of the underlying stock on the date of grant  no compensation expense is recognized 
new accounting standards the financial accounting standards board fasb recently issued several statements of financial accounting standards sfas 
the statements relevant to our line of business and the impact on us are as follows in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 business combinations  and no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  statement requires that the purchase method of accounting be used for all business combinations initiated after june  under sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives will no longer be amortized but will be subject to annual impairment tests 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their useful lives 
as of december   we wrote off all intangible balances of goodwill  which resulted in amortization expense of in august  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  which addresses financial accounting and reporting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and supersedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and the accounting and reporting provisions of accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations for a disposal of a segment of a business 
sfas no

we recorded a million expense associated with impairment charges and anticipated closure costs for one company owned full service restaurant and one company owned asap restaurant 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
supersedes emerging issues task force eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas no 
requires a liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity to be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect the adoption of this statement to have an impact on the consolidated results of operations or financial position 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends fasb statement no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  to provide alternative methods of transition to sfas no 
s fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas no 
also amends the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
and apb opinion no 
 interim financial reporting  to require disclosure in the summary of significant accounting policies of the effects of an entity s accounting policy with respect to stock based employee compensation on reported net income and earnings per share in annual and interim financial statements 
while sfas no 
does not amend sfas no 
to require companies to account for employee stock options using the fair value method  the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
are applicable to all companies with stock based employee compensation  regardless of whether they account for that compensation using the fair value method of sfas no 
or the intrinsic value method of apb opinion no 
as allowed by sfas no 
 we have elected to continue to utilize the accounting method prescribed by apb opinion no 
and have adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
inflation the primary inflationary factors affecting our operations are food and labor costs 
a large number of our restaurant personnel are paid at rates based on the applicable minimum wage  and increases in the minimum wage directly affect our labor costs 
many of our leases require us to pay taxes  maintenance  repairs  insurance and utilities  all of which are generally subject to inflationary increases 
we believe inflation has not had a material impact on our results of operations in recent years 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk s our market risk exposures are related to our cash and cash equivalents 
as of december  we invested our excess cash in highly liquid investments with maturities of less than three months as of the date of purchase 
these investments are not held for trading or other speculative purposes 
changes in interest rates affect the investment income we earn on our investments and therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
in addition  we have a million line of credit agreement with bank of america  na that expires on june  interest on the line of credit is calculated on either the bank base rate minus or libor plus 
currently  there is no outstanding balance under this agreement 
should we draw on this line in the future  changes in interest rates would affect the interest expense on these loans and therefore  impact our cash flows and results of operations 
many of the food products purchased by us are affected by changes in weather  production  availability  seasonality and other factors outside our control 
in an effort to control some of this risk  we have entered into some fixed price purchase commitments with terms of no more than a year 
in addition  we believe that almost all of our food and supplies are available from several sources  which helps to control food commodity risks
