item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview national health realty  inc nhr or the company is a real estate investment trust reit that began operations on january  currently nhr  through its subsidiary nhr op  lp the operating partnership  owns the real estate of health care facilities  including licensed skilled nursing facilities  six assisted living facilities and one independent living center the health care facilities  and owns first and second mortgage promissory notes with principal balances totaling  the notes at december  and secured by the real property of health care facilities 
competitive restrictions we have an advisory services agreement with national healthcare corporation nhc pursuant to which nhc will provide us with investment advice  office space and personnel 
nhc owns or manages long term care health care facilities with  beds in states 
the advisory services agreement provides that prior to the earlier to occur of i the termination of the advisory agreement for any reason or ii nhc ceasing to be actively engaged as the investment advisor for national health investors  inc nhi  we will not without the prior approval of nhi transact business with any party  person  company or firm other than nhc 
it is the intent of the foregoing restriction that we will not be actively or passively engaged in the pursuit of additional investment opportunities  but rather we will focus upon our capacities as landlord and note holder of those certain assets conveyed to us by nhc s predecessor 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates and cause our reported net income to vary significantly from period to period 
in december  the sec requested that all registrants list their three to five most critical accounting policies in md a 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one which is both important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
we believe that our following accounting policies fit this definition valuations of and impairments to our investments since the long term health care industry has experienced material reductions in government and private insurance reimbursements 
while some legislative relief was granted in and  additional reductions in reimbursement have been imposed effective october  the long term health care industry has also experienced a dramatic increase in professional liability claims and in the cost of insurance to cover such claims 
these factors have combined to cause a number of bankruptcy filings  bankruptcy court rulings and court judgments about refinancing which have affected some of our lessees and mortgagees 
based on events occurring during the first and fourth quarters of  we determined that impairment of certain of our investments had occurred 
decisions about valuations and impairments of our investments require significant judgements and estimates on the part of management 
for real estate properties  the need to recognize an impairment is evaluated on a property by property basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
recognition of an impairment is based upon estimated future cash flows from a property compared to the carrying value of the property 
for notes receivable  impairment recognition is based upon an evaluation of the estimated collectibility of loan payments and general economic conditions on a specific loan basis in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting by creditors for impairment of a loan an amendment of fasb statements no 
and 
while we believe that the carrying amounts of our properties and notes receivable are realizable  it is possible that future events could require us to make significant adjustments or revisions to these estimates 
revenue recognition mortgage interest and rental income we collect interest and rent from our customers 
generally our policy is to recognize revenues on an accrual basis as earned 
however  we may in the future determine that  based on insufficient historical collections and the lack of expected future collections  revenue for interest or rent is not realizable 
for any such nonperforming investments  our policy is to recognize interest or rental income only in the period when payments are made 
this policy could cause our revenues to vary significantly from period to period 
reit status and taxes we believe that we have operated our business so as to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended the code and we intend to continue to operate in such a manner  but no assurance can be given that we will be able to qualify at all times 
if we qualify as a reit  we will generally not be subject to federal corporate income taxes on our net income that is currently distributed to its stockholders 
this treatment substantially eliminates the double taxation at the corporate and stockholder levels that typically applies to corporate dividends 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would cause us to owe state and federal income taxes and would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows 
capital resources and liquidity at year end  our debt as a percentage of total liabilities and capital was 
this debt of  includes a term loan with a principal amount of  our credit facility of million matured in december   but was extended for another one year term upon the payment to the credit facility group of million in december the extended credit facility bears interest at variable rates  currently at the eurodollar rate plus at december  
of the million in principal repaid  million was obtained by the prepayment of that amount of first mortgage debt owed to us by nhc  and million by the sale of three mortgage note receivables to national health investors  inc nhi 
these notes were sold at par  but with nhr maintaining a right to repurchase the notes at par after july  and nhi maintaining the right to put the notes to nhr at par beginning january   either on thirty days notice 
in order to address our million of debt maturities and our potential obligation to repurchase the million of mortgage notes from nhi  we plan to obtain proceeds from the refinancing of certain assets through first mortgage notes with community banks and existing lenders 
although we believe that we will be successful in refinancing our obligations  no assurance can be given in this regard 
our cash flows from operating activities will not be adequate to meet these entire obligations 
the inability to obtain adequate refinancing prior to december  would have a material adverse effect on our financial position  results of operation and cash flows 
leases we lease our health care facilities to various lessees properties are leased to nhc  and nine properties that were previously leased to nhc are leased to nine separate lessees not related to nhc 
with respect to these nine properties  nhc remains obligated under its master lease agreement and continues to remain obligated to make the lease payments to us 
lease payments made to us from the new lessees are credited against nhc s overall rent obligation 
at december   all payments are current 
our leases with nhc and the nine separate lessees have initial five or ten year terms with provisions for two five year renewal terms 
transfer of notes receivable to nhi effective december   we transferred three mortgage notes receivable secured by three long term care facilities in florida with total principal balances outstanding and a total carrying amount of  to nhi 
we received cash from nhi equal to our carrying amount 
the transfer agreement with nhi includes provisions that allow us the ability to repurchase the transferred notes at any time at a price equal to the outstanding principal and interest balance 
the agreement also provides that  beginning july   nhi may put the notes back to us at a price equal to the outstanding principal and interest balance 
as the result of the repurchase and put options  consistent with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for transfers and servicing of financial assets and extinguishments of liabilities sfas  we account for the transfer of notes receivable to nhi as a borrowing from nhi rather than as a sale of the notes 
we continue to recognize the notes receivable on our consolidated balance sheet as of december   and will continue to recognize interest income on the notes 
additionally  we have recognized an obligation to nhi on our consolidated balance sheet as of december  and will recognize interest expense on such obligation 
fcc notes of the  of mortgage and other notes receivable   is due from florida convalescent centers  inc fcc of sarasota  florida 
the fcc notes bear interest at and substantially all of the notes mature october  the fcc notes may be prepaid without penalty 
if prepayment occurs  we will apply some or all of the proceeds against our bank debt 
if not so used  we will attempt to reinvest any amounts prepaid 
our existing line of credit requires a portion of the prepayments to be used to reduce bank debt 
in the event that we use any prepayments to pay down existing debt  a reduction of our cash flow will result 
however  no dividend reductions are expected in the near future 
effective july   the fcc centers were leased to integrated health systems  inc ihs  which filed for bankruptcy protection on february  pursuant to court order  the ihs lease was terminated and the fcc centers re leased to schwartzberg associates  a private multi state long term care company  during the second quarter of the ability of fcc to service the mortgage notes held by us is dependent on schwartzberg associates ability to make its lease payments to fcc 
our payments from fcc are current as of december  approximately  of our notes receivable from fcc are secured by second mortgages on eight florida nursing homes 
the first mortgage notes on these eight facilities total approximately  at december   are tax exempt and are additionally secured with letters of credit issued by norwest bank minnesota na accordingly  norwest bank currently holds a first mortgage that is senior to our second mortgage on these eight florida nursing homes 
hsmi sale effective january   we sold all of the real estate and equipment of the three long term health care centers under lease to health services management of indiana  llc hsmi to hsmi 
consideration for the sale and assumption of the  first mortgage and the properties is in the form of new mortgage notes in the total amount of  we account for this transaction under the deposit method in accordance with the provisions of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for sales of real estate  sfas 
consistent with the deposit method  we have not recorded the sale of the assets and continue to record depreciation expense each period 
any cash received from the buyer which since the sale totals  as of december  is reported as deposit on real estate properties sold until the down payment and continuing investment criteria of sfas are met  at which time we will account for the sale under the full accrual method 
we concluded that based on our statement of accounting standards no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas impairment analysis and on certain events  these real estate properties required write downs in the net book value of  write downs of  and  were recorded during the first and fourth quarters of  respectively 
we believe that the carrying amount of these assets of  at december   after the above write downs is realizable 
it is possible that additional events could occur that  if adverse to nhr  would indicate a further impairment of the net carrying amount of these real estate properties 
if such adverse events occur  we will record additional losses in the period the events occur or become known 
sources and uses of funds our leasing and mortgage services generated net cash from operating activities during in the amount of  compared to  in the prior period 
net cash from operating activities generally includes net income plus non cash expenses  such as depreciation and amortization and provisions for realty and loan losses  if any  and working capital changes 
the year to year increase is due primarily to reduced interest expense and increases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities 
cash flows provided by investing activities during included no purchases of property and equipment compared to a net investment of  in the purchase of property and equipment in the prior year 
also  cash of  was provided by the prepayment of two mortgage notes receivable compared to no prepayment in the prior year

cash flows used in investing activities during include an investment in marketable securities of  compared to no investment in marketable securities in the prior year 
cash flows from financing activities included million of proceeds from nhi 
payments on debt were  in compared to  of payments on debt in the same period last year 
cash flows used in financing activities included  to pay dividends to stockholders  last year   to pay cash distributions to minority partners of our operating partnership  last year  and  to payment of financing costs none last year 
commitments we intend to pay quarterly distributions to our stockholders in an amount at least sufficient to satisfy the distribution requirements of a real estate investment trust 
such requirements necessitate that at least of our taxable income be distributed annually 
the primary source for distributions will be rental and interest income we earn on the real property and mortgage notes receivable 
dividends in the amount of per share were declared for payment during nhi maintains the right to resell three mortgage notes receivable to nhr at the then par value beginning january  or require us to make the debt service payments required under the notes 
par value of the notes is million at december  during the fourth quarter of  nhc  as the holder of certain promissory notes made by national health corporation and previously guaranteed in part by us  released our guarantee 
therefore  there is no longer any potential liability on our part for any default by national or nhc on any of their outstanding debt

funds from operations we have adopted the definition of funds from operations ffo prescribed by the national association of real estate investment trusts nareit 
ffo is defined as net income loss applicable to common stockholders computed in accordance with generally accepted accounting principles gaap excluding gains or losses from sales of property  plus depreciation of real property and after investments for unconsolidated entities in which a reit holds an interest 
ffo should not be considered as an alternative to net income or any other gaap measurement of performance as an indicator of operating performance or as an alternative to cash flows form operations  investing or financing activities as a measure of liquidity 
ffo is helpful in evaluating a real estate investment portfolio s overall performance considering the fact that historical cost accounting implicitly assumes that the value of real estate assets diminishes predictably over time 
the following table reconciles net income loss applicable to common stockholders to funds from to operations applicable to common stockholders year ended december  net income applicable to common stockholder s    adjustments real estate depreciation    impairment losses related to depreciable property  adjustment for minority interest affiliates   funds from operations applicable to common stockholders   basic funds from operations per share diluted funds from operations per share weighted average shares basic    diluted    future rental and mortgage interest income uncertainties our rental and mortgage interest income revenues are believed by management to be secure 
however  the majority of the income of our lessees and borrowers is derived from the lessees participation in the medicare and medicaid programs 
adverse changes in these programs or the inability of our lessees and borrowers to participate in these programs would have a material adverse impact on the financial position  results of operations and cash flows of our lessees and borrowers and their resultant ability to service their obligations to us 
none of our lessees or borrowers are in bankruptcy  but the facilities that secure the fcc notes were initially leased by fcc to integrated health systems  inc ihs  which filed for bankruptcy protection february  by court order  the lease was terminated in fcc immediately re leased the properties to schwartzberg associates  a private  multi state long term care company 
the ability of fcc to service the mortgage notes held by us is initially dependent on schwartzberg associates ability to make its lease payments to fcc or  in the absence of lease payments  fcc s ability to operate or release these facilities 
all fcc note payments are current as of december  income taxes we intend at all times to qualify as a reit under sections through of the internal revenue code of  as amended 
therefore  we will not be subject to federal income tax provided we distribute at least of our annual reit taxable income to our stockholders and meet other requirements to continue to qualify as a reit 
accordingly  no provision for federal income taxes has been made in the consolidated financial statements 
our failure to continue to qualify under the applicable reit qualification rules and regulations would have a material adverse impact on our financial position  results of operations and cash flows

impact of inflation inflation may affect us in the future by changing the underlying value of our real estate or by impacting our cost of financing its operations 
our revenues are primarily from long term investments

item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk interest rate risk our cash and cash equivalents consist of highly liquid investments with a maturity of less than three months 
substantially all of our mortgage and other notes receivable bear interest at fixed interest rates 
as a result of the short term nature of our cash instruments and because the interest rates on our investment in notes receivable are fixed  a hypothetical change in interest rates has no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
as of december    of our long term debt bears interest at floating interest rates 
because the interest rates of these instruments are variable  a hypothetical increase in interest rates would result in additional annual interest expense of  and a reduction in interest rates would result in annual interest expense declining  the remaining  of our long term debt bears interest at fixed rates 
a hypothetical change in interest rates has no impact on our future earnings and cash flows related to these instruments 
we currently do not use any derivative instruments to hedge interest rate or other risks 
we do not use derivative instruments for trading purposes 
the future use of such instruments would be subject to strict approvals by our senior officers 
therefore  our exposure related to such derivative instruments is not material to our financial position  results of operations or cash flows
