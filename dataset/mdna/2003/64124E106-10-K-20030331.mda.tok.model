item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations overview since its inception in september  neurogen has been engaged in the discovery and development of drugs 
the company has not derived any revenue from product sales and expects to incur significant losses in most years prior to deriving any such product revenues 
revenues to date have come from five collaborative research agreements  one license agreement and one technology transfer agreement 
the preparation of neurogen s financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make certain estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
management makes estimates in the areas of revenue recognition  income taxes  stock based compensation and marketable securities and investments 
estimates are based on historical experience and on various other assumptions that management believes to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual amounts could differ from those estimates 
the company believes the following critical accounting policies affect management s more significant judgments and estimates used in the preparation of neurogen s financial statements revenue recognition each of neurogen s collaborative research  licensing and technology transfer agreements are significant since the terms of such arrangements may cause the company s operating results to vary considerably from period to period 
the company has entered into collaborative research agreements which provide for the partial funding of specified projects in exchange for the grant of certain rights related to potential discoveries 
revenue under these arrangements typically includes upfront non refundable fees  ongoing payments for specified levels of staffing for research and milestone payments upon occurrence of certain events 
the upfront fees are recognized as revenue ratably over the period of performance under the research agreement 
the research funding is recognized as revenue as the related research effort is performed 
revenue derived from the achievement of milestones is recognized when the milestone event occurs and such event represents the achievement of a specific  substantive goal measuring a substantive stage of development towards a long term goal  such as the filing of a new drug application with the food and drug administration 
neurogen has also entered into  and now completed  a technology transfer agreement under which revenue has been recognized when a contractual arrangement exists  fees are fixed and determinable  delivery of the technology has occurred and collectibility is reasonably assured 
when customer acceptance was required  revenue was deferred until acceptance occurred 
where there were on going services or obligations after delivery  revenue has been recognized over the related term of the service on a percentage of completion basis  unless such service was maintenance  in which case revenue has been recognized on a straight line basis 
for a contract with multiple elements  total contract fees are allocated to the different elements based on evidence of fair value 
income taxes the liability method of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes  is used to account for income taxes 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on net operating loss carryforwards and differences between financial reporting and income tax bases of assets and liabilities 
deferred items are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences reverse 
deferred tax assets may be reduced by a valuation allowance to reflect the uncertainty associated with their ultimate realization 
any subsequently recognized tax benefits relating to the valuation allowance for deferred tax assets would be recorded as an income tax benefit in the statement of operations or a charge to additional paid in capital 
stock based compensation the company primarily grants qualified stock options for a fixed number of shares to employees with an exercise price equal to the fair market value of the shares at the date of grant 
the company has also issued restricted stock to key executives which vest over specified service periods 
the company has adopted the disclosure only provisions of sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation and therefore accounts for grants of stock options and restricted stock in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees 
accordingly  neurogen recognizes no compensation expense for the options when the option grants to employees have an exercise price equal to the fair market value at the date of grant and other relevant terms are fixed or determinable 
if compensation cost for the company s grant of stock awards was determined based on the fair value at the grant date consistent with the provisions of sfas no 
 the company s net loss and loss per share would be materially effected 
the company occasionally grants stock option awards to consultants 
such grants are accounted for pursuant to emerging issues task force eitf issue no 
 accounting for equity instruments that are issued to other than employees for acquiring  or in conjunction with selling  goods or services  and accordingly recognizes compensation expense equal to the fair value of such awards 
the fair value of each award is estimated using the black scholes model with certain weighted average assumptions described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
marketable securities the company invests in us government and corporate debt securities 
the fair value of these securities is subject to volatility and change 
the company considers its investment portfolio to be available for sale securities as defined in sfas no 
 accounting for certain investments in debt and equity securities 
marketable securities at december  and consisted of debt securities with maturities of three months to six years 
available for sale securities are carried at fair value with the unrealized gains losses reported as other comprehensive income 
realized gains and losses have been determined by the specific identification method and are included in investment income 
different classifications of the company s marketable securities pursuant to sfas no 
would possibly result in material impacts to the valuation of the securities and investment income 
results of operations results of operations may vary from period to period depending on numerous factors  including the timing of income earned under existing or future collaborative research agreements  technology transfer agreements or joint ventures  the progress of the company s partnered research and development projects  the size of the company s staff and the level of preclinical and clinical development spending on drug candidates in unpartnered programs 
neurogen believes its research and development costs may increase significantly over the next several years as its drug development programs progress 
in addition  general and administrative expenses would be expected to increase to support any expanded research and development activities 
years ended december   and the company s fiscal operating revenues increased percent to million from operating revenues of million 
the revenue increase consists of a million increase in license fee revenues and a million increase in research and development revenues 
the million increase in license fees is due to the recognition of a one time million payment from pfizer to satisfy all obligations from pfizer s use of the aidd technology as a part of the companies technology transfer agreement described below  a million increase in license fees recognized from aventis as part of the aventis agreement described below offset by a million decrease in aidd technology development and improvement services related to the pfizer technology transfer agreement 
the increase in research revenues is due to a million increase in research revenues from aventis to reflect a full year of research funding under the companies december collaboration agreement to develop drugs to treat depression and anxiety offset in part by a million decrease in revenues from pfizer due to the scheduled conclusion in december of the companies joint research collaboration on gaba based drugs 
fiscal operating revenues decreased percent from operating revenues of million 
this decrease was primarily due to a million decrease in research and development revenues resulting from a scheduled reduction in the company s staffing and related discovery research funding on gaba and neuropeptide y npy collaborative drug discovery programs with pfizer which comprised million of operating revenues in as compared to million in the recognition of license fee revenues pursuant to the pfizer technology transfer agreement also decreased from million in to million in research and development expenses  excluding non cash stock compensation charges  remained stable for fiscal at million as compared to million in  and increased percent in from million in external development costs related to potential drug candidates decreased from million in to million in in part due to the assumption by aventis commencing in december of the costs of developing potential drug candidates from the company s collaborative efforts 
this decrease was offset by an overall increase in the company s ongoing investment in scientific personnel and research supplies 
the increase in was primarily due to external development costs related to potential drug candidates which increased to million from million in the increase was also driven by the company s continued expansion of its aidd program for the discovery of new drug candidates 
research and development expenses represented percent  percent and percent of total operating expenses excluding non cash stock compensation charges for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company expenses all research and development costs as incurred 
while the company maintains a system to record the level of staffing time spent on its research and development projects  it does not maintain a historical cost accounting system with sufficient accuracy to reliably estimate its research and development costs on a specific project by project basis 
a significant portion of the company s research and development expenses such as laboratory supplies  travel  information systems and services and facilities costs benefit multiple projects and are not individually tracked to a specific project 
further  the company s staff timekeeping system does not account for differences in compensation costs between lower level technicians and more senior scientists 
general and administrative expenses  excluding non cash stock compensation charges  remained stable at million in as compared to million in  and increased percent in from million in the increase in was attributed to additional administrative and technical services and personnel to support the protection of neurogen s growing intellectual property estate and to support neurogen s expanding research pipeline 
total stock compensation expenses were million in compared to million in and million in the compensation expense is primarily composed of continuing non cash charges for grants of certain stock awards in  and to certain officers of the company 
the expense included non cash charges to income for grants of certain stock awards in and  as well as one time non cash charges totaling million for the modification of certain stock options held by two executive officers 
in the company recorded million in stock compensation expense for the vesting of restricted stock granted to certain employees in prior years 
a portion of the stock compensation charges those relating to the awards are variable and as a result may fluctuate significantly in the future 
other income was million in compared to million in and million in the decrease in is primarily due to an increase in interest expense of million associated with a million first mortgage debt financing the company entered into in december the remainder of the decrease in  as well as the decrease in  was due to a decrease in investment income due to lower overall returns on invested funds 
this was a result of lower average cash and marketable securities balances as well as a reduction in prevailing market interest rates 
for the years ended december  and  the company recorded connecticut income tax benefits of million and million  respectively  in the statement of operations 
the company recognized total income tax benefits of million and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  a portion of which has been recorded to additional paid in capital 
the benefits are the result of connecticut legislation which allowed certain companies to obtain cash refunds from the state of connecticut at an exchange rate of of their research and development credits in exchange for foregoing the carryforward of these credits into future tax years 
the company recognized a net loss of million for the year ended december   million for the year ended december   and million for the year ended december  the decrease in the net loss is primarily due to the increase in operating revenues 
the increase in the net loss is primarily due to the decrease in revenues and the increase in research and development and general and administrative expenses described above 
in december  the staff of the securities and exchange commission issued its staff accounting bulletin sab no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
sab no 
 as amended by sab no 
a and b  provides guidance on the measurement and timing of revenue recognition in financial statements of public companies 
sab no 
permits application of its guidance to be treated as a change in accounting principle in accordance with accounting principles board apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
the company adopted the guidance of sab no 
in the fourth quarter of  retroactive to january   and reflected a cumulative effect of change in accounting principle on prior years of million  related to timing of revenue recognition on certain non refundable up front payments previously recognized on a technology transfer agreement 
liquidity and capital resources at december  and  cash  cash equivalents including restricted cash of million in and marketable securities in the aggregate were million and million  respectively 
a total amount of million of the marketable securities at december  have maturities greater than one year 
however  the company can and may liquidate such investments prior to maturity to meet its strategic and or investment objectives 
the company s cash and other short term investment levels decreased ratably throughout due primarily to continued operating expenses  as well as purchases of property  plant and equipment of million and scheduled payments on outstanding loans described below of million 
this decrease was partially offset by the receipt of million in research funding and license fees and million in income tax benefits from the state of connecticut as described below 
the levels of cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities have fluctuated significantly in the past and are expected to do so in the future as a result of the factors described below 
the company plans to use its cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities for its research and development activities  working capital and general corporate purposes 
neurogen s cash requirements to date have been met by the proceeds of its equity financing activities  amounts received pursuant to collaborative research  licensing or technology transfer arrangements  certain debt arrangements and interest earned on invested funds 
the company s equity financing activities have included underwritten public offerings of common stock  private placement offerings of common stock and private sales of common stock in connection with collaborative research and licensing agreements 
total funding received from these financing activities was approximately million 
the company s expenditures have been primarily to fund research and development and general and administrative expenses and to construct and equip its research and development facilities 
the company is in the early stage of product development 
it has not derived any product revenues from product sales and does not expect to derive any product revenues for at least the next several years  if at all 
prior to deriving any such product revenues  the company expects to incur significant losses and negative cash flows which in the aggregate could exceed the company s existing cash resources 
to provide cash to fund its operations until such time as it achieves sustainable revenues  the company relies extensively on its ability to develop drug discovery programs of sufficient value to either partner the programs with pharmaceutical companies or raise capital through equity financings 
to the extent that drug candidates progress in the company s currently unpartnered programs  such as its program for the treatment of inflammatory disorders or earlier stage programs  such progress could lead to the opportunity to partner on terms which provide capital  revenues and cash flows to the company or the opportunity to raise capital through equity offerings 
if unpartnered programs do not progress or do not progress on schedule  such opportunities would be delayed or may not materialize at all 
to the extent that drug candidates progress in the company s partnered programs  such as the company s insomnia program partnered with pfizer or its depression and anxiety program partnered with aventis  such progress could result in milestone payments and additional research and development funding to the company under the respective collaboration agreements 
such progress could also provide the opportunity to raise capital through equity offerings 
if partnered programs do not progress or do not progress on schedule  such opportunities would be delayed or may not materialize at all 
lack of progress  scheduling delays or failures in any of the company s major programs could significantly reduce the company s levels of revenues  cash flows and cash available to fund its business 
it could also significantly increase the company s cost of capital and limit its ability to raise equity capital 
all of the company s compounds in development  whether in human clinical trials or not  will require significant additional research  development and testing before they can be commercialized 
furthermore  the scope  magnitude and timing of future research and development expenses  as well as anticipated project completion dates  are a series of steps  ranging from preclinical testing to clinical studies in humans 
each step in the process is typically more expensive than the previous step  but actual timing and cost for completion depends on the specific progress of each product being tested 
while the company cannot accurately predict the time required or the cost involved in commercializing any one of its candidates  new drug development typically takes many years and tens or hundreds of millions of dollars 
in addition  developing new drugs is an extremely uncertain process where most candidates fail and uncertain developments such as clinical or regulatory delays  side effects  undesirable drug properties or ineffectiveness of a drug candidate would slow or prevent the development of a product 
if we or our partners are unable to commercialize one or more of our drug products  we will never achieve product revenues and may eventually be unable to continue our operations 
this result would cause our shareholders to lose all or a substantial portion of their investment 
the debt agreements entered into by the company to date include the commercial term mortgage loan financing in december with webster bank  and a construction loan entered into in october with connecticut innovations  inc cii 
total proceeds received under these agreements were million  which are repayable through monthly installments over a maximum term of years  bearing various interest rates which approximated from through of these amounts received  million remained outstanding as of december  an approximate aggregate amount of million is due and payable in each of the next five years 
thereafter  approximately million is payable in regular installments until the scheduled maturity dates  including a balloon payment of million on the mortgage loan upon maturity in december the loan with cii contains certain subjective acceleration clauses  which upon occurrence of certain events  may cause amounts due under the agreement to become immediately due and payable 
the company has no indication that it is in default of any such clauses and therefore has classified its debt based on the dates regular payments are due 
as of december   neurogen is not engaged in any significant lease or capital expenditure commitments 
in october  as a part of its operational excellence program  neurogen reorganized certain departments and eliminated employee positions  representing approximately of its total workforce 
the company recorded a charge of approximately million in the fourth quarter of for employee termination costs  such as severance pay  continuation of benefits and personal outplacement support 
restructuring payments of a minimal amount are expected to end in the first quarter of neurogen anticipates that under the restructured operating program  its current cash balance  as supplemented by research funding pursuant to its collaborative research agreement with aventis  will be sufficient to fund its current and planned operations into at least early however  neurogen s funding requirements may change and will depend upon numerous factors  including but not limited to the progress of the company s research and development programs  the timing and results of preclinical testing and clinical studies  the timing of regulatory approvals  technological advances  determinations as to the commercial potential of its proposed products  the status of competitive products and the ability of the company to establish and maintain collaborative arrangements with others for the purpose of funding certain research and development programs  conducting clinical studies  obtaining regulatory approvals and  if such approvals are obtained  manufacturing and marketing products 
many of these factors could significantly increase the company s expenses and use of cash 
the company anticipates that it may augment its cash balance through financing transactions  including the issuance of debt or equity securities and further corporate alliances 
the company has filed an s registration statement which became effective in february  under which the company may issue debt  common or preferred stock or warrants of up to million in total financing within two years of the effective date 
no assurances can be given that adequate levels of additional funding can be obtained on favorable terms  if at all 
as of december   the company had approximately million and million of net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards  respectively  available for federal income tax purposes  which expire in the years through the company also had approximately million and million of connecticut state tax net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards  respectively  which expire in the years through in september  the company applied to exchange connecticut research and development credits for cash proceeds under connecticut tax law provisions effective at that time as mentioned above  resulting in the receipt of a million payment from the state of connecticut in november neurogen also received a payment of million in april for the exchange of research and development credits 
because of change in ownership provisions of the tax reform act of  the company s utilization of its net operating loss and research and development credit carryforwards may be subject to an annual limitation in future periods 
collaborative research agreements in december  neurogen entered into a collaboration and license agreement with aventis pursuant to which aventis made an initial payment of million and agreed  among other things  to fund a specified level of resources for three years for neurogen s program for the discovery and research of crf receptor based drugs for a broad range of applications  including the therapeutic treatment of depression and anxiety disorders 
aventis has the option to extend the discovery and research effort for up to an additional two years or terminate the collaboration prior to its scheduled conclusion and transfer all rights to the collaborative program to neurogen 
as of december   the company has received million of research funding from aventis 
neurogen is also eligible to receive milestone payments if certain compound discovery  product development or regulatory objectives are achieved subject to the collaboration 
in return  aventis received the exclusive worldwide rights to develop  manufacture and market collaboration drugs that act through the crf receptor  for all therapeutic indications for which the drugs may be used 
aventis will pay neurogen royalties based upon net sales levels  if any  for collaboration products 
also under the agreement  aventis is responsible for funding the cost of development  including clinical trials  manufacturing and marketing of collaboration products  if any 
in june  neurogen and pfizer entered into the pfizer technology transfer agreement 
under the terms of this agreement  pfizer agreed to pay neurogen up to a total of million over a three year period for the licensing and transfer to pfizer of certain of neurogen s aidd technologies for the discovery of new drugs  along with the installation of an aidd system 
additional payments were also possible upon pfizer s successful utilization of this technology 
pfizer received a non exclusive license to certain aidd intellectual property and the right to employ this technology in its own drug discovery programs 
as of december   pfizer had provided million pursuant to the pfizer technology transfer agreement  which terminated on schedule in june total fees include a million one time payment in december to satisfy all obligations from pfizer s use of the aidd technology 
recently issued accounting pronouncements in august  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
sfas no 
supercedes sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  in that it excludes goodwill from its impairment scope and allows for different approaches in cash flow estimation 
however  sfas no 
retains the fundamental provisions of sfas no 
for recognition and measurement of the impairment of a long lived assets to be held and used and b long lived assets to be disposed of other than by sale 
neurogen adopted the provisions of sfas no 
as of january  the implementation of this standard did not have any impact on the company s results of operations and financial position 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and nullifies eitf issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the provisions of sfas no 
are effective for exit or disposal activities initiated after december  however  as encouraged in the statement  the company has early adopted sfas no 
and has applied its respective provisions to the exit activity undertaken in described in note to the consolidated financial statements 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure 
sfas no 
amends sfas no 
to address alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change from the intrinsic to the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
the statement also amends certain disclosure provisions in sfas no 
neurogen continues to utilize the intrinsic value method to account for stock based employee compensation 
however  the disclosure provisions of sfas no 
have been implemented in the consolidated financial statements 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued fin no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others  which elaborates on the disclosures to be made by a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under certain guarantees that it has issued 
the company has indemnification agreements with three employees as of december  for contingent payments which may be required under provisions that exist in such employees employment agreements with prior employers 
the maximum amount of this potential obligation is approximately million  however the company believes the likelihood of payment of any amounts under such indemnifications is remote 
in january  the financial accounting standards board issued eitf issue no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf addresses  for arrangements with multiple deliverables  how the arrangement consideration should be measured  whether the arrangement should be divided into separate units of accounting and how the arrangement consideration should be allocated among the separate units of accounting 
the guidance in eitf is effective for revenue arrangements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june   and therefore does not have any impact on the consolidated financial statements 
the consensus in this eitf pronouncement may affect how the company recognizes revenue under future collaboration and technology transfer arrangements since these often include multiple elements such as non refundable upfront fees  ongoing payments for specified levels of staffing for research and milestone payments 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
the company s investment portfolio includes investment grade debt instruments 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk  and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration and conservative nature of these instruments  the company does not believe that it has a material exposure to interest rate risk 
additionally  funds available from investment activities are dependent upon available investment rates 
these funds may be higher or lower than anticipated due to interest rate volatility 
capital market risk 
the company currently has no product revenues and is dependent on funds raised through other sources 
one source of funding is through further equity offerings 
the ability of the company to raise funds in this manner is dependent upon capital market forces affecting the stock price of the company
