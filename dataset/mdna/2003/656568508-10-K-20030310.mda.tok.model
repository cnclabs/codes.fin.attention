nortel networks limited is our principal direct operating subsidiary 
nortel networks corporation holds all of nortel networks limited s outstanding common shares but none of its outstanding preferred shares 
developments in business segments re organizations during the third quarter of  we changed the way we managed our business to streamline and focus more directly on our customers in our four core business areas wireless networks  enterprise networks formerly part of metro and enterprise networks  wireline networks formerly part of metro and enterprise networks  and optical networks formerly named optical long haul networks 
during the second quarter of  we shifted the accountability for the metro optical portion of metro and enterprise networks into optical networks 
all financial information has been restated to reflect these re organizations 
optical networks on may   we announced plans to further realign our optical networks segment  including optical components  as we do not expect a meaningful recovery in the long haul optical market before early as part of this realignment  we sold certain optical components assets to bookham technology plc  or bookham  in november for shares  warrants  debt and cash consideration resulting in a gain of the transaction included a minimum purchase commitment of the terms of the commitment require us to purchase approximately of product from bookham prior to march  and to make a cash payment to bookham for a portion of any shortfall in the purchase commitment

credit facilities on december   we announced amendments to our existing security agreements to facilitate our future financial flexibility 
these security agreements pledged substantially all of nortel networks limited s assets in favor of certain lenders and the holders of our public debt 
as part of the amendments  we terminated the  april day revolving facilities that would have expired in april also  on december   our  december day credit facilities expired and were not extended 
as of december   our april five year credit facilities remained available and undrawn 
see available credit and support facilities for additional details 
debt rating downgrades on april   moody s investor services  inc lowered nortel networks limited s senior long term debt rating below investment grade to ba and on november   lowered the rating from ba to b with a negative outlook 
on april   standard poor s ratings service lowered nortel networks limited s credit rating to below investment grade to bb and on september   lowered the rating from bb to b with a negative outlook 
as a result of the april debt rating downgrades  various liens  pledges and guarantees became effective under certain credit and security agreements entered into by nortel networks limited and several of its subsidiaries 
our obligations under our public debt and our support facility entered into with export development canada  or edc  on february  are secured by these liens  pledges and guarantees 
further  any amounts drawn under our april five year credit facilities would also be secured by these liens  pledges and guarantees

deferred income taxes as part of our quarterly review procedures  we performed an evaluation of the recoverability of our deferred income tax assets 
in the third quarter of  in addition to recording a write down of our existing deferred tax asset  we began recording full valuation allowances against the benefit of our quarterly losses 
in  we recorded a net income tax benefit of on a pre tax loss of  our gross income tax valuation allowances in were  including certain additional income tax valuation allowances of if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected  additional tax valuation allowances may be required for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets 
see income tax benefit for additional information 
employee benefit plans in the fourth quarter of  we recorded a non cash charge of after tax to shareholders equity related to the increase in the minimum required recognizable deficit associated with our registered defined benefit pension plans 
this charge was the result of the negative impact that changes in global capital markets and interest rates have had on our pension plan assets and obligations 
during  we made in required cash contributions to our registered defined benefit pension plans as well as additional voluntary contributions of in  we expect required cash contributions under applicable legislation to be similar to those made in for additional information on our registered defined benefit pension plans  see application of critical accounting policies 
restructuring and asset write downs we recorded special charges of  in and  in these charges related to restructuring activities and write downs of goodwill and other assets 
the special charges relating to restructuring were associated with our work plan to streamline operations and activities around core markets and leadership strategies 
we began implementing our work plan in and it has continued throughout the goodwill write down in related to a fair value impairment in our optical networks segment 
we expect that additional charges will be required in related to our remaining announced workforce reductions and related charges

table of contents common shares on september   we announced our plan to present a proposal to our shareholders for a consolidation of our outstanding common shares  also known as a reverse stock split  at our annual and special shareholders meeting 
on february   we announced that we would ask our shareholders to authorize our board of directors to implement a consolidation of our common shares  at their sole discretion  at any time prior to april  if a consolidation is determined to be in the best interests of nortel networks and its shareholders  our board of directors will select a consolidation ratio within the range of one post consolidation common share for every five pre consolidation common shares to one post consolidation common share for every ten pre consolidation common shares 
stock options we adopted fair value accounting for new grants of stock options beginning january  as a result  all stock option grants in and beyond will be expensed over the stock option vesting period based on the fair value at the date the options are granted 
if we were to grant options in at a similar level to  the expected impact on net earnings loss per share would be approximately per common share for for additional information  see significant accounting policies in note t of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
shareholder rights plan on february   we announced that we will be seeking shareholder approval at our annual and special shareholders meeting for reconfirmation and amendment of our shareholder rights plan which was originally approved by shareholders in april under the rights plan  we issue one right for each common share outstanding 
these rights become exercisable upon the occurrence of certain events associated with an unsolicited takeover bid

table of contents geographic revenues for the years ended december  vs vs change change change change united states emea a canada other regions consolidated b a the europe  middle east and africa region emea b revenues by geographic regions are based on the location of the customer consolidated revenues compared to in  the industry continued to experience a significant adjustment which began in following a period of rapid infrastructure build out and strong economic growth in and  we saw a continued tightening in the global capital markets and slowdown in the industry throughout our revenues declined sequentially in due to lower capital spending by industry participants and substantially less demand for our products and services as customers focused on maximizing their return on invested capital 
during  we continued to see these constraints on capital expenditures by our customers 
also  excess network capacity continued to exist in the industry 
in addition  we saw continuing consolidation of service providers within the industry 
this environment created a change in our customers focus from building new networks to conserving capital  decreasing their debt levels  reducing costs and or increasing the capacity utilization rates and efficiency of existing networks 
as a result  our consolidated revenues declined compared to from a geographic perspective  we experienced considerable declines across all regions in compared to compared to the significant adjustment in the industry in  which was initially felt and was most severe in the united states  also impacted the europe  middle east and africa region  or emea  the caribbean and latin america region  or cala  and the asia pacific region during revenues in declined compared to revenues also declined substantially across all regions  with the exception of the asia pacific region 
revenues in the asia pacific region grew in compared to due to considerable growth in the first half of this growth was the result of expansion in the people s republic of china as contracts entered into during were completed 
however  we experienced a substantial sequential decline in the second half of in the asia pacific region 
emea experienced a substantial sequential decline in the second quarter of and significant sequential declines in the third and fourth quarters of the decline in cala reflected substantial sequential declines in the second and third quarters of the united states was essentially flat sequentially in the fourth quarter of following three quarters of substantial sequential declines in entering  we expect overall spending in the telecommunications equipment market to be down modestly in compared to however  we cannot predict the economic impact of acts of war or terrorism on the market 
we expect to see continued constraints on capital spending by customers due to our customers realigning their investment levels with their current levels of revenue and returns  and focusing on maximizing their return on invested capital  the high debt levels of many service providers  the financial difficulties of certain service providers  
table of contents a lack of available funding from the capital markets  excess network assets  excess and shared bandwidth capacity  and the compounding impact of economic and geopolitical concerns 
also  we expect to experience increased pricing pressures on sales of our products as a result of increased competition 
anticipating cautious spending by our customers in the near term and the seasonal softness traditionally typical of the first quarter  we expect that revenues in the first quarter of will be lower than revenues in the fourth quarter of it is difficult to predict the duration of the current industry adjustment  as growth in industry spending is not expected to occur until global economic and financial concerns have subsided 
market visibility remains limited and we do not expect that our results of operations for any quarter will necessarily be consistent with our quarterly historical profile or indicative of our expected results in future quarters 
see forward looking statements for factors that may affect our revenues 
wireless networks compared to the decline in wireless networks revenues in compared to was primarily due to a continued deterioration in wireless service providers financial condition and subscriber growth and increased competition for customers by service providers which has resulted in the decision of many wireless service providers to delay capital expenditures 
time division multiple access  or tdma  revenues declined substantially in compared to primarily due to a substantial decline in the united states as customers migrated from tdma to code division multiple access  or cdma  and global system for mobile communications  or gsm  technologies as a result of tdma technology and networks being in its maturity stage 
tdma revenues continued to be a smaller portion of wireless networks in compared to also cdma revenues declined in compared to continued capital spending constraints and financial difficulties experienced by our customers globally contributed to both the cdma and tdma revenue declines 
in  we continued to experience significant pricing pressures on our cdma and tdma technologies in the united states and cala resulting from the increased competition for customers 
overall gsm revenues  which includes general packet radio standard  or gprs  and enhanced data rates for global evolution  or edge  g technologies  declined substantially in compared to due to substantial declines in emea and the asia pacific region 
these substantial declines were primarily due to a continued deterioration in wireless service providers financial condition and subscriber growth  and delays in capital expenditures 
also in the asia pacific region  customers began to deploy cdma technology solutions as they migrated away from the maturing gsm technologies 
this shift in technology focus contributed to the substantial decline in gsm revenues in the asia pacific region 
in  universal mobile telecommunications systems  or umts  revenues continued to be an insignificant portion of overall wireless networks revenues 
while the first commercial launches in the industry did take place in emea and the asia pacific region  technology issues associated with third generation  or g  handsets contributed to delays in larger deployments of g networks in also  some of our g customers in emea incurred significant costs in associated with licensing fees  which  along with their continued financial difficulties  limited their spending on network deployments 
as a result  g network deployments suffered delays in emea in from a geographic perspective  the decrease in wireless networks revenues in compared to was primarily due to a decline in revenues in the asia pacific region  decline in revenues in the united states  decline in revenues in emea  and decline in revenues in cala 

table of contents compared to the increase in wireless networks revenues in compared to was primarily due to a substantial increase in revenues in the first half of  driven by growth in the united states and the asia pacific region as our major customers continued their network expansion programs 
subsequently  wireless networks revenues declined in the second half of compared to as a result of deterioration in our customers financial condition  our providing limited  incremental customer financing as a result of the market conditions and the decision of many wireless service providers to delay certain capital expenditures 
cdma revenues increased substantially in compared to primarily due to significant growth in cdma technology in the asia pacific region  driven by new network deployments 
this significant growth was offset by the global decline in tdma technology caused by pricing pressures and this technology reaching its maturity stage 
gsm revenues decreased substantially in compared to primarily due to a substantial decline in emea and a significant decline in the asia pacific region 
the substantial decline in emea was due to deterioration in our wireless service providers financial condition and subscriber growth  and reductions in capital spending as many customers completed their initial network deployments in in the asia pacific region  the significant decline was due to a reduction in capital expenditures by some of our wireless customers 
revenues in the united states and cala increased in compared to as new customers began network deployments 
in  the united states and cala represented a larger proportion of gsm and gprs revenues compared to umts revenues were not a significant portion of wireless networks in umts revenues increased substantially in compared to primarily due to a substantial increase in emea as some of our customers began their g network deployments 
from a geographic perspective  the increase in wireless networks revenues in compared to was primarily due to a increase in revenues in the united states  and increase in revenues in the asia pacific region  partially offset by decline in revenues in cala  and decline in revenues in emea 
in  wireless networks revenues continued to be primarily generated by sales of cdma and gsm technologies 
in  tdma revenues are expected to decline 
overall gsm sales are also expected to decline as technology transitions from gsm to gprs and edge 
in  our cdma g and umts technology sales are expected to grow and represent a larger proportion of wireless networks revenues as g technologies are expected to gain a greater foothold in the market due to increased wireless data traffic and requirements for greater wireless spectrum efficiency 
also  we expect to experience increased pricing pressures on sales of wireless networks products as a result of increased competition 
as with the rest of the industry  our wireless customers are experiencing significant pressure and are adapting to a new  more stringent spending environment due to the lack of financing and the overall industry decline 
we anticipate a reduction in global capital expenditures for wireless operators in and  compared to  but cannot predict the complete impact 
we also expect to see continued consolidation in this marketplace  including a reduction in the number of service providers in certain regions due to competition and or adjustments in deployment plans and schedules 
in addition  the timing of the anticipated change in revenue mix from the different wireless technologies has become increasingly difficult to predict as a result of the complexities and potential for delays in the implementation of umts network deployments 
all of these factors could adversely affect our wireless networks revenues in the future 

table of contents enterprise networks compared to the reduction in enterprise networks revenues in compared to was primarily a result of enterprise customers continuing to reduce their spending due to the ongoing industry adjustment  the overall economic conditions and uncertainties surrounding the technology evolution of next generation products 
revenues from the circuit and packet voice portion of this segment declined significantly in compared to the significant decline was primarily due to reductions in customer spending in the united states and emea 
revenues for traditional circuit switching products did begin to show signs of improvement in the united states in the second half of after experiencing sequential quarterly reductions during and the first half of in  traditional circuit switching also continued its evolution towards internet protocol  or ip  telephony  as reliability and quality of service concerns  traditionally associated with voice over packet solutions  were reduced 
regardless  customers remained cautious in with respect to their investment decisions due to uncertainties surrounding the migration to packet voice solutions 
the data networking and security portion of this segment experienced substantial declines in compared to the substantial decrease in revenues was primarily due to customer spending constraints and a decline in demand for mature products across all regions 
pricing pressures continued in in the data networking and security portion of this segment as we experienced continued significant competition for enterprise customers 
from a geographic perspective  the decline in enterprise networks revenues in compared to was primarily due to a decline in revenues in the united states  decline in revenues in emea  and decline in revenues in the asia pacific region 
compared to the decline in revenues in compared to was primarily due to the significant industry adjustment and the impact this adjustment had on spending by our enterprise customers 
the substantial decrease in sales of the circuit and packet voice portion of this segment was primarily the result of reduced demand in the enterprise market due to the significant industry adjustment  industry consolidation  tightened capital markets and our circuit switching products reaching their maturity stage 
the significant decline in sales of the data networking and security portion of this segment was primarily due to a decline in demand for mature products  compounded by the continued industry adjustment as customers delayed their purchase of next generation products 
from a geographic perspective  the decline in enterprise networks revenues in compared to was primarily due to a decline in revenues in the united states  decline in revenues in canada  and decline in revenues in cala  partially offset by increase in revenues in emea 

table of contents looking ahead  we anticipate that communications networks will increase the use of voice over packet technologies 
we expect that data  voice and multimedia communications technologies will continue to converge  and enterprises will look for ways to maximize the effectiveness of their existing networks while reducing ongoing capital expenditures and operating costs 
however  the timing of this progression is unclear and we expect that the continuing industry adjustment will have a negative impact on the level of spending by our enterprise customers 
wireline networks compared to the decline in wireline networks revenues in compared to was primarily due to a substantial reduction in capital spending by our service provider customers 
the considerable decline in the circuit and packet voice portion of this segment was the result of continued reduced demand in the local exchange and interexchange carrier markets due to the significant industry adjustment  including industry consolidation and tightened capital markets  and the decline in demand for traditional circuit switching products 
during  many of our service provider customers continued to delay their investment decisions on our packet voice solutions due to the technology evolution uncertainty in the industry 
in  we continued to experience significant pricing pressures on our traditional circuit switching products due to the increased competition for service provider customers 
the considerable decline in revenues in the data networking and security portion of this segment was primarily due to a decline in demand for mature products  compounded by the ongoing industry adjustment as our service provider customers  in all regions  continued to reduce their capital expenditures 
from a geographic perspective  the decline in wireline networks revenues in compared to was primarily due to a decline in revenues in the united states  decline in revenues in emea  decline in revenues in the asia pacific region  and decline in revenues in canada 
compared to the decline in revenues in compared to was due to a substantial decline in sales of the circuit and packet voice portion of this segment and a significant decline in the data networking and security portion of this segment 
the substantial decrease in sales in the circuit and packet voice portion of this segment was primarily the result of reduced demand in the interexchange carrier market due to the significant industry adjustment  industry consolidation  tightened capital markets and the maturing of circuit switching products 
the significant decline in sales in the data networking and security portion of this segment was primarily due to a decline in demand for mature products  compounded by the continued industry adjustment as customers delayed the purchase of next generation products 
from a geographic perspective  the decline in wireline networks revenues was primarily due to a decline in revenues in the united states  decline in emea  and decline in canada 

table of contents in the future  we anticipate that service providers will increase the use of packet based technologies in their communications networks as they look for ways to optimize their existing networks and offer new revenue generating services while controlling capital expenditures and operating costs 
however  the timing of this transition is unclear 
we expect that the continuing industry adjustment  continuing industry consolidation and reduction in capital spending by our customers will have a negative impact on the level of spending by our service provider customers and could adversely affect wireline networks revenues in the future 
optical networks compared to the decline in optical networks revenues in compared to was primarily the result of substantial reductions in capital spending by our major united states and emea customers 
our major customers in the long haul portion of this segment focused on maximizing return on invested capital by increasing the capacity utilization rates and efficiency of existing networks 
revenues in the optical long haul portion of the segment declined substantially in compared to the considerable decline was primarily due to the continued industry adjustment  including industry consolidation  continued capital spending constraints and  to a lesser extent  the large redeployment of assets that occurred in and continued throughout the spending constraints and redeployment of assets were caused primarily by significant excess inventories which resulted in significant pricing pressures 
revenues in the metro optical portion of the segment are primarily driven by demand for enterprise connectivity and storage solutions 
the substantial decline in revenue in the metro optical portion of the segment in compared to was primarily due to a decline in demand for mature products 
this decline was compounded by the ongoing industry adjustment as customers continued to focus on optimizing existing networks and delayed the deployment of next generation products 
industry consolidation also contributed to the reduction in service provider capital spending during and the current generation of metro products  namely  the optera metro family of products were the key products contributing to revenue in and accounted for a substantial portion of the overall optical networks revenues 
revenue in the metro optical portion of the segment increased as a percentage of total optical networks revenue in compared to from a geographic perspective  the decline in optical networks revenues in compared to was primarily due to a decline in revenues in the united states  decline in revenues in emea  decline in revenues in the asia pacific region  and decline in revenues in cala 
compared to the decline in revenues in compared to was primarily the result of substantial reductions in capital spending  primarily by our major united states customers 
our major customers in the long haul portion of this segment focused on maximizing return on invested capital by increasing the capacity utilization rates and efficiency of existing networks 
our revenues in the first quarter of reflected the then in process network build outs that had begun in however  when the industry began experiencing a significant adjustment and the capital markets tightened  our customers reduced their purchases significantly and focused on reducing inventory levels to complete existing network build outs and on improving the efficiency of existing networks 
the continuing industry consolidation in also contributed to the reduction in service provider capital spending during overall  a large redeployment of assets occurred in this segment of the industry in primarily due to significant excess inventories 
this redeployment  in conjunction with the continuing industry consolidation  resulted in significant pricing pressures in due to the severe reduction  in number and size  of 
table of contents new network build outs during  we experienced a substantial decline in the long haul portion of this segment compared to the substantial decline in sales of the metro optical portion of this segment in compared to was primarily due to a decrease in sales volumes of mature optical products that have a metropolitan or regional application 
from a geographic perspective  the decline in optical networks revenues in compared to was primarily due to a decline in revenues in the united states  and decline in revenues in emea 
our major customers in the optical long haul portion of this segment remain focused on maximizing return on their invested capital by increasing the capacity utilization rates and efficiency of existing networks 
we expect that any additional capital spending by those customers will be increasingly directed to opportunities that enhance customer performance  revenue generation  and cost reduction in the near term 
we expect that customers in this portion of the segment will continue to focus on route by route activities  adding channels to existing networks  and interconnectivity and bandwidth as it is required in the short term 
further  we believe that building out networks for increased bandwidth will remain longer term projects 
revenues in the optical long haul portion of the segment are primarily based on network build outs and  consequently  generally include a number of long haul products packaged together in an end to end solution 
as a result  almost all products within this portion of the segment are generally affected in the same manner as fluctuations in the needs of our customers typically result in corresponding increases or decreases in overall optical long haul revenue 
in the metro optical portion of this segment  we expect to see an increase in demand for metro dense wavelength division multiplexing  or metro dwdm  as our customers begin to deploy inter office fiber infrastructure 
as a result  we expect that the metro optical portion of this segment will continue to become a larger percentage of the overall optical networks revenues 
due to the severe reduction  in number and size  of new optical long haul network build outs and due to the nature of the optical long haul portion of this segment  we do not expect a meaningful recovery in the optical long haul market before early also  we anticipate that pricing pressures on optical system vendors will continue due to intense competition  large inventories and a diminished market 
as a result  we expect that our optical networks revenues will decline in and will be one of our last segments to recover from the significant industry adjustment

after adjusting for these incremental costs  the substantial increase in gross profit in was primarily due to improvements in our cost structure as we have reduced inventory levels to more closely reflect our sales volume and received more favorable supplier pricing in gross profit increased even though we experienced substantial pricing pressures in 
table of contents gross profit decreased substantially in compared to due to substantial declines in revenues and gross margin 
the overall decrease in gross margin was primarily due to approximately  of incremental charges  related to the entire supply chain and contract and customer settlement costs  resulting from the significant industry adjustment  our fixed cost structure that was not reflective of the lower sales volumes in  pricing pressures across certain products and services  primarily in optical networks  resulting from increased competition  and shifts in the geographic mix of sales from the united states to emea and the asia pacific region  where we generally earn lower gross margins

this write down occurred during the third quarter from our review of our investment portfolio  and was due to a change in our strategic focus relative to certain minority investments  as well as an other than temporary decline in carrying values caused by the continued significant downturn in both the industry and economic environment 
public company investments were generally written down against earnings to their current market value

therefore  although disposal activities continue beyond the one year period  we continue to present the access solutions operations as discontinued operations in the accompanying consolidated financial statements

table of contents application of critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting policies  generally accepted in the united states  which require us to make significant estimates and assumptions 
we believe that the following accounting policies may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity in their application and represent our critical accounting policies 
the application of these policies requires us to make subjective and objective judgments 
in general  any changes in estimates or assumptions relating to revenue recognition  provisions for receivables  provisions for inventory and other contingencies excluding legal contingencies are directly reflected in the results of our reportable operating segments 
changes in estimates or assumptions pertaining to our tax asset valuations  our pension and post retirement benefits and our legal contingencies are generally not reflected in our reportable operating segments  but are reflected on a consolidated basis 
we have discussed the application of these critical accounting policies with the audit committee of our board of directors 
revenue recognition our material revenue streams are the result of a wide range of activities  from custom design and installation over a long period of time to pack and ship  with many variations in between 
our networking solutions also cover a broad range of technologies and are offered on a global basis 
as a result  our revenue recognition policies can differ depending on the level of customization within the solution and the contractual terms with the customer 
newer technologies within one of our reporting segments may also have different revenue recognition policies  depending on  among other factors  the specific performance and acceptance criteria within the applicable contract 
therefore  management must use judgment in determining how to apply the current accounting standards and interpretations  not only based on the networking solution  but also within networking solutions based on reviewing the level of customization and contractual terms with the customer 
as a result  our revenues may fluctuate from period to period based on the mix of solutions sold and in which geographic region they are sold 
the collectibility of trade and notes receivables is also critical in determining whether revenue should be recognized  especially considering the current economic environment within our industry 
as part of the revenue recognition process  we determine whether trade or notes receivables are reasonably assured of collection and whether there has been deterioration in the credit quality of our customers that could result in our inability to collect the receivables 
we will defer revenue and related costs if we are uncertain as to whether we will be able to collect the receivable 
when we determine that collection of the receivable is unlikely  we will defer revenue but continue to recognize any related costs 
when we determine that a loss exists on a particular contract  we will recognize the loss immediately 
for further information on our revenue recognition policies relating to our material revenue streams  you should also refer to note d of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
provisions for receivables in establishing the appropriate provisions for trade  notes and long term receivables due from customers  we make assumptions with respect to their future collectibility 
our assumptions are based on an individual assessment of a customer s credit quality as well as subjective factors and trends  including the aging of receivable balances 
generally  these individual credit assessments occur prior to the inception of the credit exposure and at regular reviews during the life of the exposure and consider a customer s ability to meet and sustain their financial commitments  a customer s current and projected financial condition  the positive or negative effects of the current and projected industry outlook  and the economy in general 

table of contents once we consider all of these individual factors  we make a determination as to the probability of default 
an appropriate provision is then made  which takes into consideration the severity of the likely loss on the outstanding receivable balance based on our experience in collecting these amounts 
in addition to these individual assessments  in general  outstanding trade accounts receivable amounts that are greater than days are fully provisioned for and amounts greater than days are provisioned for 
a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of any of the above mentioned conditions could result in bad debts in excess of the provisions determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date 
we recorded receivable provisions  relating to continuing operations  of in   in and in the following table summarizes our accounts receivable and long term receivable balances and related reserves of our continuing operations as at december  gross accounts receivable related reserves net accounts receivable accounts receivable reserves as a percentage of gross accounts receivables gross long term receivables related reserves net long term receivables long term receivable reserves as a percentage of long term receivables our level of reserves for both accounts receivable and long term receivables fluctuate depending on all of the factors mentioned above 
in and  significant provisions have been recorded  however  due to the current market conditions and the creditworthiness of some of our customers  it is difficult to determine the extent to which this trend will continue in the future 
provisions for inventory management must make estimates about the future customer demand for our products when establishing the appropriate provisions for inventory 
when making these estimates  we consider general economic conditions and growth prospects within our customers ultimate marketplace  and the market acceptance of our current and pending products 
these judgments must be made in the context of our customers shifting technology needs and changes in the geographic mix of our customers 
with respect to our provisioning policy  in general  we fully reserve for surplus inventory in excess of our day demand forecast or that we deem to be obsolete 
generally  our inventory provisions have an inverse relationship with the projected demand for our products 
for example  our provisions usually increase as projected demand decreases due to adverse changes in the conditions mentioned above 
we have experienced significant changes in required reserves in recent periods due to changes in strategic direction  such as discontinuances of product lines  as well as declining market conditions 
a misinterpretation or misunderstanding of any of these conditions could result in inventory losses in excess of the provisions determined to be appropriate as of the balance sheet date 
we recorded inventory provisions and other provisions related to our contract manufacturers and suppliers  relating to continuing operations  of in   in and in the following table summarizes our inventory balances and related reserves of our continuing operations 
table of contents as at december  gross inventory related reserves net inventory inventory reserves as a percentage of gross inventory other reserves for claims related to our contract manufacturers and suppliers a a included in other accrued liabilities and relating to cancellation charges  inventory in excess of future demand  and for the settlement of certain other claims in  we believe that we will continue to see constraints on capital expenditures by our customers 
as a result  we will continue to closely monitor our inventory reserves to ensure that our provisions appropriately reflect the current market conditions  however  the inventory provisions we have recorded in the past may not be reflective of those in future quarters 
tax asset valuation we currently have deferred tax assets resulting from net operating loss carryforwards  tax credit carryforwards  and deductible temporary differences  all of which will reduce taxable income in the future 
we assess the realization of these deferred tax assets quarterly to determine whether an income tax valuation allowance is required 
based on available evidence  both positive and negative  we determine whether it is more likely than not that all or a portion of the remaining net deferred tax assets will be realized 
the main factors that we consider include future earnings potential determined through the use of internal forecasts  cumulative losses in recent years  history of loss carryforwards and other tax assets expiring  the carryforward period associated with the deferred tax assets  and the nature of the income that can be used to realize the deferred tax asset 
if it is our belief that it is more likely than not that some portion of these assets will not be realized  an income tax valuation allowance is recorded 
gross income tax valuation allowances were  in  including certain additional income tax valuation allowances of we assessed positive evidence including forecasts of future taxable income to support realization of the net deferred tax assets  and negative evidence including our eight consecutive quarters of tax losses  and concluded that it was more likely than not  that certain additional tax valuation allowances of were required 
if market conditions improve and future results of operations exceed our current expectations  our existing tax valuation allowances may be adjusted  resulting in future tax benefits 
alternatively  if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that some or all of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
goodwill valuation commencing january   we test goodwill for possible impairment on an annual basis and at any other time if an event occurs or circumstances change that would more likely than not reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
circumstances that could trigger an impairment test include  but are not limited to a significant adverse change in legal factors or in the business climate  an adverse action or assessment by a regulator  
table of contents unanticipated competition  loss of key personnel  the likelihood that a reporting unit or a significant portion of a reporting unit will be sold or disposed of  results of testing for recoverability of a significant asset group within a reporting unit  and or the recognition of a goodwill impairment loss in the financial statements of a subsidiary that is a component of a reporting unit 
the determination as to whether a write down of goodwill is necessary involves significant judgment based on the short term and long term projections of the future performance of the reporting unit to which the goodwill is attributed 
the assumptions supporting the estimated future cash flows of the reporting unit  including the discount rate used and estimated terminal value reflect our best estimates 
in  we incurred a goodwill write down of as a result of the continued decline in both our overall market value generally and within optical networks specifically  we evaluated the goodwill associated with the businesses within optical networks for potential impairment 
the conclusion of those evaluations was that the fair value associated with the businesses within optical networks could no longer support the carrying value of the remaining goodwill associated with them 
fair value was estimated using the expected present value of discounted future cash flows of these businesses 
the discount rate used ranged from to and the terminal values were estimated based on terminal growth rates ranging from to 
in  we incurred a goodwill write down of  in  we performed an assessment of the carrying values of goodwill associated with our acquisitions 
the assessment during that period was performed in light of the significant negative industry and economic trends impacting our operations and expected future growth rates  and the adjustment of technology valuations 
the conclusion of our assessment was that the decline in market conditions within the industry was significant and other than temporary 
the write downs were primarily related to the goodwill within enterprise networks  optical networks and other 
fair value was determined based on discounted future cash flows for the businesses within these reportable segments that had separately distinguishable goodwill balances and whose operations had not yet been fully integrated 
the cash flow periods used were five years  the discount rate used was  and the terminal values were estimated based upon terminal growth rates ranging from to 
the discount rate was based on our weighted average cost of capital  adjusted for the risks associated with the operations 
in  we incurred a goodwill write down of related to certain operations in emea and as a result of a change in business mandate for those operations from a product focus to a focus on distribution channels 
for additional information on our goodwill write downs  see special charges in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
the carrying value of goodwill was  at december  and  at december  for more information on the goodwill amounts attributed to each reportable segment  you should refer to consolidated financial statement details in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
pension and post retirement benefits we maintain various pension and post retirement benefit plans for our employees in north america and the united kingdom 
these plans include significant pension and post retirement benefit obligations which are calculated based on actuarial valuations 
key assumptions are made in determining these obligations and related expenses  including expected rates of return on plan assets and discount rates 
for  the expected long term rate of return on plan assets used to estimate pension expenses was on a weighted average basis  which was the rate determined at september  the expenses for were based on a weighted average long term rate of return of 
the discount rate used to estimate the net pension obligations and expenses for were and respectively on a weighted average basis  compared to and respectively in the lower rates reflected the decline in global capital markets and interest rates 

table of contents the key assumptions used to estimate the post retirement costs for were an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of and a discount rate of and for the obligations and costs  respectively  both on a weighted average basis 
the expected long term rate of return on plan assets remained unchanged from the discount rates for the obligations and costs decreased from and respectively in due to the decline in global interest rates 
the difference between the expected long term rate of return on plan assets and the discount rate reported for the net pension obligations and expenses and the post retirement benefit obligations and costs is due to the weighted average calculation as a result of the number of countries in which we offer either pension or pension and post retirement benefits 
in developing these assumptions  we evaluated  among other things  input from our actuaries  expected long term market returns and current high quality bond rates 
plan assets are comprised primarily of common stocks  bonds  debentures  secured mortgages and property 
included in plan assets are common shares of nortel networks corporation with an aggregate market value of in in 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses are being recognized over approximately a year period  which represents the weighted average expected remaining service life of the employee group 
unrecognized actuarial gains and losses arise from several factors including experience and assumption changes in the obligations and from the difference between expected returns and actual returns on assets 
at the end of  we had unrecognized net actuarial losses of  which could result in an increase to pension expenses in future years depending on several factors  including whether such losses exceed the corridor in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions 
the estimated accumulated benefit obligations for the defined benefit plans exceeded the fair value of the plan assets at september  as a result of the negative impact that declines in global capital markets and interest rates had on our pension plan assets and obligations 
accordingly  we recorded a non cash charge of after tax to shareholders equity for the minimum pension liability 
a similar charge may be required in the future as the impact of changes in global capital markets and interest rates on the value of our pension plan assets and obligations is measured 
during  we made in required cash contributions to our registered defined benefit pension plans as well as additional voluntary contributions of in  we expect required cash contributions under applicable legislation to be similar to those made in  although global capital market and interest rate fluctuations could impact future funding requirements 
for  our expected rate of return on plan assets remains unchanged from for pension expenses and post retirement costs 
however  for  we lowered our discount rate approximately to on a weighted average basis for pension expenses and to on a weighted average basis for post retirement costs given the current global interest rates 
we will continue to evaluate our expected long term rates of return on plan assets and discount rates at least annually and make adjustments as necessary  which could change the pension and post retirement obligations and expenses in the future 
if the actual operation of the plans differs from the assumptions  additional contributions by us may be required 
if we are required to make significant contributions to fund the defined benefit plans  reported results could be materially and adversely affected and our cash flow available for other uses may be significantly reduced 
other contingencies we are subject to the possibility of various loss contingencies arising in the ordinary course of business 
as a result  we consider the likelihood of loss or impairment of an asset or the incurrence of a liability  as well as our ability to reasonably estimate the amount of loss  in determining loss contingencies 
we recognize a reserve for an estimated loss contingency when it is probable that an asset has been impaired or a liability has been incurred and the amount of loss can be reasonably estimated 
we regularly evaluate current information available to us to determine whether such accruals should be adjusted 
we are also subject to proceedings  lawsuits and other claims some of which may involve substantial dollar amounts  including proceedings under laws and government regulations related to securities  environmental  labor  product and other matters 
we are required to assess the likelihood of any adverse judgments or outcomes in these matters  as well as 
table of contents potential ranges of probable losses 
a determination of the amount of reserves required  if any  for these contingencies is based on an analysis of each individual issue 
the required reserves may change in the future due to new developments in each matter or changes in approach such as a change in settlement strategy in dealing with these matters 
we cannot determine whether these matters will  individually or collectively  have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition

at december   we had cash of  excluding of restricted cash 
we believe this cash will be sufficient to fund our current business model  manage our investments and meet our customer commitments for at least the next months 
however  if capital spending by service providers and other customers declines more significantly than we currently expect  we may be required to adjust our current business model 
as a result  our revenues and cash flows may be materially lower than we expect and we may be required to further reduce our capital expenditures and investments or take other measures in order to meet our cash requirements 
we may seek additional funds from liquidity generating transactions and other conventional sources of external financing which may include a variety of debt  convertible debt and or equity financings 
we cannot provide any assurance that our net cash requirements will be as we currently expect  that we will continue to have access to our credit facilities when and as needed  or that liquidity generating transactions or financings will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
cash flows used in operating activities were due to a net loss of  less an adjustment of  for non cash related items  plus a net cash inflow of from operating assets and liabilities 
the reduction in income tax was primarily due to the collection of  in income tax refunds during the period 
any future income tax payments are expected to be minimal versus historical levels until we utilize our available income tax loss carryforwards and tax credits 
the reduction in the remaining operating assets and liabilities was primarily due to the continued decline in sales volumes and the associated size of the business  as well as the utilization of certain contract manufacturer and supplier provisions and restructuring provisions 
cash flows used in investing activities were and were primarily due to an increase of in restricted cash held as cash collateral for certain customer bid and performance bonds and contracts  and expenditures for plant and equipment of these amounts were partially offset by proceeds on disposal of certain plant and equipment of  mainly related to the sale of certain real estate in the united kingdom  a net decrease of in our long term receivables  and net proceeds on the sale acquisition of investments and businesses of  primarily related to the sale of certain assets of our service commerce operation support system business

table of contents commitments and guarantees bid and performance related bonds we enter into bid and performance related bonds in connection with various contracts 
these contracts generally have terms ranging from two to five years 
performance related bonds generally have a term of about twelve months and are typically renewed  as required  over the term of the applicable contract 
bid bonds generally have a much shorter term than performance related bonds  depending on the length of the bid period for the applicable contract 
any potential payments that we would be required to make are related to our performance under the applicable contract 
the following table provides information related to these types of bonds as at december  bid and performance related bonds a performance guarantees b a represents available and undrawn commitments as at december  and december  b in cash and cash equivalents was restricted as cash collateral and is excluded from the december  balance historically  we have not had to make material payments and we do not anticipate that we will be required to make material payments under these types of bonds 
the criteria under which customer performance bonds and contracts can be obtained have changed due to declines in the economic and industry environment and our credit condition 
as a result  we have experienced increased cash collateral requirements and or increased fees in connection with obtaining new customer performance bonds and contracts 
however  we do not expect that the requirements and or fees to obtain customer performance bonds and contracts will have a material adverse effect on our ability to win contracts from potential customers 
our support facility with edc provides support for certain of our obligations under bid and performance related bonds and may reduce the requirement for us to provide cash collateral to support these obligations 
although this facility provides for up to in support  only is committed support for these bonds within certain parameters 
in addition  any bid or performance related bonds with terms that extend beyond june   which is the expiry date of this facility  are currently not eligible for the support provided by this facility 
unless edc agrees to an extension of the facility or agrees to provide support in respect of any such bid or performance related bonds on a case by case basis outside the scope of the facility  we may be required to provide cash collateral to support these obligations 
in addition to the support facility with edc  our existing security agreements permit us to secure additional obligations under bid and performance related bonds with the assets pledged under the security agreements and to provide cash collateral as security for these types of bonds 
see available credit and support facilities for additional information on this support facility and the security agreements 
third party debt agreements in the normal course of business  we have guaranteed the debt of certain customers 
these third party debt agreements require us to make debt payments throughout the term of the related debt instrument if the customer fails to make a scheduled payment

see guarantees and commitments in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements for additional information 
supply and network outsourcing contracts we enter into supply contracts with customers for products and services  which in some cases involve new  undeveloped technologies or requirements for us to build and operate networks 
we also enter into network outsourcing contracts with customers to operate their networks 
some of these supply and network outsourcing contracts contain delivery and installation timetables  performance criteria and other contractual obligations 
if we do not meet these requirements  it could result in our having to pay substantial penalties or liquidated damages  the termination of the related supply or network outsourcing contract  and or the reduction of shared revenues  in certain circumstances 
as is common in our industry  our supply and network outsourcing contracts are highly customized to address each customer s particular needs and concerns 
the nature of the triggering events and the amounts and timing of the penalties associated with these contracts can vary significantly due to a variety of complex  interrelated factors 
we have not experienced material penalty payments on our supply and network outsourcing contracts in any recent reporting period 
certain of our key supply arrangements were negotiated prior to the current industry and economic downturn 
as a result of the extent and duration of this downturn  in respect of one of these arrangements  based on our current revenue levels  we will not meet the minimum volume levels contained in the contract 
as a result  we may be obligated to compensate the supplier for certain direct costs 
the amount of such direct costs cannot be reasonably estimated at this time 
the amount of any such compensation would be based on a variety of complex  interrelated factors including applicable factors that could mitigate such direct costs 
an obligation to pay such compensation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and or supply relationships 
customer financing generally  customer financing arrangements may include financing in connection with the sale of our products and services  as well as funding for non product costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services 
we may also provide funding for working capital purposes and equity financing 
the following table provides information related to our customer financing commitments  excluding our discontinued operations as at december  drawn and outstanding gross a related reserves drawn and outstanding net undrawn commitments total customer financing a includes short term and long term amounts we currently have customer financing commitments and or balances outstanding in connection with the construction of new networks  including g wireless networks 
although we may commit to provide customer financing to customers in areas that are strategic to our core businesses  we remain focused on reducing our overall customer financing exposures consistent with our financing agreements 
during  we reduced undrawn commitments by reflecting commitment 
table of contents expiration  cancellations and changing customer business plans 
in addition to being highly selective in providing customer financing  we have programs in place to monitor and mitigate customer credit risk  including performance milestones and other conditions of funding 
management is focused on the strategic use of our customer financing capacity and on reducing the amount of our existing and future customer financing exposure 
we continue to regularly assess the levels of our customer financing provisions based on a loan by loan review to evaluate whether they reflect current market conditions 
we review the ability of our customers to meet their repayment obligations and determine our provisions accordingly 
any misinterpretation or misunderstanding of these factors by us may result in losses in excess of our provisions 
these losses could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition and customer relationships 
in and  our ability to place customer financing with third party lenders was significantly reduced primarily due to reduced demand for telecommunications financings in capital and bank markets as a result of network overcapacity  bankruptcies and financial difficulties in the industry  our current credit condition  adverse changes in the credit quality of our customers  and economic downturns in various countries 
as a result  we are currently directly supporting most commitments and outstanding balances and expect this to continue in the future as well 
while we will continue to seek to arrange for third party lenders to assume our customer financing obligations  we expect to fund most customer financings in the normal course of our business from working capital and conventional sources of external financing 
commitments to extend future financing generally have conditions for funding  fixed expiration or termination dates and specific interest rates and purposes 
based on the terms of the existing agreements  we expect that a substantial amount of these undrawn commitments will not be funded in however  we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which our customers will satisfy the applicable conditions for funding  and subsequently request funding  prior to the termination date of the commitments 
joint ventures minority interests on october   we entered into a number of put option and call option agreements as well as a share exchange agreement with our partner in three european joint ventures 
if the options and share exchange are exercised  we would be required to deliver to our joint venture partner net consideration of approximately  consisting of approximately in cash  and an in kind component of approximately  representing the return of a loan note currently owed to us by an affiliate of our joint venture partner 
the option agreements and the share exchange agreement can be exercised between july  and december  subject to certain terms and conditions

on december   we announced amendments to our security agreements to facilitate our future financial flexibility 
these security agreements pledge substantially all of the assets of nortel networks limited in favor of certain lenders and the holders of our outstanding public debt 
the amendments  among other things  permit us to secure additional obligations with the assets pledged under the security agreements 
these additional obligations include those under the support facility with edc and other indemnity  guarantee and reimbursement obligations with respect to letters of credit  letters of guarantee  performance bonds  surety bonds  indemnification arrangements and other instruments 
as part of the amendments to the security agreements  we terminated the  april day revolving credit facilities that would have expired in april these credit facilities had previously been amended and extended  and reduced in size from  to  on april  also on december   our  december day credit facilities expired and were not extended 
during  we sold certain real estate in the united kingdom  which resulted in reductions in the available commitments under the december day credit facilities from  to  on february   nortel networks limited entered into an agreement with edc regarding arrangements to provide support  on a secured basis  of certain of our contingent obligations arising out of normal course business activities  including letters of credit  letters of guarantee  indemnity arrangements  performance bonds  surety bonds  receivables sales  securitizations  and similar instruments issued or entered into for our benefit 
this facility  which expires on june   provides for up to in performance related support and is comprised of up to of committed support for performance bonds within certain parameters  up to of uncommitted support for receivables sales securitizations  and up to of additional uncommitted support for performance bonds and receivable sales securitizations 
the support facility with edc does not materially restrict our ability to sell any of our assets subject to certain maximum amounts or to purchase or pre pay any of our currently outstanding debt 
edc is not obligated to make any support available unless certain customary conditions are satisfied  including that nortel networks limited s senior long term debt rating by moody s has not been downgraded to less than b and that its debt rating by s p has not been downgraded to 
table of contents less than b 
if we default on our obligations under this facility and edc realizes upon the security provided under the security agreements in an amount exceeding  we would be in default under the april five year credit facilities and our public debt 
any amounts that are drawn under the april five year credit facilities and all of the obligations under the support facility with edc and our current outstanding public debt are secured equally and ratably with each other 
the security provided under the security agreements is comprised of liens on substantially all of the assets of nortel networks limited and those of most of its united states and canadian subsidiaries  share pledges in certain of nortel networks limited s other subsidiaries  and guarantees by certain of nortel networks limited s wholly owned subsidiaries 
the security agreements were entered into in connection with the  december day credit facilities  which have expired 
the security became effective in the second quarter of  following moody s downgrade of nortel networks limited s senior long term debt rating to below investment grade 
at that time  the security became effective in respect of the  december day credit facilities  as well as any other credit facilities and outstanding public debt which  by their terms  required that the security also apply to them 
this included the  april day revolving credit facilities  which we have terminated  the april five year credit facilities and our outstanding public debt 
if nortel networks limited s senior long term debt rating by moody s returns to baa with a stable outlook and its rating by standard poor s returns to bbb with a stable outlook  the security will be released in full 
if both the april five year credit facilities and the support facility with edc are terminated or expire  the security will also be released in full 
we may provide edc with cash collateral or any other alternative collateral acceptable to edc  in an amount equal to the total amount of our outstanding obligations and undrawn commitments and expenses under this facility  in lieu of the security provided under the security agreements

shelf registration statement and base shelf prospectus in the second quarter of  we filed a shelf registration statement with the united states securities and exchange commission and a base shelf prospectus with the applicable securities regulatory authorities in canada  to qualify for the potential sale of up to  of various types of securities in the united states and or canada 
the qualifying securities include common shares  preferred shares  debt securities  warrants to purchase equity or debt securities  share purchase contracts and share purchase or equity units subject to certain approvals 
as of december   we have utilized approximately  of the  available under the shelf registration statement and base shelf prospectus 
approximately remains available for use 
at the same time as the filing of the shelf registration statement and base shelf prospectus  nortel networks limited and its financing subsidiary withdrew a shelf registration statement filed with the united states securities and exchange commission under which they were previously eligible to issue up to  in debt securities and warrants to purchase debt securities

there can be no assurance that our credit ratings will not be lowered further or that such ratings agencies will not issue adverse commentaries  potentially resulting in higher financing costs and further reduced access to capital markets or alternative financing arrangements 
our credit ratings may also affect our ability  and the cost  to securitize receivables  obtain customer performance bonds and contracts  access the support facility with edc and or enter into normal course derivative or hedging transactions 
debt to capitalization ratio the total debt to total capitalization ratio of nortel networks was at december   compared to at december  the ratio reflects the increase in our deficit  partially offset by the equity offerings on june  see our forward looking statements for factors that may impact our liquidity and capital resources 
off balance sheet arrangements  contractual obligations and contingent liabilities and commitments off balance sheet arrangements we currently conduct certain receivable sales and lease financing transactions through special purpose entities and are in the process of assessing the structure of these transactions against the criteria set out in the financial accounting standards board interpretation no 
consolidation of variable interest entities  or fin our receivable sales transactions are generally conducted either directly with financial institutions or with multi seller conduits 
we do not expect that we will be required to consolidate any of these entities or provide any of the additional disclosures set out in fin certain lease financing transactions are structured through single transaction special purpose entities that currently do not have sufficient equity at risk as defined in fin in addition  we retain certain risks associated with guaranteeing recovery of between percent and percent of the unamortized principal balance of debt which is expected to represent the majority of the risks associated with the special purpose entities activities 
this percentage will be adjusted over time as the underlying debt matures 
therefore  we expect that unless the existing arrangements are modified prior to july   we will be required to consolidate the assets  liabilities and any non controlling interests of these special purpose entities effective july  the total assets and total liabilities held by these entities at december  were approximately and respectively 

table of contents contractual obligations the following table summarizes our contractual obligations over the periods noted below payments due total contractual cash obligations a thereafter obligations long term debt   outsourcing contracts operating leases unconditional purchase obligations total contractual obligations  a contractual cash obligations do not include provisioned lease costs as they were included in our special charges contingent liabilities and commitments customer financing commitments in certain instances  we are committed to provide future financing to certain customers in connection with their purchases of our products and services 
the undrawn commitments were at december  and  at december  commitments to extend future financing generally have conditions for funding  fixed expiration or termination dates and specific interest rates and purposes 
based on the terms of the existing agreements  we expect that a substantial amount of these undrawn commitments will not be funded in however  we cannot predict with certainty the extent to which our customers will satisfy the applicable conditions for funding  and subsequently request funding  prior to the termination date of the commitments 
purchase commitments we have entered into purchase commitments with certain suppliers under which we commit to buy a minimum amount or percentage of designated products in exchange for price guarantees or similar concessions 
in certain of these agreements  we may be required to acquire and pay for such products up to the prescribed minimum or forecasted purchases 
in addition to such purchase commitments  we have also agreed with jds uniphase corporation that if we purchase a minimum amount of designated products determined as a percentage of our total purchases for such products during the period from january  to december   we would earn consideration from jds as a reduction in whole or in part  of the deferred consideration otherwise payable in our common shares to jds 
the consideration was valued at as at the of february  agreement date and has been recorded as purchase discounts and reflected as a reduction of cost of revenues in the amount of and in and  respectively 
we believe that our purchases to date are sufficient to meet the required percentage of our total purchases to december  subsequent to the sale of the majority of our optical components business to bookham technology plc on november   we have begun negotiations with jds related to certain aspects of this arrangement and as a result  we have not recognized any additional purchase discounts beyond november  pending the outcome of these negotiations 
we entered into an arrangement with a minimum purchase commitment of with bookham 
the terms of the commitment require us to purchase of product from bookham between november  and march  should there be a shortfall  we would make a cash payment for a portion of the balance 

table of contents joint ventures minority interests on october   we entered into a number of put option and call option agreements as well as a share exchange agreement with our partner in three european joint ventures 
if the options and share exchange are exercised  we would be required to deliver to our joint venture partner net consideration of approximately  consisting of approximately in cash  and an in kind component of approximately  representing the return of a loan note currently owed to us by an affiliate of our joint venture partner 
the option agreements and the share exchange agreement can be exercised between july  and december   subject to certain terms and conditions 
other contingent liabilities and commitments through our normal course of business  we have also entered into other indemnifications or guarantees that arise in various types of arrangements including business sale agreements  intellectual property indemnification obligations  lease agreements  third party debt agreements  indemnification of lenders and agents under credit facilities  and other indemnification agreements 
historically  we have not made any significant payments under any of these indemnifications or guarantees 
in certain cases  due to the nature of the agreement  we have not been able to estimate our maximum potential loss or the maximum potential loss has not been specified 
however  for those agreements where we have been able to make an estimate  the maximum amount that we would be obliged to pay under these indemnifications and guarantees would be for more information on these contingent liabilities and commitments  you should refer to guarantees and commitments in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
market risk market risk represents the risk of loss that may impact our consolidated financial statements through adverse changes in financial market prices and rates 
our market risk exposure results primarily from fluctuations in interest rates and foreign exchange rates 
to manage the risk from these fluctuations  we enter into various derivative hedging transactions that we have authorized under our policies and procedures 
we maintain risk management control systems to monitor market risks and counter party risks 
these systems rely on analytical techniques including both sensitivity analysis and value at risk estimations 
we do not hold or issue financial instruments for trading purposes 
for a discussion of our accounting policies for derivative financial instruments  see significant accounting policies in note s of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
additional disclosure of our financial instruments is included in financial instruments and hedging activities in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
we manage foreign exchange exposures using forward and option contracts to hedge firm sale and purchase commitments 
our most significant foreign exchange exposures are in the canadian dollar  the united kingdom pound and the euro 
we enter into united states to canadian dollar forward and option contracts intended to hedge the united states to canadian dollar exposure on future revenue and expenditure streams 
we recognize the gains and losses on these contracts in income when the hedged transaction occurs 
we expect to continue to expand our business globally and  as such  expect that an increasing proportion of our business will be denominated in currencies other than united states dollars 
as a result  fluctuations in foreign currencies may have a material impact on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we try to minimize the impact of such currency fluctuations through our ongoing commercial practices and by attempting to hedge our exposures to major 
table of contents currencies 
in attempting to manage this foreign exchange risk  we identify operations and transactions that may have exposure based upon the excess or deficiency of foreign currency receipts over foreign currency expenditures 
our significant currency flows for the year ended december  were in united states dollars  canadian dollars  united kingdom pounds and the euro 
the net impact of foreign exchange fluctuations resulted in gains of in  in and in given our exposure to international markets  we regularly monitor all of our foreign currency exposures 
we cannot predict whether we will incur foreign exchange losses in the future  however  if significant foreign exchange losses are experienced  they could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
we manage interest rate exposures using a diversified portfolio of fixed and floating rate instruments denominated in several major currencies 
we manage these exposures using interest rate swaps  which reduce our cost of financing and the fluctuations in the total interest expense 
we record net settlements on these swap instruments as adjustments to interest expense 
we use sensitivity analysis to measure our foreign currency risk by computing the potential decrease in cash flows that may result from adverse changes in foreign exchange rates 
the balances are segregated by source currency  and a hypothetical unfavorable variance in foreign exchange rates of is applied to each net source currency position using year end rates  to determine the potential decrease in cash flows over the next year 
the sensitivity analysis includes all foreign currency denominated cash  short term and long term debt  and derivative instruments that will impact cash flows over the next year that are held at december  and  respectively 
the underlying cash flows that relate to the hedged firm commitments are not included in the analysis 
the analysis is performed at the reporting date and assumes no future changes in the balances or timing of cash flows from the year end position 
further  the model assumes no correlation in the movement of foreign exchange rates 
based on a one year time horizon  a adverse change in the exchange rates would result in a potential decrease in after tax cash flows of as of december  and as of december  this potential decrease would result primarily from our exposure to the canadian dollar  the united kingdom pound and the euro 
we also use sensitivity analysis to measure our interest rate risk 
as of december   a basis point adverse change in interest rates would not have a material effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
legal proceedings nortel networks and or certain of our directors and officers have been named as defendants in various class action lawsuits 
we are unable to determine the ultimate aggregate amount of monetary liability or financial impact in these legal matters  which unless otherwise specified  seek damages of material or indeterminate amounts 
we are also a defendant in various other suits  claims  proceedings and investigations which are in the normal course of business 
we cannot determine whether these matters will  individually or collectively  have a material adverse effect on our business  results or operations and financial condition 
we  and any of our named directors or officers  intend to vigorously defend these actions suits  claims  proceedings and investigations 
for additional information related our legal proceedings  see contingencies in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 
environmental matters we are subject to numerous environmental protection laws and regulations in various jurisdictions around the world  primarily due to our manufacturing operations 
as a result  we are exposed to liabilities and compliance costs arising from our past and current generation  management and disposition of hazardous substances and wastes 
we have remedial activities under way at twelve of our facilities which are either currently occupied or were previously owned or occupied 
we have also been listed as a potentially responsible party at five superfund sites in the united states 
an estimate of our anticipated remediation costs associated with all such facilities and sites  to the extent probable and reasonably estimable  is included in our environmental accruals in an approximate amount of for a discussion of environmental matters  see contingencies in note of the accompanying consolidated financial statements 

table of contents forward looking statements certain statements in this annual report on form k  contain words such as could  expects  may  anticipates  believes  intends  estimates  plans  envisions  and other similar language and are considered forward looking statements 
these statements are based on our expectations  estimates  forecasts and projections about the operating environment  economies and markets in which we operate 
in addition  other written or oral statements which are considered forward looking may be made by us or others on our behalf 
these statements are subject to important risks  uncertainties and assumptions  which are difficult to predict and the actual outcome may be materially different 
some of the factors which could cause results or events to differ from current expectations include  but are not limited to  the factors described below 
unless required by applicable securities laws  we do not have any intention or obligation to publicly update or revise any forward looking statements  whether as a result of new information  future events or otherwise 
we have restructured our business to respond to industry and market conditions 
the assumptions underlying our restructuring efforts may prove to be inaccurate and we may have to restructure our business again in the future 
we continue to restructure our business to realign resources and achieve desired cost savings 
we have based our restructuring efforts on certain assumptions regarding the cost structure of our business and the nature  severity and duration of the industry downturn which may or may not be correct 
our restructuring efforts may not be sufficient for us to achieve profitability and meet the changes in industry and market conditions 
we must be able to successfully implement our work plan and refine  expand or extend it if necessary  if we are to reduce our cost structure appropriately to respond to changing market conditions 
we must also manage the potentially higher growth areas of our business  as well as the non core areas  in order for us to achieve a return to profitability 
while restructuring  we have made  and will continue to make  judgments as to whether we should further reduce our workforce or exit  or dispose of  certain businesses 
these workforce reductions may impair our ability to achieve our current or future business objectives 
costs incurred in connection with restructuring efforts may be higher than estimated 
any decision by management to further limit investment or exit  or dispose of  businesses may result in the recording of additional charges 
as a result  the costs actually incurred in connection with the restructuring efforts may be higher than originally planned and may not lead to the anticipated cost savings and a return to profitability 
as part of our review of restructured businesses  we also look at the recoverability of their tangible and intangible assets 
future market conditions may trigger further write downs of these assets due to uncertainties in the estimates and assumptions used in asset valuations  which are based on our forecasts of future business performance  and accounting estimates relating to the useful life and recoverability of the net book value of these assets  including goodwill  net deferred taxes  pension assets and other intangible assets 
we have stated that we will continue to review our work plan based on an ongoing assessment of the industry adjustment 
we may be materially and adversely affected by continued reductions in spending by our customers 
a continued slowdown in capital spending by service providers and other customers may affect our revenues more than we currently expect 
moreover  the significant slowdown in capital spending by our customers  coupled with existing economic and geopolitical uncertainties and the potential impact on customer demand  has created uncertainty as to market demand 
as a result  revenues and operating results for a particular period can be difficult to predict 
in addition  there can be no certainty as to the severity or duration of the current industry adjustment 
many of our traditional customers have already begun to invest in data networking and or are in the process of transitioning from voice only networks to networks which include data traffic 
however  as a result of changes in industry and market conditions  many of our customers have significantly reduced their capital spending 
our revenues and operating results have been and may continue to be materially and adversely affected by the continued reductions in capital spending by our customers 
if the reduction of capital spending continues longer than we expect and we continue to incur net losses as a result or if we are required to record additional charges relating to our restructuring work plan  the valuation of deferred income tax assets or for other events  we may be 
table of contents unable to comply with the financial covenant under our current credit facilities 
as well  we have focused on the larger customers in certain markets  which provide a substantial portion of our revenues 
a reduction or delay in business from one or more of these customers  or a failure to achieve a significant market share with these customers  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our operating results have historically been subject to yearly and quarterly fluctuations and are expected to continue to fluctuate 
our operating results have historically been and are expected to continue to be subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations as a result of a number of factors 
these factors include our ability to successfully implement programs to stimulate customer spending by anticipating and offering the kinds of products and services customers will require in the future to increase the efficiency and profitability of their networks  our ability to successfully complete programs on a timely basis to reduce our cost structure  including fixed costs  to streamline our operations and to reduce product costs  our ability to focus our business on what we believe to be potentially higher growth  higher margin businesses and to dispose of or exit non core businesses  increased price and product competition in the networking industry  the inherent uncertainties of using forecasts  estimates and assumptions for asset valuations and in determining the amounts of accrued liabilities and other items in our consolidated financial statements  the impact of changes in global capital markets and interest rates on our pension plan assets and obligations  our ability to implement our work plan without negatively impacting our relationships with our customers  the delivery of products based on new and developing technologies  the delivery of high quality robust products at competitive prices  the maintenance of technological leadership  the effectiveness of our internal processes and organizations and the retention of qualified personnel  fluctuations in our gross margins  the development  introduction and market acceptance of new technologies  and integrated networking solutions  as well as the adoption of new networking standards  variations in sales channels  product costs and the mix of products sold  the size and timing of customer orders and shipments  our ability to continue to obtain customer performance bonds and contracts  our ability to maintain appropriate inventory levels  the impact of acquired businesses and technologies  the impact of our product development schedules  product quality variances  manufacturing capacity and lead times required to produce our products  changes in legislation  regulation and or accounting rules  the impact of higher insurance premiums and deductibles and greater limitations on insurance coverage  and acts of terrorism or the outbreak of hostilities or armed conflict between countries 
our decision to adopt fair value accounting for employee stock options on a prospective basis commencing january  will cause us to record an expense over the stock option vesting period  based on the fair value at the date the options are granted  and could have a significant negative effect on our reported results 

table of contents additionally  we are required to perform goodwill impairment tests on an annual basis and between annual tests in certain circumstances  to value our deferred tax assets and to accrue unfunded pension liabilities  each of which may have a negative effect on our reported results 
we enter into agreements that may require us to make certain indemnification payments to third parties in the event of certain changes in an underlying economic characteristic related to assets  liabilities or equity securities of such third parties 
we have historically not made any significant indemnification payments under such agreements 
the occurrence of events that may cause us to become liable to make an indemnification payment is not within our control and an obligation to make a significant indemnification payment under such agreements could have a significant negative effect on our reported results 
significant fluctuations in our operating results could contribute to volatility in the market price of nortel networks common shares 
economic conditions in the united states  europe  canada and globally affecting the industry  as well other trends and factors affecting the industry  are beyond our control and may result in reduced demand and pricing pressure on our products 
there are trends and factors affecting the industry that are beyond our control and may affect our operations 
such trends and factors include adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt markets and our ability  as well as the ability of our customers and suppliers  to obtain financing or to fund working capital and capital expenditures  adverse changes in our current credit condition or the credit quality of our customers and suppliers  adverse changes in the market conditions in our industry and the specific markets for our products  the trend towards the sale of integrated networking solutions  visibility to  and the actual size and timing of  capital expenditures by our customers  inventory practices  including the timing of product and service deployment  of our customers  the amount of network capacity and the network capacity utilization rates of our customers  and the amount of sharing and or acquisition of new and or existing network capacity by our customers  policies of our customers regarding utilization of single or multiple vendors for the products they purchase  the overall trend toward industry consolidation and rationalization among our customers  competitors and suppliers  conditions in the broader market for communications products  including data networking products and computerized information access equipment and services  governmental regulation or intervention affecting communications or data networking  and the effects of war and acts of terrorism  such as disruptions in general global economic activity  changes in logistics and security arrangements and reduced customer demand for our products and services 
economic conditions affecting the industry  which affect market conditions in the telecommunications and networking industry  in the united states  europe  canada and globally  affect our business 
reduced capital spending and or negative economic conditions in these and or other areas of the world have resulted in  and could continue to result in  reduced demand for or increased pricing pressures on our products 
our gross margins may be negatively affected  which in turn would negatively affect our operating results and could contribute to volatility in the market price of nortel networks common shares 
our gross margins may be negatively affected as a result of a number of factors  including increased price competition  
table of contents excess capacity or excess fixed assets  customer and contract settlements  higher product  material or labour costs  increased inventory provisions or contract and customer settlement costs  warranty costs  obsolescence charges  loss of cost savings on future inventory purchases as a result of high inventory levels  introductions of new products and costs of entering new markets  increased levels of customer services  changes in distribution channels  and changes in product and geographic mix 
lower than expected gross margins would negatively affect our operating results and could contribute to volatility in the market price of nortel networks common shares 
we may not be able to attract or retain the specialized technical and managerial personnel necessary to achieve our business objectives 
competition for certain key positions and specialized technical personnel in the high technology industry remains strong  despite current economic conditions 
we believe that our future success depends in part on our continued ability to hire  assimilate  and retain qualified personnel in a timely manner  particularly in key senior management positions and in our key areas of potential growth 
an important factor in attracting and retaining qualified employees is our ability to provide employees with the opportunity to participate in the potential growth of our business through programs such as stock option plans and employee investment plans 
the scope of these programs for employees and the value of these opportunities have been adversely affected by the volatility or negative performance of the market price for nortel networks common shares including the proposed consolidation of nortel networks common shares 
we may also find it more difficult to attract or retain qualified employees because of our recent significant workforce reductions and business performance which has negatively impacted our level of incentive programs and incentive compensation plans 
in addition  if we have not properly sized our workforce and retained those employees with the appropriate skills  our ability to compete effectively may be adversely affected 
we are also more dependent on those employees we have retained  as many have taken on increased responsibilities due to the workforce reductions 
if we are not successful in attracting  retaining or recruiting qualified employees  including members of senior management  in the future  we may not have the necessary personnel to effectively compete in the highly dynamic  specialized and volatile industry in which we operate or to achieve our business objectives 
future cash flow fluctuations may affect our ability to fund our working capital requirements or achieve our business objectives in a timely manner 
our working capital requirements and cash flows historically have been  and are expected to continue to be  subject to quarterly and yearly fluctuations  depending on such factors as timing and size of capital expenditures  levels of sales  timing of deliveries and collection of receivables  inventory levels  customer payment terms  customer financing obligations and supplier terms and conditions 
in addition  due to the current general economic and industry environment  and our current credit condition  an increased portion of our cash and cash equivalents may be restricted as cash collateral for customer performance bonds and contracts  notwithstanding our support facility with edc 
also  except for the april five year credit facilities  all of the credit facilities previously available to us until december  have either expired or been terminated 
we continue to have ongoing discussions with our banks and other financial institutions to explore additional financing opportunities and credit and support arrangements 
as we continue to assess our overall liquidity and business needs as well as our expected financial performance  we may elect or it may be necessary to reduce or terminate our april five year credit facilities prior to their expiries 
we believe our cash on hand will be sufficient to fund our current business model  manage our investments and meet our customer commitments for at least the next months 
however  a greater than expected slow down in capital spending by service providers and other customers may require us to adjust our current business model 
as a result  our revenues and cash flows may be materially lower than we expect and we 
table of contents may be required to further reduce our capital expenditures and investments or take other measures in order to meet our cash requirements 
we may seek additional funds from liquidity generating transactions and other conventional sources of external financing which may include a variety of debt  convertible debt and or equity financings 
we cannot provide any assurance that our net cash requirements will be as we currently expect  that we will continue to have access to the april five year credit facilities or the support facility with edc when and as needed  or that liquidity generating transactions or financings will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
our inability to manage cash flow fluctuations resulting from the above factors and the potential reduction or termination of our april five year credit facilities or the support facility with edc could have a material adverse effect on our ability to fund our working capital requirements from operating cash flows and other sources of liquidity or to achieve our business objectives in a timely manner 
our business may be materially and adversely affected by our increased levels of debt 
in order to finance our business we have incurred  and have credit facilities allowing for drawdowns of  and have a shelf registration statement and a base shelf prospectus for potential offerings of  significant levels of debt compared to historical levels  and we may need to secure additional sources of funding  which may include debt or convertible debt financing  in the future 
a high level of debt  arduous or restrictive terms and conditions relating to accessing certain sources of funding  failure to meet the financial and or other covenants in our credit and or support facilities and any significant reduction in  or access to  such facilities  poor business performance or lower than expected cash inflows could have adverse consequences on our ability to fund our business and the operation of our business 
other effects of a high level of debt include the following we may have difficulty borrowing money in the future or accessing sources of funding  we may need to use a large portion of our cash flow from operations to pay principal and interest on our indebtedness  which would reduce the amount of cash available to finance our operations and other business activities  a high debt level  arduous or restrictive terms and conditions  or lower than expected cash flows would make us more vulnerable to economic downturns and adverse developments in our business  and if operating cash flows are not sufficient to meet our operating expenses  capital expenditures and debt service requirements as they become due  we may be required  in order to meet our debt service obligations  to delay or reduce capital expenditures or the introduction of new products  sell assets and or forego business opportunities including acquisitions  research and development projects or product design enhancements 
our april five year credit facilities contain a financial covenant 
if we are unable to comply with this covenant  it will adversely affect our ability to access these credit facilities 
our april five year credit facilities include a financial covenant  which requires that nortel networks limited s consolidated tangible net worth at any time be not less than  we continue to monitor the financial position of nortel networks limited in light of this covenant and we expect that if we continue to incur net losses or record additional charges relating to our restructuring work plan  the accounting of our registered pension plans  the valuation of deferred income tax assets or for other events  nortel networks limited s consolidated tangible net worth may be reduced below the  threshold 
if nortel networks limited is unable to comply with this covenant  we will be unable to access these credit facilities 
an increased portion of our cash and cash equivalents may be restricted as cash collateral if we are unable to conclude satisfactory arrangements for alternative support for certain obligations arising out of our normal course business activities 
our support facility with edc may not provide all the support we require in respect of certain of our obligations arising out of our normal course of business activities 
in particular  although this facility provides for up to in support  only is committed support for performance bonds within certain parameters 
in addition  bid and performance related bonds with terms that extend beyond june   which is the expiry date of this facility  are currently not eligible for the support provided by this facility 
unless edc agrees to an extension of the facility or agrees to provide support outside the 
table of contents scope of the facility  we may be required to provide cash collateral to support these obligations 
we cannot provide any assurance that we will reach an agreement with edc on these matters 
we are also in discussions with banks and financial institutions regarding arrangements  in addition to the support facility with edc  that would provide for additional support  possibly on a secured basis  of these obligations  which include letters of credit  letters of guarantee  indemnity arrangements  performance bonds  surety bonds  receivables purchases  securitizations and similar instruments and arrangements 
we cannot provide any assurance that such discussions will result in satisfactory arrangements 
if we are unable to successfully conclude these arrangements and do not have access to sufficient support for such obligations under the support facility with edc  an increased portion of our cash and cash equivalents may be restricted as cash collateral provided as security for these obligations  which could adversely affect our ability to support some of our normal course business activities and our ability to borrow in the future 
changes in respect of our public debt ratings or current credit condition may materially and adversely affect the availability  the cost and the terms and conditions of our debt and alternative financing arrangements 
certain of our outstanding debt instruments are publicly rated by independent rating agencies  which ratings are below investment grade 
these public debt ratings and our current credit condition affect our ability to raise debt  our access to the commercial paper market which is currently closed to us  our ability to engage in alternative financing arrangements  our ability to engage in normal course derivative or hedging transactions and our ability to obtain customer performance bonds and contracts 
these public debt ratings have also caused the security that we granted to certain lenders and holders of our outstanding public debt under our existing security agreements to become effective 
this security  which consists of pledges of substantially all of the assets of nortel networks limited  will continue to apply to our obligations under the april five year credit facilities  the support facility with edc and our outstanding public debt  unless such credit facilities are terminated or expire  such support facility expires or alternative collateral is provided  or such public debt ratings return to investment grade or higher 
the continued existence of such security arrangements may adversely affect our ability to incur additional debt or secure alternative financing arrangements 
in addition  edc is not obligated to make any support available unless certain customary conditions are satisfied  including that nortel networks limited s senior long term debt rating by moody s has not been downgraded to less than b and that its debt rating by s p has not been downgraded to less than b 
our current credit condition requires us to pay increased fees and or post cash collateral to secure certain customer performance bonds and contracts and may also negatively affect the cost to us and terms and conditions of debt and alternative financing arrangements 
additionally  any negative developments regarding our cash flow  public debt ratings  current credit condition and or our incurring significant levels of debt  or our failure to meet certain covenants under our credit and or support facilities  could cause us to lose access to and or cause a default under such facilities and or adversely affect further the cost and terms and conditions of our debt and alternative financing arrangements 
an inability of our subsidiaries to provide us with funding in sufficient amounts could adversely effect our ability to meet our obligations 
nortel networks corporation may at times depend primarily on loans  dividends  or other forms of financing from our subsidiaries to meet our obligations for payment of interest and principal on outstanding public debt and corporate expenses 
an inability of our subsidiaries to pay dividends or provide loans or other forms of financing in sufficient amounts could adversely effect our ability to meet these obligations 
we have risks related to our defined benefit plans 
we currently maintain various defined benefit plans in north america and the united kingdom which cover various categories of employees and retirees 
our obligations to make contributions to fund benefit obligations under these plans are based on actuarial valuations  which themselves are based on certain assumptions about the long term operation of the plans  including employee turnover and retirement rates  the performance of the financial markets and interest rates 
if the actual operation of the plans differs from the assumptions  additional contributions by us may be required 
the equity markets can be  and recently have been  very volatile  and therefore our estimate of future contribution requirements can change significantly in a short period of time 
similarly  changes in interest rates can impact our contribution requirements 
in a low interest rate environment  the likelihood of required contributions in the future increases 
if we are required to make 
table of contents significant contributions to fund the defined benefit plans  our reported results could be materially and adversely affected and our cash flow available for other uses may be significantly reduced 
if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected  additional valuation allowances may be required for all or a portion of our deferred tax assets 
we currently have deferred tax assets  which may be used to reduce taxable income in the future 
we assess the realization of these deferred tax assets quarterly  and if we determine that it is more likely than not that some portion of these assets will not be realized  an income tax valuation allowance is recorded 
if market conditions deteriorate further or future results of operations are less than expected  future assessments may result in a determination that it is more likely than not that some or all of the net deferred tax assets are not realizable 
as a result  we may need to establish additional tax valuation allowances for all or a portion of the net deferred tax assets  which may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our performance may be materially and adversely affected if our expectations regarding market demand for particular products prove to be wrong 
we expect that data communications traffic will grow at a faster rate than the growth expected for voice traffic and that the use of the internet will continue to increase 
we expect the growth of data traffic and the use of the internet will significantly impact traditional voice networks  both wireline and wireless 
we believe that this will create market discontinuities 
by market discontinuities  we mean opportunities for new technologies  applications  products and services that enable the secure  rapid and efficient transport of large volumes of data traffic over networks and allow service providers and carriers to increase revenues and improve operating results 
market discontinuities will also make traditional voice network products and services less effective as they were not designed for data traffic 
we believe that these market discontinuities in turn will lead to the convergence of data and voice through upgrades of traditional voice networks to transport large volumes of data traffic or through the construction of new networks designed to transport both voice and data traffic 
either approach would require significant capital expenditures by service providers 
we also believe that such developments will give rise to the demand for internet protocol  or ip  optimized networking solutions  and third generation  or g  wireless networks 
internet protocol is the predominant method by which data is sent from one computer to another on the internet a data message is divided into smaller packets which contain both the sender s unique ip address and the receiver s unique ip address  and each packet is sent  potentially by different routes and as independent units  across the internet 
there is no continuing connection between the end points which are communicating versus traditional telephone communications which involve establishing a fixed circuit that is maintained for the duration of the voice or data communications call 
g wireless networks are an evolution of communications networks from second generation wireless networks for voice and low speed data communications that are based on circuit switching when a call is dialed  a circuit is established between the mobile handset and the third party  and the connection lasts for the duration of the call 
by comparison  g networks allow devices to be always on because the networks are packet based 
we expect g wireless networks to include such features as voice  high speed data communications and high bandwidth multimedia capabilities  and usability on a variety of different communications devices  such as cellular telephones and pagers  with the user having accessibility anywhere and at any time to these features 
we cannot be sure what the rate of such convergence of voice and data networks will be  due to the dynamic and rapidly evolving nature of the communications business  the technology involved and the availability of capital 
consequently  market discontinuities and the resulting demand for ip optimized networking solutions or g wireless networks may not materialize 
alternatively  the pace of that development may be slower than currently anticipated 
it may also be the case that the market may develop in an unforeseen direction 
certain events  including the commercial availability and actual implementation of new technologies  including g networks  or the evolution of other technologies  may occur which would affect the extent or timing of anticipated market demand  or increase demand for products based on other technologies  or reduce the demand for ip optimized networking solutions or g wireless networks  which in turn may reduce purchases of our networking solutions by our customers  require increased expenditures to develop and market different technologies  or provide market opportunities for our competitors 
our performance may also be materially and adversely affected by a lack of growth in the rate of data traffic  a reduction in the use of the internet or a reduction in the demand for ip optimized networking solutions or g wireless networks in the future 

table of contents we have made  and may continue to make  strategic acquisitions in order to enhance our business 
if we are not successful in operating or integrating these acquisitions  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be materially and adversely affected 
in the past  we acquired companies to enhance the expansion of our business and products 
we may consider selective opportunistic acquisitions of companies or businesses with resources and product or service offerings capable of providing us with additional strengths to help fulfill our vision of building the new  high performance internet 
acquisitions involve significant risks and uncertainties 
these risks and uncertainties include the risk that the industry may develop in a different direction than anticipated and that the technologies we acquire do not prove to be those we need to be successful in the industry  the risk that future valuations of acquired businesses may decrease from the market price we paid for these acquisitions  the generation of insufficient revenues by acquired businesses to offset increased operating expenses associated with these acquisitions  the potential difficulties in completing in process research and development projects and delivering high quality products to our customers  the potential difficulties in integrating new products  businesses and operations in an efficient and effective manner  the risk that our customers or customers of the acquired businesses may defer purchase decisions as they evaluate the impact of the acquisitions on our future product strategy  the potential loss of key employees of the acquired businesses  the risk that acquired businesses will divert the attention of our senior management from the operation of our business  and the risks of entering new markets in which we have limited experience and where competitors may have a stronger market presence 
our inability to successfully operate and integrate newly acquired businesses appropriately  effectively and in a timely manner could have a material adverse effect on our ability to take advantage of further growth in demand for ip optimized network solutions and other advances in technology  as well as on our revenues  gross margins and expenses 
we operate in highly dynamic and volatile industries characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
the markets for our products are characterized by rapidly changing technologies  evolving industry standards  frequent new product introductions and short product life cycles 
we expect our success to depend  in substantial part  on the timely and successful introduction of high quality  new products and upgrades  as well as cost reductions on current products to address the operational speed  bandwidth  efficiency and cost requirements of our customers 
our success will also depend on our ability to comply with emerging industry standards  to operate with products of other suppliers  to address emerging market trends  to provide our customers with new revenue generating opportunities and to compete with technological and product developments carried out by others 
the development of new  technologically advanced products  including ip optimized networking solutions and g wireless networks  is a complex and uncertain process requiring high levels of innovation  as well as the accurate anticipation of technological and market trends 
investments in such development may result in expenses growing at a faster rate than revenues  particularly since the initial investment to bring a product to market may be high 
we may not be successful in targeting new market opportunities  in developing and commercializing new products in a timely manner or in achieving market acceptance for our new products 
the success of new or enhanced products  including ip optimized networking solutions and g wireless networks  depends on a number of other factors  including the timely introduction of such products  market acceptance of new technologies and industry standards  the quality and robustness of new or enhanced products  competing product offerings  the pricing and marketing of such products and the availability of funding for such networks 
products and technologies developed by our competitors may render our products obsolete 
hackers may attempt to disrupt or exploit our customers use of our technologies 
if we fail to respond in a timely and effective manner to unanticipated changes in one or more of the 
table of contents technologies affecting telecommunications and data networking or our new products or product enhancements fail to achieve market acceptance  our ability to compete effectively in our industry  and our sales  market share and customer relationships could be materially and adversely affected 
in addition  unanticipated changes in market demand for products based on a specific technology  particularly lower than anticipated  or delays in  demand for ip optimized networking solutions  particularly long haul and metro optical networking solutions  or g wireless networks  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition if we fail to respond to such changes in a timely and effective manner 
we face significant competition and may not be able to maintain our market share and may suffer from competitive pricing practices 
we operate in a highly volatile industry that is characterized by industry rationalization and consolidation  vigorous competition for market share and rapid technological development 
competition is heightened in periods of slow overall market growth 
these factors could result in aggressive pricing practices and growing competition from smaller niche companies  established competitors  as well as well capitalized computer systems and communications companies  which  in turn  could have a material adverse effect on our gross margins 
our major competitors in wireless networks have traditionally included telefonaktiebolagat lm ericsson  lucent technologies inc  motorola  inc  siemens aktiengesellschaft and nokia corporation 
more recently  samsung electronics co  ltd 
and huawei technologies co  ltd 
have emerged as competitors 
our principal competitors in the sale of our enterprise networks solutions to enterprises are cisco systems  inc  avaya inc  alcatel sa  and siemens 
we also compete with smaller companies that address specific niches  such as foundry networks  inc  extreme networks  inc  enterasys networks  inc  com corporation and genesys telecommunications laboratories  inc our principal competitors in the sale of our wireline networks products to service providers are large communications companies such as cisco  lucent  alcatel and siemens 
in addition  we compete with smaller companies that address specific niches within this market  such as sonus systems limited  broadsoft  inc  taqua inc  redback networks inc  equipe communications corporation  laurel networks  inc and wavesmith networks  inc 
certain competitors are also strong on a regional basis  such as zte corporation and huawei 
our major competitors in optical networks include alcatel  lucent  siemens  fujitsu limited  marconi plc  cisco  huawei  nec corporation  ciena corporation and adva international inc since some of the markets in which we compete are characterized by the potential for rapid growth and  in certain cases  low barriers to entry and rapid technological changes  smaller  specialized companies and start up ventures are now or may become principal competitors in the future 
we may also face competition from the resale of used telecommunications equipment  including our own on occasion  by failed  downsized or consolidated high technology enterprises and telecommunications service providers 
in addition  one way to maximize market growth  enhance existing products and introduce new products is through acquisitions of companies  where advisable 
certain of our competitors may enter into additional business combinations  to accelerate product development  or to engage in aggressive price reductions or other competitive practices  creating even more powerful or aggressive competitors 
we expect that we will face additional competition from existing competitors and from a number of companies that have entered or may enter our existing and future markets 
some of our current and potential competitors have greater marketing  technical and financial resources  including access to capital markets and or the ability to provide customer financing in connection with the sale of products 
many of our current and potential competitors have also established  or may in the future establish  relationships with our current and potential customers 
other competitive factors include the ability to provide new technologies and products  end to end networking solutions  and new product features  as well as conformance to industry standards 
increased competition could result in price reductions  negatively affecting our operating results  reducing profit margins and potentially leading to a loss of market share 
we face certain barriers in our efforts to expand internationally 
we intend to continue to pursue international and emerging market growth opportunities 
in many international markets  long standing relationships between potential customers and their local suppliers and protective regulations  including local content requirements and type approvals  create barriers to entry 
in addition  pursuing international opportunities may require significant investments for an extended period before we realize returns on such investments  if 
table of contents any  and such investments may result in expenses growing at a faster rate than revenues 
furthermore  such projects and investments could be adversely affected by reversals or delays in the opening of foreign markets to new competitors  trade protection measures  exchange controls  currency fluctuations  investment policies  restrictions on repatriation of cash  nationalization of local industry  economic  social and political risks  taxation  interest rates  other factors  depending on the country involved  and acts of war or terrorism 
difficulties in foreign financial markets and economies and of foreign financial institutions  particularly in emerging markets  could adversely affect demand from customers in the affected countries 
an inability to maintain or expand our business in international and emerging markets could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
fluctuating foreign currencies may negatively impact our business  results of operations and financial condition 
as an increasing proportion of our business may be denominated in currencies other than united states dollars  fluctuations in foreign currencies may have an impact on our business  results of operations  and financial condition 
our primary currency exposures are to canadian dollars  united kingdom pounds and the euro 
these exposures may change over time as we change the geographic mix of our global business and as our business practices evolve 
for instance  if we increase our presence in emerging markets  we may see an increase in our exposure to such emerging market currencies  such as  for example  the chinese renminbi 
these currencies may be affected by internal factors  and external developments in other countries  all of which can have an adverse impact on a country s currency 
also  availability to enter into normal course derivative or hedging transactions in the future may be impacted by our current credit condition 
we cannot predict whether foreign exchange losses will be incurred in the future  and significant foreign exchange fluctuations may have a material adverse effect on our results of operations 
we may become involved in disputes regarding intellectual property rights that could materially and adversely affect our business if we do not prevail 
our industry is subject to uncertainty over adoption of industry standards and protection of intellectual property rights 
our success is dependent on our proprietary technology  which we rely on patent  copyright  trademark and trade secret laws to protect 
while our business is global in nature  the level of protection of our proprietary technology provided by such laws varies by country 
our issued patents may be challenged  invalidated  or circumvented  and our rights under issued patents may not provide us with competitive advantages 
patents may not be issued from pending applications  and claims in patents issued in the future may not be sufficiently broad to protect our proprietary technology 
in addition  claims of intellectual property infringement or trade secret misappropriation may be asserted against us or our customers in connection with their use of our products and the outcome of any such claims are uncertain 
a failure by us to react to changing industry standards  the lack of broadly accepted industry standards  successful claims of intellectual property infringement or other intellectual property claims against us or our customers  or a failure by us to protect our proprietary technology  could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
in addition  if others infringe on our intellectual property rights  we may not be able to successfully contest such challenges 

table of contents rationalization and consolidation in the industry may cause us to experience a loss of customers and increased competition 
the industry has experienced the consolidation and rationalization of industry participants and this trend may continue 
there have been adverse changes in the public and private equity and debt markets for industry participants which have affected their ability to obtain financing or to fund capital expenditures 
some operators have experienced financial difficulty and have  or may  file for bankruptcy protection or be acquired by other operators 
other operators may merge and we and one or more of our competitors may each supply products to the companies that have merged or will merge 
this rationalization and or consolidation could result in our dependence on a smaller number of customers  purchasing decision delays by the merged companies and or our playing a lesser role  or no longer playing a role  in the supply of communications products to the merged companies 
this rationalization and or consolidation could also cause increased competition among our customers and pressure on the pricing of their products and services  which could cause further financial difficulties for our customers 
a rationalization of industry participants could also increase the supply of used communications products for resale by affected industry participants  resulting in increased competition and pressure on the pricing for our new products 
in addition  telecommunications equipment suppliers may enter into business combinations  or may be acquired by or sell a substantial portion of their assets to other competitors  resulting in accelerated product development  increased financial strength  or a broader base of customers  creating even more powerful or aggressive competitors 
we may also see rationalization among equipment component suppliers 
the business failures of operators  competitors or suppliers may cause uncertainty among investors and in the industry generally 
changes in regulation of the internet and or other aspects of the industry may affect the manner in which we conduct our business and may materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations and financial condition 
there are currently few domestic or international laws or regulations that apply directly to access to or commerce on the internet 
we could be materially and adversely affected by regulation of the internet in any country where we operate in respect of such technologies as voice over the internet  encryption technology and access charges for internet service providers 
we could also be materially and adversely affected by increased competition  or by reduced capital spending by our customers  as a result of the change in the regulation of the industry 
in particular  on february   the united states federal communications commission  or the fcc  announced a decision in its trienniel review proceeding of the rules regarding unbundled network elements  or unes 
the text of the fcc s order and reasons for the decision were not immediately released 
although the decision may impact the business decisions of our united states based service provider customers  the extent of that impact has not been determined 
if a jurisdiction in which we operate adopts measures which affect the regulation of the internet and or other aspects of the industry  we could experience both decreased demand for our products and increased costs of selling such products 
changes in laws or regulations governing the internet  internet commerce and or other aspects of the industry could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 
our stock price has historically been volatile and further declines in the market price of nortel networks common shares or our other securities may negatively impact our ability to make future strategic acquisitions  raise capital  issue debt or retain employees 
nortel networks common shares have experienced  and may continue to experience  substantial price volatility  including considerable decreases  particularly as a result of variations between our actual or anticipated financial results and the published expectations of analysts and as a result of announcements by our competitors and us 
also  nortel networks is no longer listed on the s p or s p indices which may also affect the price volatility of nortel networks common shares 
our credit quality  any equity or equity related offerings  operating results and prospects  among other factors  including any exclusion of nortel networks common shares from any other widely followed stock market indices  will also affect the market price of nortel networks common shares 
the stock markets have experienced extreme price fluctuations that have affected the market price and trading volumes of many technology and telecommunications companies in particular  with potential consequential negative effects on the trading of securities of such companies 
a major decline in the capital markets generally  or an adjustment in the market price or trading volumes of nortel networks common shares or our other securities  may negatively impact our ability to raise capital  issue debt  retain employees or make future strategic acquisitions 
these factors  as well as general economic 
table of contents and political conditions  and continued negative events within the technology sector  may in turn have a material adverse effect on the market price of nortel networks common shares 
our common shares may be delisted from the new york stock exchange if the minimum average share price listing requirement is not satisfied 
on september   the average closing price of nortel networks common shares on the new york stock exchange during the trading day period prior to such date was below and  as a result  the new york stock exchange notified us that we fell below the continued listing requirements of the exchange  which include a minimum share price condition 
on that day  we announced that we planned to present a proposal to our shareholders for a consolidation of nortel networks common shares also known as a reverse stock split at our annual and special shareholders meeting 
on february   we announced that our shareholders would be asked to approve a proposal to authorize the board of directors of nortel networks to determine whether to implement a share consolidation and  if so  to set the consolidation ratio  in a range of one post consolidation common share for every five pre consolidation common shares to one post consolidation common share for every ten pre consolidation common shares  if at all  at any time prior to april  there can be no assurance that our shareholders will approve the proposal 
rejection of the proposal by our shareholders may result in the delisting of nortel networks common shares from the new york stock exchange if the minimum share price listing condition is not otherwise satisfied 
in addition  in the event that the trading price or trading volume of nortel networks common shares on the new york stock exchange were to fall to an abnormally low level  the new york stock exchange would have discretionary authority to begin delisting proceedings prior to any vote by our common shareholders on the proposal 
the delisting of nortel networks common shares from the new york stock exchange could have a material adverse effect on the market price and liquidity of the common shares 
there are risks associated with a share consolidation 
there can be no assurance that any increase in the market price per nortel networks common share resulting from the proposed share consolidation will be sustainable or that it will equal or exceed the direct arithmetical result of the consolidation that is  from five to ten times the pre consolidation price  depending on the ratio selected by the board of directors of nortel networks since there are numerous factors and contingencies that would effect such price  including the status of the market for the common shares at the time  our reported results of operations in future periods and general economic  geopolitical  stock market and industry conditions 
accordingly  the total market capitalization of nortel networks common shares after the proposed consolidation may be lower than the total market capitalization before the proposed consolidation and  in the future  the market price of the common shares may not exceed or remain higher than the market price prior to the proposed consolidation 
while a higher share price may help generate investor interest in nortel networks common shares  there can be no assurance that a consolidation will result in a per share market price that will attract institutional investors or investment funds or that such price will satisfy the investing guidelines of institutional investors or investment funds 
as a result  the trading liquidity of the common shares may not necessarily improve as a result of a share consolidation 
if the consolidation is implemented and the market price of nortel networks common shares declines  the percentage decline may be greater than would occur in the absence of the consolidation 
the market price of the common shares will  however  also be based on the company s performance and other factors  which are unrelated to the number of common shares outstanding 
furthermore  the liquidity of nortel networks common shares could be adversely affected by the reduced number of common shares that would be outstanding after the consolidation 
acceleration of the settlement date on early settlement of our purchase contracts could contribute to volatility in the market price of nortel networks common shares 
on june   concurrent with the nortel networks common share offering   equity units were offered  each initially evidencing ownership of a prepaid forward purchase contract  or purchase contract  entitling the holder to receive nortel networks common shares  and specified zero coupon us treasury strips 
the aggregate number of nortel networks common shares issuable on the settlement date of the purchase contracts will be between approximately million and million shares  subject to some anti dilution adjustments which include adjustments for the proposed 
table of contents consolidation of nortel networks common shares  depending on the applicable market value of nortel networks corporation common shares 
as at february    purchase contracts were outstanding 
the settlement date for each purchase contract is august   subject to acceleration or early settlement in certain cases 
if nortel networks corporation is involved in a merger  amalgamation  arrangement  consolidation or other reorganization event other than with or into nnl or certain other subsidiaries in which all of its common shares are exchanged for consideration of at least percent of the value of which consists of cash or cash equivalents  then a holder of purchase contracts may elect to accelerate and settle some or all of its purchase contracts  for nortel networks common shares 
the settlement date under each purchase contract will automatically accelerate upon occurrence of specified events of bankruptcy  insolvency or reorganization with respect to nortel networks 
upon acceleration of the settlement date  holders will be entitled to receive  nortel networks common shares per purchase contract regardless of the market price of nortel networks common shares at that time  subject to some anti dilution adjustments 
a holder of purchase contracts may also elect to accelerate the settlement date in respect of some or all of its purchase contracts 
upon an early settlement on or after february   the holder will receive  nortel networks common shares per purchase contract regardless of the market price of nortel networks common shares at that time  subject to some anti dilution adjustments 
an acceleration of the settlement date or early settlement of our purchase contracts could contribute to volatility in the market price of nortel networks common shares 
the current downturn in the economy has increased  and could continue to increase  our exposure to our customers credit risk and the risk that our customers will not be able to fulfill their payment obligations to us under customer financing arrangements 
the competitive environment in which we operate has required us in the past to provide significant amounts of medium term and long term customer financing 
customer financing arrangements may include financing in connection with the sale of our products and services  funding for certain non product and service costs associated with network installation and integration of our products and services  financing for working capital and equity financing 
while we are seeking to reduce our customer financing exposure  we expect we may continue in the future to provide customer financing to customers in areas that are strategic to our core business activity 
if we do  we may be required to directly hold a significantly greater amount of such financings than in the past  when we were able to place a large amount of our customer financing obligations with third party lenders 
we expect to continue to hold certain current and future customer financing obligations for longer periods prior to any possible placement with third party lenders  due to  among other factors  recent economic uncertainty in various countries  adverse capital market conditions  our current credit condition  adverse changes in the credit quality of our customers and reduced demand for telecommunications financing in capital and bank markets 
in addition  risks generally associated with customer financing  including the risks associated with new technologies  new network construction  market demand and competition  customer business plan viability and funding risks  may require us to hold certain customer financing obligations over a longer term 
we may not be able to place any of our current or future customer financing obligations with third party lenders on acceptable terms 
certain customers have been experiencing financial difficulties and have failed to meet their financial obligations 
as a result  we have incurred charges for increased provision related to certain trade and customer financed receivables 
if there are further increases in the failure of our customers to meet their customer financing and receivables obligations to us or if the assumptions underlying the amount of provisions we have taken with respect to customer financing and receivables obligations do not reflect actual future financial conditions and customer payment levels  we could incur losses in excess of our provisions  which could have a material adverse effect on our cash flow and operating results 
negative developments associated with our supply and network outsourcing contracts and contract manufacturing agreements may materially and adversely affect our business  results of operations  financial condition and supply relationships 
we have entered into supply contracts with customers to provide products and services  which in some cases involve new technologies currently being developed  or which we have not yet commercially deployed  or which require us to build and operate networks 
we have also entered into network outsourcing contracts with customers to operate their networks 
some of these supply and network outsourcing contracts contain delivery and installation timetables  performance criteria and other contractual obligations which  if not met  could result in our having to pay substantial penalties or liquidated 
table of contents damages  the termination of the related supply or network outsourcing contract  and or the reduction of shared revenues  in certain circumstances 
unexpected developments in these supply and outsourcing contracts could have a material adverse effect on our revenues  cash flows and relationships with our customers 
our ability to meet customer demand is  in part  dependent on us obtaining timely and adequate component parts and products from suppliers  contract manufacturers  and internal manufacturing capacity 
as part of the transformation of our supply chain from a vertically integrated manufacturing model to a virtually integrated model  we have outsourced a substantial portion of our manufacturing capacity to contract manufacturers 
we work closely with our suppliers and contract manufacturers to address quality issues and to meet increases in customer demand  when needed  and we also manage our internal manufacturing capacity  quality  and inventory levels as required 
however  we may encounter shortages of quality components and or products in the future 
in addition  our component suppliers and contract manufacturers have experienced  and may continue to experience  a consolidation in the industry and financial difficulties  both of which may result in fewer sources of components or products and greater exposure to the financial stability of our suppliers 
a reduction or interruption in component supply or external manufacturing capacity  a significant increase in the price of one or more components  or excessive inventory levels could materially and negatively affect our gross margins and our operating results and could materially damage customer relationships 
further  certain of our key supply arrangements were negotiated prior to the current industry and economic downturn 
as a result of the extent and duration of this downturn  in respect of one of these arrangements based on our current revenue levels  we will not meet the minimum volume level contained in the contract 
as a result  we may be obligated to compensate the supplier for certain direct costs 
the amount of such compensation would be based on a variety of complex  interrelated factors including applicable factors that could mitigate such direct costs 
an obligation to pay such compensation could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations  financial condition  and or supply relationships 
our business may suffer if strategic alliances which we have entered into are not successful 
we have entered into a number of strategic alliances with suppliers  developers and members in our industry to facilitate product compatibility  encourage adoption of industry standards or to offer complementary product or service offerings to meet customer needs 
in some cases  the companies with which we have strategic alliances also compete against us in some of our business areas 
if a member of a strategic alliance fails to perform its obligations  if the relationship fails to develop as expected or if the relationship is terminated  we could experience delays in product availability or impairment of our relationships with our customers 
the adverse resolution of litigation against us could negatively impact our business 
we are currently a defendant in numerous class actions and other lawsuits  including lawsuits initiated on behalf of holders of nortel networks common shares  which seek damages of material and indeterminate amounts  as well as lawsuits in the normal course of business 
we are and may in the future be subject to other litigation arising in the normal course of our business 
litigation may be time consuming  expensive and distracting from the conduct of our business and the outcome of litigation is difficult to predict 
the adverse resolution of any specific lawsuit could have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition
