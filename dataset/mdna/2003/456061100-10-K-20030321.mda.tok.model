item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
we currently are in compliance with these restrictions and covenants and expect that we will continue to comply 
if we were not able to do so  we could be materially and adversely affected  especially if we could not renegotiate with our current lenders or obtain a new credit facility on satisfactory terms 
because arthur andersen llp has ceased operations and has not consented to the inclusion of its report of independent public accountants in this annual report  you may be unable to assert particular claims against it 
after reasonable efforts  we have been unable to obtain the written consent of arthur andersen llp to our inclusion of its report with respect to our consolidated financial statements for the year ended december   and the incorporation thereof into registration statements that we have filed with the securities and exchange commission 
because arthur andersen has not consented to the inclusion of its report in this annual report and its incorporation into previously filed registration statements  you will not be able to sue arthur andersen llp for any untrue statements of a material fact contained in the financial statements audited by arthur andersen or any omissions to state a material fact required to be stated in those financial statements  and therefore your right of recovery under federal securities laws may be limited 

table of contents goodwill impairment affected our financial results in and may unpredictably affect our financial results in the future 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations  and sfas no 
 goodwill and intangible assets  effective for fiscal years beginning after december  under the new rules  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives can no longer be amortized but are subject to annual impairment testing in accordance with the sfas no 
other intangible assets will continue to be amortized over their remaining useful lives 
we adopted sfas no 
on january  and tested goodwill for impairment using the process prescribed in sfas no 
as a result of this analysis  we recorded a non cash charge of million as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the first quarter of associated with the adoption of sfas no 
we remain in full compliance with our bank covenants and nyse continued listing criterion after this non cash change 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that goodwill associated with any businesses we might acquire in the future may be impaired 
any additional resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our results of operations in any future period in which we record a charge for it 
item description of facilities 
currently  we own seven and lease operating properties in cities in the united states for our warehouse  sales  and administrative offices 
we also lease one property in a foreign country 
certain property locations contain multiple operations such as a warehouse and a sales office 
the facilities range in size from less than  square feet to over  square feet 
leases for the facilities expire at various periods between and the aggregate annual lease payments for real properties in was approximately million 
our corporate offices are located in approximately  square feet of office space at east paces ferry road  suite  atlanta  georgia 
this lease commenced in december and expires in february we have subleased approximately  square feet of this office space through the term of our lease 
we believe that our facilities are adequate for our current needs and do not anticipate inordinate difficulty in replacing such facilities or opening additional facilities  if needed

item selected financial data 
the following summary financial data as of and for the years ended december      and have been derived from our audited financial statements 
companies acquired during and and accounted for under the purchase method of accounting are shown only for the period of time from and after our acquisition of them 
that fact accounts for a substantial difference in financial data as of and for the fiscal years and subsequent years as compared to fiscal year and makes comparisons of the data among those periods misleading

item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
in the following discussions  most percentage and dollar amounts have been rounded to aid presentation  as a result  all such figures are approximations 
references to approximations have generally been omitted 
general trends affecting our operations in the last several years  we believe that mrop requirements among large and middle market companies have moved towards a need for services that are customized for each company 
in many cases  our customers needs are centered upon reducing overall mrop costs and increasing operating efficiencies 
as a result  we have targeted sales through our fps program as the principal 
table of contents growth area of our business  and our resulting services for many customers extend well beyond the traditional supplying of mrop products on a timely basis at a favorable price 
in connection with distributing a full line of mrop products to meet the needs of manufacturers and other industrial users  we offer to our customers a wide range of specialized services relating to product selection and application and the customer s production processes that affect the utilization and costs of mrop supplies 
these service offerings include integrated supply arrangements  commodity management  bar code replenishment  vending machines  e business solutions and consulting services  among others 
we were among the first mrop suppliers to offer these types of integrated supply arrangements to customers who desired to outsource all or a substantial portion of their mrop procurement and management functions 
drawing upon our experiences with integrated supply and specialized procurement and fulfillment services and our product knowledge  we have expanded our fps program to meet the growing demand for a wide variety of mrop service offerings 
we believe that demand for fps is increasing  and we have positioned our sales and marketing efforts to focus on fps as a major business strategy 
we believe the success of our fps focused strategy will depend in major part on the successful refocusing and training of our sales and marketing personnel as well as our successful design and implementation of mrop procurement solutions that customers desire 
as discussed elsewhere in this report  fps is both a program comprising services that we offer to our customers as well as our approach to providing those services and mrop products 
in the fps program  we design and implement solutions individually tailored to accommodate each customer s particular mrop needs 
while fps sales and marketing is now our major strategic focus  we will continue to focus substantial attention on traditional sales of mrop products from stock or on a special order basis non stock especially to the mid market customer segment 
traditional sales have historically been our principal source of revenue  and we expect that they will remain a source of substantial revenue  even as we increase our fps sales 
a summary review of our sales results for the past three years reflects the trend we see with respect to the demand for fps services among our mrop customers  which we believe supports our recognition of a trend within the industry in general 
our total sales for   and were million  million  and million  respectively 
of these amounts  fps sales including sales pursuant to integrated supply arrangements have increased steadily  both in dollar value even as total sales have declined and as a percentage of total sales  as reflected in the following table 
we expect the upward trend in fps sales to continue for the foreseeable future 
year ended december  net sales of total net sales of total net sales of total dollars in millions fps sales  including integrated supply traditional sales total net sales certain effects of our increasing fps sales we expect that our fps sales will continue to increase  especially as a percentage of aggregate sales relative to traditional sales 
we expect this will occur in large part from the addition of new fps customers 
we also expect the purchasing patterns of our fps customers to evolve and change as economic conditions change 
as a result of these expected changes in our fps sales  we may experience changes relative to prior years in measures such as our cost of sales as a percentage of net sales and our selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
these measures may change because of differences between fps sales and traditional sales  including cost of sales and selling  general and administrative expenses related to each type of sale 
specifically  in fps arrangements in which we become the exclusive or primary supplier of a large volume of mrop products to a customer as occurs with an integrated supply contract  we typically offer volume discounts on products to the customer as part of the overall arrangement to achieve mutually beneficial results for the customer and us 
these product discounts will yield a slightly lower gross margin from fps sales relative to traditional sales 
in certain circumstances  however  we may earn a higher gross margin as a percentage of net sales if our fps product sales to a customer are lower than anticipated 
this can occur in fps arrangements even though our revenue is derived primarily from product revenues 
in certain circumstances and with increasing frequency  our fps arrangements may include a fixed portion of revenues designed to cover our administrative and overhead costs commonly referred to as management fees 
in fps arrangements where we derive a 
table of contents portion of our revenues from management fees  the mix of product sales versus management fee revenues can cause our gross margin as a percentage of net sales to be higher even if our product sales are lower than expected 
while our fps arrangements typically yield a lower gross margin as a percentage of sales than traditional sales  we believe that these arrangements will likely yield a higher operating margin than traditional sales because our selling  general and administrative expenses are lower and more variable in fps arrangements 
our conclusion is based on our experiences at our integrated supply sites 
at these sites  many of our support functions are performed at the customer s facility 
we therefore incur relatively low fixed costs as a percentage of total costs at integrated supply sites in comparison to our traditional business  which has a higher fixed cost structure and is reliant on the volume of gross profit dollars in order to remain profitable 
because our selling  general and administrative expenses at integrated supply arrangements are variable  we can exert a high degree of control over them 
this control over expenses leads to higher operating margins in integrated supply arrangements 
to a lesser extent than with integrated supply arrangements  we may experience similar effects in connection with other fps services arrangements 
we believe that our overall operating margin achieved on fps sales is and will remain consistent with our objectives for profitability 
during and  we believe that the favorable impact on our aggregate operating margin of increasing fps sales and our cost savings initiatives was partially offset by decreased revenues in our traditional business as a result of economic conditions impacting our customer base 
we believe improvement in the economic conditions in the mrop industry and in our overall volume of business will yield favorable results as to our cost of sales as a percentage of sales and our selling  general  and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales  as well as improve our profitability  as a result of our strategic focus on increasing the level of our fps sales 
results of operations the following table sets forth a summary of our operating data and shows this data as a percentage of net sales for the periods indicated year ended december  dollars in thousands net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general  and administrative expenses impairment and severance expense operating income loss compared to net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in the weak economic conditions that our customers experienced in continued to impact their operations throughout most significantly  our customers in the commercial aerospace and energy industries  and consequently  secondary suppliers to those industries  were adversely affected by the softness in the economy 
our broader customer base experienced declines in production due to employee layoffs and plant closures 
an increase in the number of our fps customers and related revenues mitigated the impact of these economic conditions 
total fps sales increased to million in as compared to million in as a percentage of total sales  fps sales were and in and  respectively 
the increase in fps sales was primarily a result of new fps customers and integrated supply sites implemented as compared to in  we added integrated supply customers that covered new sites 
a significant majority of new fps sales were from customers with whom we did not have a prior relationship 
cost of sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of net sales  however  cost of sales essentially remained stable in as compared to  despite the shift in sales mix towards fps 
during  we were able to increase our gross margins on fps sales due to better pricing on new fps contracts and reduced product requirements at many of our fps customers  which resulted in an increase in management fee revenues as a total percentage of our total fps revenues 
we were also able to improve pricing on our traditional sales during the slight percentage increase from in to in was attributable to increased inventory reserves and freight costs in  as well as lower rebates 
table of contents and purchase discounts as a result of reduced purchase activity 
in  we increased inventory reserves by approximately million  as compared to approximately million in selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in  and as a percentage of sales  this item decreased from in to in the adoption and change in accounting principle associated with sfas no 
eliminated the amortization expense associated with goodwill during  which was approximately million 
excluding the effect of this accounting change  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from to that decrease was primarily the result of lower personnel costs  which decreased million in as compared to the reduction in personnel costs resulted from several programs  such as company wide furloughs  changes in employee benefits  and a modification of a compensation program 
these programs amounted to million in savings in  as compared to million in we have been able to turn these one time reductions into permanent selling  general  and administrative expense savings 
we accomplished this in large part through a reduction in average headcount over the duration of in addition  we realized savings in due to a reduction in occupancy costs associated with our facility rationalization program of million  a reduction in depreciation expense of million  reduced variable selling expenses of approximately million  associated with the decrease in sales volume  and lower levels of operating and administrative costs in conjunction with our company wide initiative to limit discretionary spending 
the reductions noted above were partially offset by an increase in bad debt expense related to trade and other receivables of approximately million 
operating income increased million  or  from income of million in to income of million in this result is primarily attributable to the reduction of selling  general and administrative expenses from to  which was partially offset by the reduction in our sales volume 
compared to net sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in throughout and with increasing severity as the year progressed  our sales were adversely affected by production curtailments  layoffs  and plant closures across our customer base as customers adapted to the softness in the economy 
these developments with our customers reduced their demands for mrop products because the customers reduced their production levels in response to lower demands for their goods 
growth in the fps area of our business partially offset the sales reduction due to economic conditions 
while our existing fps customers were also impacted by capacity reductions in  total fps sales increased compared to  from million to million for due to new customer accounts 
most of the fps sales were to customers with whom we did not have a prior relationship 
cost of sales decreased million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of net sales  however  cost of sales increased slightly from in to in the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of sales is attributable in part to competitive pricing pressures as all mrop suppliers faced a declining demand due to the economic conditions adversely affecting our industry 
also  during  we increased our inventory reserves by approximately million 
however  for the reasons discussed above under certain effects of our increasing fps sales  the substantial increase in our fps sales in with the associated lower gross margin percentages contributed to the relatively higher cost of sales as a percentage of sales 
selling  general  and administrative expenses decreased million  or  from million in to million in as a percentage of sales  however  selling  general  and administrative expenses increased slightly from in to in the decrease in selling  general  and administrative expenses as an absolute amount is due to the impact of our reduction in personnel  cost reduction initiatives  and lower selling costs 
personnel costs decreased million  after severance charges of million  in comparison to a significant portion of this reduction came from our total personnel headcount decreasing over the course of additionally  we implemented a company wide furlough program in september that resulted in a million reduction in personnel costs in our other cost reduction initiatives included concerted efforts to reduce ongoing operating and variable costs 
the savings from these initiatives were partially offset by a million increase in accounts receivable and other reserves over the prior period 
the increase in bad debt expense which is largely attributable to the financial pressures on customers from the general economic conditions prevailing in  along with the decrease in our net sales for  account for the slight increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of net sales 
operating income increased million  or  from a loss of million in to income of million in this result is primarily attributable to the facts that  during  we incurred impairment and severance expenses of million related 
table of contents to the abandonment of our enterprise resource planning erp project and executive separation costs  and we did not incur any impairment and severance expenses in liquidity and capital resources capital availability and requirements at january   we had million of cash and cash equivalents  an additional million of working capital  and an aggregate of million of borrowing capacity under our revolving credit facility for million with a syndicate of commercial banks the credit facility 
based upon our asset base and outstanding borrowings under the credit facility at january   we had borrowing capacity of million 
at december   these amounts were million  million  million  and million  respectively 
our credit facility  which we entered into on december  and amended on august   expires on march  the credit facility may be used for operations and acquisitions  and provides million for swinglines and million for letters of credit 
amounts outstanding under the credit facility bear interest at either the lead bank s corporate rate or libor  plus applicable margins  as we may select from time to time 
we incur a fee between and basis points on the average daily unused capacity during the term 
assets of all our subsidiaries secure the credit facility 
we are also subject to certain financial covenants regarding fixed charges coverage  capital expenditures  and tangible net worth  which could affect our borrowing base under the credit facility 
the principal financial covenants under our credit facility require a fixed charge coverage ratio of and capital expenditures of no more than million in any twelve month period 
our fixed charge coverage ratio was at december  and our capital expenditures were million for the twelve month period ended december  our covenants require a minimum tangible net worth of million  at december   our tangible net worth was million 
we are presently in compliance with all covenants under the credit facility and anticipate that we will remain in compliance with the covenants 
the table below outlines our contractual cash obligations  excluding interest  as they come due 
payments due by period in thousands contractual obligations total thereafter long term debt including capital lease obligations operating leases a obligations under the premium finance arrangement b total contractual cash obligations a included in operating leases is a commitment for the payments due for the remaining term of the leases associated with erp project that was abandoned in the full amount of this commitment is recorded on the balance sheet at december  as a current liability of  and a long term liability of b in  we made a million payment in settlement of the dissenter s rights lawsuit involving a subsidiary that was one of our founding companies 
that payment was financed through a management liability insurance premium financing arrangement with one of our insurance carriers that provided us million of financing that we used to make the million payment and to pay other obligations associated with that settlement 
this premium is being financed through the insurance carrier over a period of thirty six months through march 
table of contents in addition to the contractual cash obligations noted above  we have outstanding standby letters of credit in the amount of approximately million 
these standby letters of credit renew annually 
at each annual renewal  we expect the total amount of the commitment under the existing standby letters of credit to decrease 
the table below outlines commitment expiration per period 
amount of commitment expiration per period in thousands total amount committed thereafter standby letters of credit our principal ongoing capital requirements at the present time are for servicing our outstanding debt as reflected in the above tables  carrying inventory and accounts receivable  and purchasing and upgrading information technology and equipment 
we believe that cash flow from operations and the use of available capacity under our credit facility will be adequate to meet our obligations set forth above and to fund both our current operations and anticipated internal expansion for at least the current year 
we may consider a strategic acquisition opportunity if presented  in such case  cash financing would probably be necessary  and we would need approval from our current lenders or access to other capital sources in order to do so 
the indefinite continuation of the economic conditions that prevailed during could begin to have a material impact on cash flow from operations and our ability to meet covenant requirements  which could restrict our access to funds in the near term 
in addition  a reduction in working capital associated with such an indefinite continuation of these economic conditions could limit our ability to borrow under our credit facility  which could have a material adverse effect on our operations 
we do not believe our business will experience any such results 
we also believe we have streamlined and restructured our operations both to withstand the effects on us from the current economic conditions and to strengthen our liquidity position as well as our overall operating performance when and if the economy begins to improve for our customer base 
analysis of cash flows on an historical basis  net cash provided by used in operating activities for fiscal years   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
in  cash flow from operations was provided primarily from accounts receivable and inventory as a result of better working capital management and a decline in sales volume 
as compared to  the effect of these items was partially offset by a reduction in income tax refunds receivable 
cash flow from operations from to increased primarily because included a million payment made in settlement of the dissenter s rights lawsuit involving a subsidiary that was one of our founding companies 
the change was also due to improved management of accounts receivable and inventory in  in addition to a decline in business activity 
further  during we received million in federal income tax refunds 
net cash used in provided by investing activities for fiscal years  and was million  million  and million  respectively 
during and  cash used in investing activities was primarily for the purchase of property and equipment and for deposits made on equipment purchases 
cash provided by investing activities decreased from to primarily because included our receipt of million of proceeds from the sale of a building in a transaction accounted for as a sale leaseback 
net cash used in provided by financing activities for fiscal years   and was million  million  and million  respectively 
our primary use of cash in financing activities in was for repayment of borrowings under our credit facility and other lines and payments under our management liability insurance 
the decrease in cash used in financing activities from to was a result of lower net repayments of long term debt in as compared to the change from to primarily reflects the net repayment of million under our credit facility in from available cash flow 
additionally  in  we entered into a management liability insurance premium finance arrangement with one of our insurance carriers that provided us million of financing that we used to make the million payment to the dissenting shareholder and pay other obligations associated with that settlement 
this premium is being financed through the insurance carrier over a period of thirty six months that will end in march certain accounting policies and estimates our consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires our management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at 
table of contents the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
our management regularly evaluates its estimates and assumptions 
these estimates and assumptions are based on historical experience and on various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  and form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
while our significant accounting policies are described in note of notes to consolidated financial statements  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates involve a higher degree of complexity and warrant specific description 
evaluation of the recovery of goodwill goodwill  net of accumulated amortization  from prior business combinations amounted to approximately million as of january  we adopted statement of financial accounting standard no 
 goodwill and intangible assets statement on january  statement requires companies to discontinue the amortization of goodwill and to apply an impairment only approach 
this approach requires the use of valuation techniques and methodologies significantly different than the undiscounted cash flow approach that we previously followed 
as a result of the adoption of statement  we recorded a non cash charge of approximately million as a cumulative effect of accounting change in the first quarter of fiscal application of the non amortization provisions of statement resulted in an increase in net income of million per diluted share 
we tested goodwill for impairment using the two step process prescribed in statement in the first quarter of the first step was a screen for potential impairment  while the second step measured the amount of the impairment  if any 
our assessment was based on estimates of the enterprise fair value using a combination of discounted cash flow  market multiple  and comparable transaction approaches which reflect changes in certain assumptions since the date of the acquisitions  and the identification of qualifying intangibles 
a reconciliation of net income loss and earnings loss per common share  adjusted to exclude goodwill amortization expense  net of tax  for the period prior to adoption and the cumulative effect of accounting change recognized in the current period  is as follows in thousands  except share data net income loss amortization of goodwill  net of tax cumulative effect of accounting change adjusted net income loss basic net income loss per common share amortization of goodwill  net of tax  per common share cumulative effect of accounting change  per common share adjusted earnings loss per common share diluted net income loss per common share amortization of goodwill  net of tax  per common share cumulative effect of accounting change  per common share adjusted earnings loss per common share allowance for doubtful accounts methodology we have established an allowance for uncollectible accounts based on our collection experience and an assessment of the collectibility of specific accounts 
we evaluate the collectibility of accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
initially  we estimate an allowance for doubtful accounts as a percentage of accounts receivable based on historical collections experience 
this initial estimate is periodically adjusted when we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations eg  bankruptcy filing or as a result of changes in the overall aging of accounts receivable 
we do not believe our estimate of the allowance for doubtful accounts is likely to be adversely affected by any individual customer  since we have no individually significant customers 
we recorded bad debt expense recoveries of million  million  and million in   and  respectively 
during   and we wrote off million  million  and million against our reserves for 
table of contents accounts receivable 
our reserve for accounts receivable was approximately million and million at december  and  or and of gross receivables  respectively 
inventories slow moving and obsolescence in connection with certain contracts  we maintain certain special inventories for specific customers needs 
in certain contracts  the customers are required to purchase the special inventory at the point in time in which the inventory reaches a certain age 
however  for other customer relationships and inventories  we are not protected by our customer from the risk of inventory loss 
in such cases  we rely on available return privileges with vendors  if any 
therefore  in determining the net realizable value of inventories  we identify slow moving or obsolete inventories that are not protected by our customer agreements from risk of loss  and are not eligible for return under various vendor return programs 
based upon these factors  we estimate the net realizable value of inventories and record any necessary adjustments as a charge to cost of sales 
if our inventory return privileges were discontinued in the future  or if customers were unable to honor the provisions of certain contracts that protect us from inventory losses  our risk of loss associated with obsolete or slowing moving inventories would increase 
during   and we expensed million  million  and million to increase inventory reserves 
we wrote off million  million  and million against our reserves for excess and obsolete inventories during   and  respectively 
our reserve for obsolete and slowing moving inventories was approximately million and million at december  and  or and of gross inventories  respectively 
impairment of long lived assets we periodically evaluate property and equipment for potential impairment indicators 
our judgments regarding the existence of impairment indicators are based on legal factors  market conditions and operational performance 
future events could cause us to conclude that impairment indicators exist and that assets associated with a particular operation are impaired 
evaluating the impairment also requires us to estimate future operating results and cash flows  which also require judgment by management 
any resulting impairment loss could have a material adverse impact on our financial condition and results of operations 
deferred income tax assets we have deferred tax assets  which are subject to periodic recoverability assessments 
the realization of our deferred tax assets is principally dependent upon our being able to generate sufficient future taxable income in certain tax jurisdictions 
the factors used to assess the likelihood of realization are our forecast of future taxable income  which is based upon estimates and assumptions  and available tax planning strategies that could be implemented to realize the net deferred tax assets 
on the basis of the improved operating results and projections for future taxable income  we believe it is more likely than not that our future operations will generate sufficient taxable income to realize the deferred tax assets 
if these estimates and related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record a valuation allowance against our deferred tax assets resulting in additional income tax expense in our consolidated statement of operations 
we evaluate the realizability and appropriateness of our deferred tax assets and liabilities quarterly and assess the need for any valuation allowance against deferred tax assets 
in connection with the adoption of sfas no 
 future tax benefits associated with deductible goodwill amortization for tax purposes were fully reserved with a valuation allowance totaling million 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we believe that our exposures to market risks are immaterial 
we hold no market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
at present  we do not employ any derivative financial instruments  other financial instruments  or derivative commodity instruments to hedge any market risk  and we have no plans to do so in the future 
to the extent we have borrowings outstanding under our credit facility  we are exposed to interest rate risk because of the variable interest rate under the facility
