interstate access rates and resulting earnings are subject to regulation by the federal communications commission fcc 
with respect to interstate services  roseville telephone has filed its own tariff with the fcc for all elements of access services except carrier common line charges  for which roseville telephone concurs with tariffs filed by neca 
the fcc monitors roseville telephone s interstate earnings through the use of annual cost separation studies prepared by roseville telephone  which utilize estimated cost information and projected demand usage 
the fcc establishes rules that carriers must follow in the preparation of the annual studies 
in january  the fcc issued a memorandum opinion and order to another telephone company in which it clarified how internet traffic  which the fcc had prior to that date characterized as largely interstate in nature  should be treated 
additionally  under current fcc rules governing rate making  roseville telephone is required to establish interstate rates based on projected demand usage for its various services and determine the actual earnings from these rates once actual volumes and costs are known 
during and  internet traffic and dsl service grew substantially  far exceeding roseville telephone s estimates  which resulted in actual earnings exceeding the levels allowed by the fcc based on preliminary cost studies  the company recognized liabilities relating to roseville telephone s estimated interstate shareable earnings obligations of thousand and million for the years ended december  and  respectively  through reductions of revenues related to roseville telephone s estimated interstate shareable earnings obligations

subsequent to the court s decision  certain telecommunication companies filed a petition for rehearing 
in august  the petitions for rehearing were denied by the court  and later that month the court s order became effective 
for the monitoring periods through  roseville telephone filed tariffs pursuant to the streamlined procedures and such tariffs were not suspended or investigated 
consequently  during the third quarter of  the company changed its estimate for a portion of roseville telephone s interstate shareable earnings obligations related to those monitoring periods

roseville telephone and sbc agreed to allow the dcp arrangement to expire in december the termination of the dcp did not have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial position as of december  or results of operations for the year then ended 
in  sbc also expressed interest in entering into a new  permanent compensation arrangement for extended area service eas 
at that time  sbc had been paying roseville telephone million per year for eas pursuant to a settlement transition agreement 
in november  the puc authorized sbc to terminate its annual eas payments to roseville telephone effective november  the puc authorized replacement funding to roseville telephone on an interim basis using the current reserve in the chcf 
in addition  the puc opened an order instituting investigation oii for the purpose of determining whether future recovery of all  none  or a portion of the million annual payments previously received from sbc should come from roseville telephone s ratepayers or other regulatory recovery mechanisms 
this proceeding began in  evidentiary hearings were held during  and briefing was completed in february in this proceeding  the office of ratepayer advocates ora recommended that the puc discontinue roseville telephone s present interim eas funding from the chcf without replacement revenues from ratepayers 
the puc s decision in this matter is expected during the puc has made no indication as to what  if any  changes will be forthcoming relating to eas revenues 
the results of these proceedings and their potential effects on roseville telephone cannot yet be determined 
in  the puc issued a decision in connection with roseville telephone s general rate proceeding  which authorized roseville telephone to implement a new regulatory framework nrf for services furnished within roseville telephone s service area in order to accommodate market and regulatory movement toward competition and greater pricing flexibility 
under the nrf  roseville telephone is subject to ongoing monitoring and reporting requirements  including a sharing mechanism whereby roseville telephone is required to share earnings with customers through a reduction of revenues if its earned annual rate of return exceeds that authorized by the puc in accordance with the requirements of its general rate case order  roseville telephone filed an application for review of its nrf in in connection with this proceeding  the puc s ora undertook a verification audit of roseville telephone s non regulated and affiliated transactions pursuant to the general rate case and other puc orders

for the year ended december   million had been returned to consumers 
as of december   the company s consolidated balance sheet reflected aggregate liabilities of million relating to roseville telephone s estimated interstate and intrastate shareable earnings obligations 
the calculations supporting these liabilities are very complex and involve a variety of estimates prior to the ultimate settlement of such obligations 
in addition  roseville telephone s interstate shareable earnings obligations lapse over time if roseville telephone s interexchange carrier and other customers do not claim the amounts ascribed to them 
accordingly  it is reasonably possible that management s estimates of the company s liabilities for interstate and intrastate shareable earnings obligations could change in the near term  and the amounts involved could be material
