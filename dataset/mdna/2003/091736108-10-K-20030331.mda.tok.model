item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the company has identified the policies below as critical to its business operations and the understanding of its results of operations 
the impact and any associated risks related to these policies on our business operations is discussed throughout management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations where such policies affect the company s reported and expected financial results 
note that the company s preparation of this annual report on form k requires it to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of our financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition the company derives revenues from the sale of its software products  professional consulting  and support and maintenance services 
license revenue is recognized when persuasive evidence of an agreement exists  the product has been delivered or services have been provided  the fee is fixed or determinable  and collection of the fee is probable 
from time to time the company will enter into extended payment programs with creditworthy customers 
revenue related to extended payment programs is recognized when payment becomes due to the company 
in making its decision to recognize revenue the company must make a determination of the credit worthiness of its customer 
this determination involves management judgment and while management believes that it can make reliable judgments  there is no guarantee that the revenue recognized will be collected 
the credit worthiness of customers is further analyzed in connection with the company s accounts receivable 
the company recognizes revenue under multiple element arrangements using the residual method when vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all of the undelivered elements under the arrangement 
the company has established sufficient vsoe for the value of its consulting  training  and other services  based on the price charged when these elements are sold separately 
accordingly  software license revenues are recognized under the residual method in arrangements in which software is licensed with consulting  training or other services 
the company s products and the industries in which they compete are not static and the determination of vsoe involves judgment 
management believes that it will continue to be able to use the residual method for recognizing license revenue under multiple element arrangements 
if the company was unable to use the residual method  it could affect the timing of revenue recognition and thus the trends that the company is currently experiencing 
professional services include custom design and development and training 
the company recognizes professional services revenue under software development contracts as services are provided for per diem contracts or by using the percentage of completion method of accounting for long term fixed price contracts 
provisions for any estimated losses on contracts in progress are made in the period in which such losses become probable 
the company had no long term contracts in progress as of december  revenue from end user product sales is recognized upon delivery of the software  net of estimated returns and allowances  and if collection is probable 
the company estimates returns and allowances based on historical rates and has reduced revenue recognized for estimated future returns at the time the related revenue is recorded 
the estimates for returns are adjusted periodically based upon historical rates of return 
while management believes that it can make reliable estimates  it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates 
the company generally warrants that its products will function substantially in accordance with documentation provided to customers for approximately days following initial delivery 
as of december   the company had not incurred any expense related to warranty claims 
the company estimates reserves based on historical rates and accordingly has not recorded a warranty reserve 
while management believes that it can make reliable estimates  it is possible that these estimates will change in the future or that actual amounts could vary materially from our estimates 
please refer to note of the company s notes to consolidated financial statements for further information on its revenue recognition policies 
impairment of long lived assets in accordance with the statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  the company is required to perform an initial impairment review of its goodwill in and an annual impairment review thereafter 
the company tested recorded goodwill attributable to each reporting unit for impairment 
management conducted impairment testing as of january  and as of december  and determined that the fair value of its reporting units were greater than the carrying values for those units 
though none of the unamortized goodwill was impaired as of the initial impairment test  there can be no assurance that when a future review is completed a material impairment charge will not be recorded 
sfas no 
required certain disclosures upon adoption that the company has included in note j in the notes to the consolidated financial statements included herewith 
accounts receivable the company performs ongoing credit evaluations of its customers and adjusts credit limits based upon payment history and the customer s current credit worthiness  as determined by the company s review of their current credit information 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based on its historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that the company has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s expectations and appropriate reserves have been established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has experienced in the past 
income taxes as part of the process of preparing consolidated financial statements the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves estimating actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  such as deferred revenue  for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within its consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent the company believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  it must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the company s provision for income taxes  the company s deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the company s net deferred tax assets 
the company has fully reserved against its tax asset 
the valuation allowance is due to uncertainties related to the company s ability to utilize its deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carried forward and foreign tax credits  before they expire 
the valuation allowance is based on the company s estimates of taxable income by jurisdiction in which the company operates and the period over which its deferred tax assets will be recoverable 
the determination of the valuation allowance requires the company to make estimates  which the company cannot guarantee will prove to be accurate

all of the company s investments are short term  investment grade commercial paper  and money market accounts that are carried on the company s books at amortized cost  which approximates fair market value
