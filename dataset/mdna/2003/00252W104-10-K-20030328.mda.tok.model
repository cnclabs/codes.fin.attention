item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this report 
the notes to our consolidated financial statements set forth our critical accounting policies  including polices relating to revenue recognition  research and development expense and the use of estimates 
these policies are summarized below under critical accounting policies 
overview aaipharma inc is a science based specialty pharmaceutical company focused on the commercialization of branded pharmaceutical products that we develop or acquire 
in  the majority of our net revenues were from our product sales and product development businesses 
prior to  the majority of our net revenues were in our development services business 
major customers for our pharmaceutical products are large  well established medical wholesalers and distributors 
major customers for our development services and product development businesses are pharmaceutical and biotechnology companies 
on january   our board of directors approved a for stock split of our common shares 
on march   each stockholder received one additional share of common stock for every two shares they owned on the record date of february  all share and per share amounts have been restated to reflect the stock split for all periods presented 
pharmaceuticals division our product sales business our product sales business unit commercializes branded pharmaceutical products in our targeted therapeutic classes 
we are focused on acquiring established  branded pharmaceutical products  developing improved products and product line extensions  and marketing and promoting these products 
we currently market products under the mvi  aquasol  brethine  darvon  darvocet n and azasan brand names and  in march  we began marketing a generic calcitriol product 
product sales also include the commercial manufacturing of low volume products marketed and sold by other pharmaceutical companies 
the principal costs of this business include manufacturing costs under agreements with third party manufacturers  selling expense of our sales force and general and administrative costs of our business unit management team 
our results of operations can be influenced by the timing of purchases made by our customers 
these customers are wholesalers and may increase their purchases if they anticipate a price increase 
wholesalers may anticipate a price increase due to the timing of prior increases  the acquisition of a product by a new supplier or other reasons 
any increase in revenues during one period due to an anticipated price increase may likely be offset by decreased revenues in subsequent periods 
thus  there may be some volatility of our pharmaceutical product revenues in future periods due to the timing of our customers purchasing decisions 
research and development division our product development business our product development business unit uses our research and development expertise and capabilities to enhance and develop new drug delivery technologies and improve existing pharmaceutical products 
we apply this expertise to internally develop our own new products and improve our acquired products 
we license the developed technologies and products to customers  usually before the development is complete 
we generally receive payments for our efforts and innovations upon the occurrence of defined events  known as milestones  which are intended to help cover the costs of development 
these milestone payments are not refundable 
in most cases  we also receive royalties on the eventual sales of the product 
because of the long term nature of these projects  we may recognize revenues from milestone payments or royalties in one period and the associated expenses in prior periods 
the principal expense of this business is research and development expense  which consists primarily of labor costs  raw material expenses  third party consulting and testing costs and costs for clinical trials 
in some cases  these costs may be directly reimbursed by our customers 
aai international our development services business our development services business unit  aai international  provides a comprehensive range of development services through two primary groups  a non clinical group and a clinical group 
the non clinical group analyzes and tests various chemical compounds and provides small scale manufacturing of chemical compounds to be used for human clinical trials 
the services performed by the non clinical group also include chemical analysis  chemical synthesis  drug formulation  bio analytical testing  product life cycle management studies  and regulatory and compliance consulting 
all of these non clinical services involve either laboratory work or consulting services 
the clinical group performs testing for customers of new pharmaceutical products in humans under controlled conditions as part of the regulatory approval process for pharmaceutical products 
these clinical services involve conducting human clinical studies and the statistical analysis relating to these studies 
both the non clinical and clinical groups receive requests for services from customers  often on a competitive basis 
these projects vary in length from one month to several years 
in general  our customers may cancel a project upon days notice 
the principal expenses of this business are labor costs  including employee benefits  and equipment and facility related costs 
acquisitions darvon and darvocet n product lines on march   we acquired the us rights to the darvon and darvocet n branded product lines  which treat mild to moderate pain  and existing inventory from eli lilly  in a business combination accounted for as a purchase 
we acquired these product lines and related intangible assets for million 
to finance this acquisition  which included million of inventory  we used the proceeds from our senior secured credit facilities and senior subordinated notes  as described below in liquidity and capital resources 
the darvon and darvocet n product lines did not have separable assets and liabilities associated with them  other than inventory  therefore we allocated the purchase price  including acquisition related expenses  to acquired identifiable assets  with the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable tangible and intangible assets recorded as goodwill 
mvi and aquasol product lines on august   we acquired the mvi and aquasol branded lines of critical care injectable and oral nutritional products from astrazeneca for up to million  payable over three years 
of this amount  we paid million at closing 
we funded this purchase price with increased borrowings under our then existing senior credit facilities 
a guaranteed additional payment of million was made in august and a future guaranteed payment of million is due in august the acquisition agreement provided for future contingent payments 
a contingent payment of million would have been due in august if the fda had approved by december  the reformulated mvi product with a minimum shelf life of months 
in addition  a contingent payment of up to million is due in august if fda approval of the reformulated mvi product is received on or before december   with the million payment being reduced by million for each month after december  during which fda approval has not been obtained 
the million payment will become zero in the event fda approval is not obtained on or before december  an application for approval of this reformulated product was submitted to the fda in february these contingent obligations have not been recorded as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
the mvi and aquasol product lines did not have separable assets and liabilities associated with them other than inventory  therefore we allocated the remaining purchase price to acquired identifiable intangible assets  with the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable tangible and intangible assets recorded as goodwill 
brethine product line on december   we acquired the brethine branded line of products from novartis for million 
we used borrowings of million under our then existing senior credit facilities and cash on hand to pay the purchase price 
the brethine product line did not have separable assets and liabilities associated with it  therefore we allocated the purchase price to acquired identifiable intangible assets  with the excess of the purchase price over the identifiable intangible assets recorded as goodwill 
critical accounting policies revenue recognition net revenues 
our net revenues represent our total revenues less allowances for customer credits  including estimated discounts  rebates  chargebacks  product returns and non research and development expenses reimbursed by customers 
we accept returns of expired products 
product sales 
we recognize revenues for product sales at the time our products are shipped 
product development 
we recognize licensing revenues upon completion of interim contract milestones 
revenues from upfront licensing fees are deferred and amortized over the term of the associated agreement or as on going services are performed 
we recognize revenues for achieving contract milestones when achieved and royalty revenues as earned based on sales of the underlying products 
we bear the risk that some of the development projects may not be approved or that the eventual sales of a royalty generating product may not meet expectations 
development services 
we recognize revenues from fee for service contracts on a percentage of completion basis as the work is performed  based on the ratio of costs incurred to total estimated costs  or on a time and materials basis in accordance with the specific contract terms 
revenues recognized prior to contract billing terms are recorded as work in progress 
provisions for losses on contracts  if any  are recognized when identified 
sab in december  the securities and exchange commission  or the sec  issued staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
this bulletin specifically addresses revenue recognition issues related to certain upfront payments or fees 
under this bulletin  certain upfront fees and payments recognized as income in prior periods were required to be deferred and amortized into revenues over the terms of the relevant agreements or as the on going services were performed 
we implemented staff accounting bulletin no 
in the fourth quarter of and the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle was retroactively adopted as of the beginning of the first quarter of during the year ended december   we recorded a charge of million million after tax  or a loss of per share for the cumulative effect of this change in accounting principle 
we recognized million in and million in of revenues related to the amortization of these deferred amounts 
at december   no balance remains to be amortized into revenue in future periods 
research and development expense research and development expense consists of salaries of research and development personnel  raw material expenses  third party consulting and testing costs  and indirect costs such as management and administrative overhead and facilities costs 
research and development costs are charged to expense as incurred 
goodwill and other intangibles  net for the years ended december  and  goodwill  defined as the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of the net assets of acquired businesses  was amortized over years 
in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations sfas no 
 we ceased amortization of goodwill as of january  for purchase business combinations consummated subsequent to june   goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are not amortized  but are evaluated for impairment on an annual basis or as impairment indicators are identified 
other identifiable intangible assets are amortized  if applicable  on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives  which range from to years 
on an ongoing basis  we assess the value of our goodwill  intangibles and other assets by determining their ability to recover the unamortized balances over the remaining useful lives 
goodwill  intangibles and other long lived assets determined to be unrecoverable would be written off in the period in which such determination is made 
use of estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in our consolidated financial statements and accompanying notes 
the most significant estimates relate to the allowance for doubtful accounts  inventory reserves  sales allowances and useful lives for intangible assets 
actual results could differ from such estimates and changes in such estimates may affect amounts reported in future periods 
research and development arrangements research and development expense was of our net revenues in  and we expect research and development activities to account for between and of budgeted annual net revenues in the following product development table identifies  for each of our major development programs in  the stage of development at december  of the lead product or products in each program  research and development spending on each program in  cumulative research and development spending on each program from inception through december   an estimate of the additional research and development expense to complete the development of the lead product in the program  and the year in which we anticipate completing the lead product in the program 
the estimated additional expense to complete the lead product and the timing of completion represent our estimates 
as we continue these development programs and evaluate our interim results and other information  we may decide to change the scope and direction of a program and we may change how we allocate our research and development spending to pursue more promising product candidates 
in addition  our actual costs in developing these products may be materially different from our estimates due to uncertainties inherent in product development 
moreover  because of these inherent uncertainties  we may not be able to successfully develop  commercialize or license the products or technologies included in the table within the time periods specified  if at all

the customer will file the snda 
in addition to the specifically identified programs named in the table  we have targeted additional product development programs or projects 
these other programs or projects may require significant research and development spending in future periods 
there is a risk that any specific research and development program or project may not produce revenues 
we believe that the potential profit margins from successful development programs or projects will compensate for costs incurred for unsuccessful projects 
we are currently involved in many pharmaceutical and technology development programs or projects and believe that these activities help to diversify our portfolio and manage our risk 
see risk factors contained elsewhere in this report 
significant development agreement we have a development agreement with a customer that provides for us to receive contingent periodic payments based on sales of the customer s product and obligates the customer to use us on a fee for service basis for a product life cycle management project related to the product 
the development agreement relates to a product with respect to which we have licensed intellectual property that we developed in the past 
we have recognized product development revenues under this agreement for the periodic payments based on product sales  and have recognized development services revenue related to the product life cycle management project 
product development revenues from this agreement were million in  million in and million in we recognized no research and development expense in  and associated with the payments we received in  and the expense of our work associated with these revenues was recognized primarily in  and we do not anticipate incurring significant expense associated with the product development revenues under this agreement in future periods 
development services revenue associated with this agreement were million in  million in and million in because of the research and development nature of our activities in this product life cycle management project and the potential that these activities could result in continuation of product development revenues into the future  we have recorded our costs incurred in this project as research and development expense million in  million in and million in accordingly  for our development services business unit  we have recognized no expense associated with the development services revenue arising under this agreement  as this expense was recognized by our product development business unit 
we amended this agreement in december as amended  the agreement provides that  if we remain available to provide the customer with development and formulation services for an identified class of pharmaceutical products on an exclusive basis as to third parties in a calendar quarter  we will be entitled to fees based on the level of sales over a prior monthly period of the product that was the subject of our development work 
the customer is obligated to make these quarterly payments based on whether defined market events have occurred in the prior measurement month eg  if the defined market events have not occurred during three consecutive months  we would be entitled to fees in three consecutive quarters  with  for example  the amount of the fees in the first quarter being based on product sales in the first month 
however  if we do not continue to provide these development and formulation services on an exclusive basis as to third parties in any quarter  we will not be entitled to these fees for that quarter and all subsequent quarters 
under the agreement  we have the right  at any time  to terminate our obligation to provide the development and formulation services on an exclusive basis 
accordingly  we will not recognize product development revenues under this agreement in any quarter until we have satisfied the exclusivity requirement for that quarter 
we believe that we will be entitled to product development fees through the first quarter of if we continue to provide the development services to the customer on an exclusive basis during those periods 
we believe that the annual amount of fees due in will be in the range of million to million  in will be in the range of million to million  and in the first quarter of will be in the range of million to million 
currently  we do not expect to receive product development fees in subsequent future periods 
the development agreement also requires the customer to use a minimum amount of our development services at standard rates on the product life cycle management project in specified calendar quarters 
in  the amount of research work we performed for the customer on this project was significantly greater than the minimum amount  and during the project wound down to the minimum contractual levels 
the customer is obligated to continue the project at minimum levels through results of operations the following table presents the net revenues for each of our business units and our consolidated expenses and net income loss and each item expressed as a percentage of consolidated net revenues years ended december  dollars in thousands net revenues product sales product development development services direct costs excluding depreciation selling general and administrative depreciation and amortization research and development direct pharmaceutical start up costs income from operations interest expense  net provision for benefit from income taxes net income loss year ended december  compared to year ended december  our consolidated net revenues for the year ended december  increased to million  from million in the same period of net revenues from product sales increased to million in  from million in  due to sales of our mvi  aquasol and brethine products  which we acquired in the second half of  and sales of darvon and darvocet n  which we acquired at the end of the first quarter of net revenues from commercial manufacturing of products marketed by other pharmaceutical companies  which is included in product sales  contributed million and million to net revenues from product sales in and  respectively 
net revenues from product development decreased in to million  from million in  primarily due to a decrease in third party licensing revenues  partially offset by an increase in product development revenues under our significant development agreement  as described above in significant development agreement  which increased from million in to million in our expenses associated with the development work performed under this agreement were recognized as incurred  primarily in  and no significant expense was associated with the product development revenues recognized in  or net revenues from our development services business decreased in to million  from million in this decrease was principally attributable to the redeployment of a portion of our internal resources from external revenue producing projects to research and development projects relating to our own pharmaceutical products  both current and future  as well as other market factors 
this redeployment of resources is a strategic decision we have made to expand our proprietary product development pipeline through the increased use of our development service fee for service segment s core competencies 
this strategy allows us to better control project flow  at lower costs  and accordingly  we believe this trend will continue into future years  reflecting the development of our proprietary product pipeline 
gross margin dollars  or net revenues less direct costs  increased million  or  to million  from million in  reflecting our increased net revenues in over the prior year 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross margin dollars increased to in from in gross margin dollars from our product sales business increased million  to million in  from million in  with a gross margin percentage of in  compared to in the higher margins generated by our product sales business were partially offset by decreases in revenues and gross margin percentage from our development services business in  reflecting the redeployment of resources discussed above 
selling expenses increased in to million  from million in this increase is principally due to additional selling expenses incurred by our product sales business associated with marketing and promoting our entire product line  maintaining and enhancing distribution channels  and growing and developing our product sales force 
as a percentage of net revenues  selling expenses in increased slightly from at the end of  we had pharmaceutical product sales representatives  as compared to at the end of this amount increased to sales representatives in january we anticipate our sales representatives to increase to approximately by the end of general and administrative costs increased in to million  from million in this increase was primarily due to expenses related to the management build up for our product sales business 
as a percentage of net revenues  general and administrative expenses in decreased to  from in research and development expenses were approximately of net revenues  or million  in  an increase from of net revenues  or million  in this increase resulted primarily from clinical trials started in for our prosorb d pain management product and line extension development of our critical care products 
there were no direct pharmaceutical start up costs recorded in  as compared to million in these costs were incurred prior to our acquisition of any pharmaceutical product lines in and were expensed as incurred 
consolidated income from operations was million in  or million higher than the prior year  and is due to the expansion of our product sales business 
income from operations for our product sales business was million in  compared to million in the prior year 
this increase is attributable to the revenues and gross margin generated from our product line acquisitions 
income from operations for our product development business was million in  compared to income from operations of million in this change resulted from the decreased revenues under our significant development agreement  as discussed above 
we recorded income from operations for our development services business of million in  compared to income from operations of million in this decrease is primarily due to the decline in development services revenue  as described above 
unallocated corporate expenses increased in to million  from million in this increase was due to additions to our corporate infrastructure to accommodate our expansion and increased legal fees to support our intellectual property 
as a percentage of net revenues  unallocated corporate expenses in decreased to  from in net interest expense increased to million in  from million in this increase is primarily attributable to the net borrowings that funded our product line acquisitions 
these borrowings are discussed below in liquidity and capital resources 
we recorded a tax provision of million in  based on an effective tax rate of 
this rate is approximately equal to the statutory rate 
our effective tax rate for was  which reflected the utilization of tax loss carryforwards generated by our european operations 
in march  we recorded an extraordinary loss of million  net of a tax benefit of million  to record the write off of deferred financing and other costs related to our prior debt facilities 
year ended december  compared to year ended december  our net revenues for the year ended december  increased to million  from million in this increase was primarily due to the acquisition by our pharmaceutical products business unit of the mvi  aquasol and brethine branded products and an increase of million of net revenues associated with our significant development agreement  described above 
net revenues from product sales increased in to million  from million in  due to sales of our mvi  aquasol and brethine products after we acquired them 
net revenues from product sales in and prior periods consist of revenues from commercial manufacturing of products marketed by other pharmaceutical companies 
net revenues from commercial manufacturing contributed million and million to net revenues from product sales in and  respectively 
net revenues from product development increased in to million  from million in  primarily due to a increase  or an increase of million  of product development revenues under an agreement described above in significant development agreement 
our expenses associated with the development work performed under this agreement were recognized primarily in  and no significant expense was associated with the product development revenues recognized in or net revenues from our development services business increased in to million  from million in this increase was primarily attributable to revenues generated from significant new phase iii clinical trial contracts that we entered into in the second half of  including amendments to those contracts  in net revenues from our development services business associated with our significant development agreement described above decreased in to million  from million in gross margin dollars  or net revenues less direct costs  increased million  or  to million  from million in  reflecting our increased net revenues in over the prior year 
as a percentage of net revenues  gross margin dollars decreased slightly to in from in gross margin dollars from our product sales business increased million in  from million in  with a gross margin percentage of in additionally  gross margin dollars from our product development business increased to million in from million in  benefiting significantly from the million of product development revenues from our significant development agreement 
these higher margins generated by our product sales and product development businesses were offset by the lower gross margin percentage of our development services business in  reflecting a significant increase in lower margin clinical revenues and decrease in higher margin fee for service revenues under our significant development agreement 
selling expenses increased in to million  from million in this increase was primarily due to additional selling expenses incurred by our product sales business associated with marketing and promoting our new products  maintaining and enhancing distribution channels  and developing our product sales force 
general and administrative costs increased in to million  from million in this increase was primarily due to increases in employee benefits and legal fees related to protecting our intellectual property rights 
research and development expenses were approximately of net revenues  or million  in  a decrease from of net revenues  or million  in this decrease was primarily attributable to the winding down in of a significant product life cycle management project associated with the significant development agreement  described above 
the direct pharmaceutical start up costs of million in represent costs of developing our pharmaceutical products organizational and marketing infrastructure 
these costs were incurred prior to our acquisition of any product lines and were expensed as incurred in accordance with the american institute of certified public accountants statement of position  reporting on the costs of start up activities 
upon the acquisition of our first product line in august  we began classifying similar costs as selling or general and administrative costs  as appropriate 
net interest expense increased in to million  from million in this million increase was primarily attributable to the borrowings in that funded our product line acquisitions 
income from operations was million in  an million increase over the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to the expansion of our product sales business and an increase in product development revenues with low associated expenses from our significant development agreement described above 
this increase was offset by a decrease in income from operations in our development services business caused by the changing mix of revenues in that business 
we recorded income from operations for our product sales business of million in  compared to a loss from operations of million in the prior year 
this increase was primarily attributable to our acquisitions of the mvi  aquasol and brethine product lines during we recorded income from operations for our product development business of million in  compared to income from operations of million in this resulted from increases in net revenues related to our significant development agreement 
we recorded income from operations for our development services business of million in  compared to million in this decrease was primarily due to the changing mix of development services revenue  with a significant increase in lower margin clinical revenues and a decline in higher margin product life cycle management revenues 
unallocated corporate expenses increased by in to million  from million in this higher level was attributable to additions to our corporate infrastructure to accommodate the expansion of our overall business 
we recorded a tax provision of million in  based on an effective tax rate of 
this rate was slightly higher than the statutory rate due principally to permanent differences of million 
we recorded a net deferred tax asset of million at december  liquidity and capital resources historically  we have funded our businesses with cash flows provided by operations and proceeds from borrowings 
cash flow provided by operations in was million  up from million in this increase was primarily due to the increases in net income and accrued interest payable on our senior subordinated notes  partially offset by increases in accounts receivable and inventories related to the product lines we acquired  and prepaid financing fees related to the financing of our darvon and darvocet n acquisition 
cash flow provided by operations subsequent to the darvon and darvocet n acquisition on march  was million 
cash used in investing activities was million in this included million related to our acquisition of the darvon and darvocet n branded product lines as further described below  and million for the purchase of assets formerly covered by our tax retention operating lease  including our corporate headquarters in wilmington  nc and a laboratory and clinical facility in chapel hill  nc capital expenditures were million during capital assets purchased during were primarily related to purchases of information technology hardware and software  upgrading and replacing laboratory equipment and setting up and transferring the production for our acquired products 
cash provided by financing activities during was million  primarily representing net proceeds of million in additional borrowings under our new debt facilities  as described below  million related to the unamortized proceeds from the sales of our interest rate swaps and million of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options  partially offset by the repayment of million of borrowings in the last nine months of in  million of cash flow was provided by operations  an increase of million over this was primarily due to our improved management of working capital  which was strongly influenced by the timing of transactions  including our receipt of million of product development payments associated with our significant development agreement described above and the collection of a significant receivable associated with this agreement 
our working capital improvement was partially offset by additional working capital needed for the mvi  aquasol and brethine product lines 
during  cash used in investing activities was million  which was primarily related to our acquisition of these branded product lines 
capital expenditures were million during  and in march  we completed a sale leaseback transaction on manufacturing equipment  which provided cash of million 
cash provided by financing activities during was million  primarily representing net proceeds of million in borrowings to fund our product line acquisitions and million of cash proceeds from the exercise of stock options  offset by repayments under our revolving credit facility of million 
in  million of cash was provided by operations  benefiting from cash generated under our significant development agreement and improved working capital management 
during  cash used in investing activities was million  primarily consisting of capital expenditures of million 
cash used in financing activities during was million  of which million represented repayments of borrowings 
on march   we acquired the us rights to the darvon and darvocet n branded product lines and existing inventory from eli lilly and company for million in cash  subject to potential reduction based on the net sales of these products after the closing of the acquisition 
in connection with the acquisition  we entered into million of senior credit facilities  issued million of senior subordinated notes due  repaid all million of borrowings outstanding under our prior senior credit facilities  and terminated our tax retention operating lease and purchased the underlying properties 
our million senior secured credit facilities consist of a million five year revolving credit facility and a million five year term loan facility 
the term loan facility amortizes over the full five year term 
the senior facilities were subsequently reduced to million due to the million of repayments we made under the term loan facility 
the availability of borrowings under our revolving credit facility is not limited by a borrowing base 
our senior credit facilities provide for variable interest rates based on libor or an alternate base rate  at our option 
such facilities are guaranteed by all of our domestic subsidiaries and secured by a security interest on substantially all of our domestic assets  all of the stock of our domestic subsidiaries  and of the stock of our material foreign subsidiaries 
our senior credit facilities require the payment of certain commitment fees based on the unused portion of the revolving credit facility 
under the terms of the credit agreement for our senior credit facilities  we are required to comply with various covenants including  but not limited to  those pertaining to maintenance of certain financial ratios and incurrence of additional indebtedness 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  these senior credit facilities may be prepaid at our option at any time without a premium 
on march   we issued million of senior subordinated unsecured notes due these notes have a fixed interest rate of per annum and are guaranteed on a subordinated basis by all of our existing domestic subsidiaries and all of our future domestic subsidiaries of which we own or more of the equity interests 
prior to march   up to of the notes are redeemable with the proceeds of qualified sales of equity at of par value 
the terms of our senior credit facilities require us to repay all of the indebtedness under these facilities before we could repurchase any of the notes 
on or after march   all or any portion of the notes are redeemable at declining premiums to par value  beginning at 
under the terms of the indenture for the notes  we are required to comply with various covenants including  but not limited to  a covenant relating to incurrence of additional indebtedness 
we were in compliance with these covenants at december  concurrent with the issuance of our senior subordinated notes  we entered into an interest rate swap agreement to effectively convert interest expense on million of senior subordinated notes for the term of the notes from an fixed annual rate to a floating annual rate equal to month libor plus a base rate 
on may   august  and september   we sold the then outstanding swap agreements for million  million and million  respectively 
the amounts we received  less the interest benefit earned through the dates of sale  have been recorded as a premium to the carrying amount of the notes and are being amortized into interest income over their remaining life 
at december   we had an interest rate swap agreement in place covering million of the notes  at a rate of month libor plus 
under this agreement  month libor was locked at  giving us an all in rate of 
on february   this interest rate swap was sold for million  and a new swap was entered covering million of the notes  at a rate of month libor plus  giving us an estimated all in rate of 
the terms of these interest rate swap agreements  other than the notional amount and the base rate  were identical and were perfectly matched with the terms of the related hedged instrument 
on december  and february   month libor was and  respectively 
the following schedule summarizes contractual obligations and commitments at december  in thousands over over one three one year through through over five or less three years five years years total long term debt operating leases capital lease obligations purchase commitments our purchase commitments are primarily related to outstanding orders with suppliers to purchase finished goods related to our pharmaceutical products 
our liquidity needs increased significantly during  and our annual net interest expense may exceed million in the mvi and aquasol acquisition agreement provided for a million guaranteed payment in august  and future contingent payments of million and million potentially due in august and august  respectively  depending on the status of certain reformulation activities being carried out by astrazeneca 
as previously discussed  the conditions to the contingent payments were not met by the required date  so that the million amount is no longer a contingent obligation of ours and the potential million contingent payment is decreasing by million for each full month that the conditions continue to be unmet 
if such conditions are not satisfied by december   the remaining contingent payment obligation to astrazeneca will decrease to zero 
in addition  we may have to make contingent payments of million over four years in connection with the purchase of our charleston  south carolina manufacturing facility  based on the level of manufacturing revenues at this facility 
these contingent payment obligations  including the contingent payments potentially due in connection with the acquisition of the mvi and aquasol product lines  have not yet been recorded as a liability on our consolidated balance sheet 
we have million of principal repayments due in the next twelve months under our senior credit facilities and will make interest payments on the senior subordinated notes of million in april and october these interest payments will be reduced by approximately million and million to be received under our interest rate swap agreement in april and october  respectively 
we believe that our senior credit facilities and cash flow provided by operations will be sufficient to fund near term growth and fund our guaranteed and contingent payment obligations arising from our acquisitions 
we may require additional financing to pursue other acquisition opportunities or for other reasons 
we may from time to time seek to obtain additional funds through the public or private issuance of equity or debt securities 
while we remain confident that we can obtain additional financing  if necessary  we cannot assure you that additional financing will be available or that the terms will be acceptable to us 
related party transactions in  as part of our internal development program  we organized endeavor pharmaceuticals  inc to continue development of products that we had been developing on our own and to permit investors to directly invest in the development of these products 
we assigned our rights to these products to endeavor in return for approximately of endeavor s fully diluted equity 
as a result of additional issuances of equity by endeavor to third party investors  our fully diluted ownership interest in endeavor has been reduced to approximately 
as of december   dr 
frederick d 
sancilio  our executive chairman and chief scientific officer  owned of endeavor s fully diluted equity and an affiliate of james l 
waters  one of our directors  owned 
we had net revenues for services provided to endeavor at our standard rates of approximately million in  million in and million in we had approximately million and million in related accounts receivable at december  and  respectively 
we organized aesgen  inc with an affiliate of the mayo clinic in and funded it in with an affiliate of the mayo clinic  mova pharmaceutical corporation and certain other investors to combine our development capabilities with the medical expertise of the mayo clinic and to permit investors to directly invest in the development of these products 
we distributed our initial common stock investment in aesgen to our shareholders prior to our initial public offering in as a result  some of our directors  executive officers and holders of or more of common stock who held our stock prior to the initial public offering beneficially own common equity of aesgen 
in the aggregate they own less than of aesgen s fully diluted common equity
