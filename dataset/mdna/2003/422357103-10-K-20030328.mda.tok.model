use of estimates the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
significant estimates used in the preparation of the financial statements include the value of the class b interest which represents the collateral of the heartland technology  inc note receivable owed to the company and cmc  estimated costs to complete long term development projects  the collectability of the mr 
jacobson  former president and chief executive officer of cmc  note and interest receivable  estimated bad debt expense  the recoverability of the total cost of properties and the estimates used in determining the company s environmental liabilities 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
income taxes a publicly traded partnership generally is not liable for federal income taxes  provided that for each taxable year at least of its gross income consists of certain passive types of income 
in such case  each partner includes its proportionate share of partnership income or loss in its own tax return 
accordingly  no provision for income taxes is reflected in heartland s financial statements 
heartland s assets are carried at historical cost 
at december  and  the tax basis of the properties and improvements for federal income tax purposes was greater than their carrying value for financial reporting purposes 
segment reporting the company does not report by business segment since the land held for sale revenues and expenses are not material to the company s overall business operations 
property properties are carried at their historical cost 
expenditures which significantly improve the values or extend useful lives of the properties are capitalized 
predevelopment costs including real estate taxes that are directly identified with a specific development project are capitalized 
interest and related debt issuance costs are capitalized to qualifying real estate inventories as incurred  in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 capitalization of interest costs  and charged to cost of sales as revenue from residential and land sales are recognized 
repairs and maintenance are charged to expense as incurred 
depreciation is provided for financial statement purposes over the estimated useful life of the respective assets ranging from years for office equipment and fixtures to years for building and improvements using the straight line method 
properties held for development  including capitalized predevelopment costs  are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances  such as a condemnation proceeding being brought by a governmental agency against the company or the discovery of an environmental liability related to a particular site  indicate that the carrying amount of the particular development property may not be recoverable 
if these events or changes in circumstances are present  the company estimates the sum of the expected future cash flows undiscounted to result from the development operations and eventual disposition of the particular development property  and if less than the carrying amount of the development property  the company will recognize an impairment loss based on discounted cash flows 
upon recognition of any impairment loss  the company would measure that loss based on the amount by which the carrying amount of the property exceeds the estimated fair value of the property 
no event occurred during the years and that resulted in an impairment loss being recognized 
for properties held for sale  an impairment loss is recognized when the fair value of the property  less the estimated cost to sell  is less than the carrying amount of the property 
no event occurred during the years and that resulted in an impairment loss being recognized 
housing inventories including completed model homes consisting of land  land development  direct and indirect construction costs and related interest  are recorded at cost  which is not in excess of fair value 
land  land development and indirect costs are allocated to cost of sales on the basis of units closed in relation to the total anticipated units in the related development project  such allocation approximates the relative sales value method 
direct construction costs are allocated to the specific units closed for purposes of determining costs of sales 
selling and marketing costs  not including those costs incurred related to furnishing and developing the models and sales office  are expensed in the period incurred 
costs incurred in the construction of the model units and related furnishings are capitalized at cost 
the company intends to offer these units for sale at the completion of a project and  accordingly  no amortization of direct construction costs is provided 
housing inventories are reviewed for impairment whenever events or circumstances indicate the fair value less the cost to dispose of the inventories  is less than the capitalized costs 
if these events or changes in circumstances are present  the company then writes down the inventory to its fair value 
no event occurred during the years and that resulted in an impairment loss being recognized 
housing inventories consisted of the following at december  and amounts in thousands land under development   direct construction costs   capitalized project costs   total   liquidity and capital resources cash flow for operating activities has been derived primarily from development activities  proceeds of property sales  rental income and interest income 
cash was  including  of restricted cash at december    including  of restricted cash at december  and  including  of restricted cash at december  the decrease in cash of  from december  to december   is primarily due to the return to the company on april  of the  interest reserve held by lnb as collateral for the lnb line of credit and the subsequent use by the company to reduce accounts payable 
the decrease in cash of  from december  to december   is primarily due to the closing of kinzie station phase i units and the return of all of the kinzie station phase ii purchasers earnest money 
see the consolidated statements of cash flows 
net cash used in operating activities was  in compared to  of net cash provided by operating activities in the year the cash provided by operating activities from the year compared to the year decreased by  this is primarily due to housing inventories decreasing  in compared to  in  which is a difference of  the difference is attributable to closing units in in kinzie station phase i compared to units in also  net additions to capitalized predevelopment costs increased  in compared to  in  which is a difference of  this difference is attributable to the company not selling any development properties during the year net cash provided by operating activities was  in  compared to  in the cash provided by operating activities from the year compared to the year decreased by  this is primarily due to housing inventories decreasing  in compared to  in  which is a difference of  this difference is attributable to closing units in in kinzie station phase i compared to units in also  the net cash used to reduce accounts payable and accrued liabilities in was  as compared to of  this is an increase of  in cash used in operating activities between the years 
see the consolidated statements of cash flows 
during the year  cash flows to pay development and homebuilding construction costs will be provided by property sales proceeds and development  construction and line of credit loans received from various sources 
proceeds from property sales provided cash flow of  in   in and  in sales in consists primarily of units in kinzie station phase i for  units in longleaf for  and various land held for sale parcels for  sales in consists primarily of units in kinzie station phase i for  units in longleaf for  acres of land in rosemount  minnesota for  acres of land in bozeman  montana for  and acres of land in kinzie station phase ii for  sales in consists primarily of units in kinzie phase i for  units in osprey cove for  units in longleaf for  units and developed acreage in rosemount for  acres at galewood in chicago  illinois for  and acres at kinzie station in chicago  illinois for  during the year  proceeds from property sales will consist primarily of the sale of longleaf homes  development properties and land held for sale acreage 
the cost of property sales for was  or of sales proceeds  for was  or of sales proceeds and for was  or of sales proceeds 
it is not expected that future cost of sales ratios for real estate other than development projects and home sales will change materially from ratios experienced in prior years  as the balance of heartland s real estate other than development projects consists primarily of railroad properties acquired over the past years at values far lower than current fair values 
portfolio income is derived principally from the interest earned on the hti note receivable  interest earned on certificates of deposit and investment of cash not required for operating activities in overnight investments 
portfolio income for was  compared to  for and  for the decrease in portfolio income from to the year of  is mainly attributable to a decrease in interest earned on the hti note receivable of  heartland stopped accruing interest on the hti note receivable april  due to the uncertainty regarding the collectibility of the hti note receivable 
the increase in portfolio income from the year to the year of  is mainly attributable to additional interest earned on the hti note receivable of  and interest earned of  on the delayed closing of the acres in rosemount  minnesota 
as of december   heartland had designated sites  or approximately acres with a book value of approximately  for sale and development 
capitalized expenditures at these sites were  in   in and  in at december  and  capitalized costs on development properties including housing inventories totaled  and  respectively 
expenditures which significantly increase the value and are directly identified with a specific project are capitalized 
at december   land held for sale consists of  acres with a book value of  land held for sale will be disposed of in an orderly fashion  however  it is anticipated that the disposal of such properties may extend beyond the year the company is also exploring the sale of these properties as a whole to a third party 
it is the company s practice to evaluate environmental liabilities associated with the company s properties 
heartland monitors the potential exposure to environmental costs on a regular basis and has recorded a liability in the amount of  at december  and  at december  for possible environmental liabilities  including remediation  legal and consulting fees 
a reserve is established with regard to potential environmental liabilities when it is probable that a liability has been incurred and the amount of the liability can be reasonably estimated 
the amount of any liability is determined independently from any claim for recovery 
if the amount of the liability cannot be reasonably estimated  but management is able to determine that the amount of the liability is likely to fall within a range  and no amount within that range can be determined to be the better estimate  then a reserve in the minimum amount of the range is accrued 
if the company were to use a different approach  the reserve could be materially higher 
estimates can be affected by various uncertainties including future changes in technology  changes in regulations or requirements of local governmental authorities  third party claims  the scope and cost to be performed at each site  the portion of costs that may be shared and the timing of the remediation work 
at december   there is not sufficient information to reasonably estimate all the environmental liabilities of which management is aware 
accordingly  management is unable to determine whether environmental liabilities which management is unable to reasonably estimate will or will not have a material effect on heartland s results of operations or financial condition 
as additional information becomes available  the company will reassess its reserves which may then be modified and related charges credits against earnings may then be made 
in addition  heartland has established an allowance for resolution of non environmental claims of  and  at december  and  respectively  related to certain unresolved claims that were transferred to cmc as part of a conveyance of certain real properties at the time of formation of the partnership 
heartland does not at this time anticipate that these claims or assessments will have a material effect on the company s liquidity  financial position and results of operations beyond the reserve which the company has established for such claims and assessments 
in making this evaluation  the company has assumed that the company will continue to be able to assert the bankruptcy bar arising from the reorganization of its predecessor and that resolution of current pending and threatened claims and assessments will be consistent with the company s experience with similar previously asserted claims and assessments 
while the timing of the payment of environmental claims has not significantly adversely effected the company s cash flow or liquidity in the past  management is not able to reasonably anticipate whether future payments may or may not have a significant adverse effect in the future 
notwithstanding  at december   there is not sufficient information to reasonably estimate all the environmental liabilities of which management is aware 
accordingly  management is unable to determine whether environmental liabilities which management is unable to reasonably estimate will or will not have a material effect on heartland s results of operations or financial condition 
at december   hti owed heartland and cmc approximately  on february   the company and cmc demanded immediate payment in full of all obligations due under the line of credit promissory notes from hti 
heartland has initiated steps to protect its security interest in the class b interest the collateral 
pg oldco  inc  a creditor of hti under notes aggregating  in principal amount  also has a security interest in the collateral and has commenced steps to protect its interest 
under the lien subordination and inter creditor agreement inter creditor agreement among heartland  cmc  pg oldco  inc and hti  heartland and cmc have a first and prior security interest in the collateral and the proceeds thereof up to the senior debt priority amount as defined in the inter creditor agreement and pg oldco  inc has a first and prior security interest in the collateral and the proceeds thereof for all amounts in excess of the senior debt priority amount 
because of the competing interests in the collateral  heartland is negotiating with pg oldco  inc a settlement of this matter 
the settlement is likely to involve cmc buying the pg oldco  inc notes for approximately  heartland has recorded an allowance of approximately  on the note receivable balance of  based on the proposed terms of the settlement of approximately  and the december  class b interest capital account balance of heartland s management believes it will have sufficient funds available for operating expenses  but anticipates the necessity of utilizing outside financing to fund development projects 
as of december   the company has a line of credit with lasalle national bank lnb in the amount of  heartland has also granted lnb  as collateral for the line of credit  a first lien on certain parcels of land in chicago  illinois 
the net worth requirement for the line of credit is  advances against the line of credit bear interest at the prime rate of lnb plus at december  
the line of credit will mature on march  at december  and   and  respectively  had been advanced to heartland by lnb against the line of credit 
on february   the company closed on the sale of approximately acres of land in chicago  illinois at a price of  at that time the outstanding lnb line of credit balance of  was paid in full 
if heartland is not successful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund the implementation of its business strategy and other expenditures  development projects may be delayed or abandoned 
no assurance can be given that such financing will be available or  if available  will be on terms favorable to heartland 
the consolidated financial statements do not contain any adjustments to reflect the ultimate outcome of this uncertainty 
at december  the company had capital and operating lease obligations of the following total capital leases   operating leases     model home rent two officers of heartland    total     results of operations for the year ended december   operations resulted in a net loss of  or per class a unit 
operations for the years ended december  and resulted in a net income of  and  or and per class a unit  respectively 
the differences in net loss in compared to the net income in and in net income in compared to the net income in of  and  respectively  are primarily due to a decrease in sales volume for those years 
total operating expenses for were  compared to  for and  for the decrease of  in compared to is primarily due to decreased selling expenses of  offset by an increase in bad debt expense of  the decrease of  in compared to is primarily due to decreased general and administrative expenses of  economic and other conditions generally the real estate industry is highly cyclical and is affected by changes in national  global and local economic conditions and events  such as employment levels  availability of financing  interest rates  consumer confidence and the demand for housing and other types of construction 
real estate developers are subject to various risks  many of which are outside the control of the developer  including real estate market conditions  changing demographic conditions  adverse weather conditions and natural disasters  such as hurricanes and tornadoes  delays in construction schedules  cost overruns  changes in government regulations or requirements  increases in real estate taxes and other local government fees and availability and cost of land  materials and labor 
the occurrence of any of the foregoing could have a material adverse effect on the financial condition of heartland 
access to financing the real estate business is capital intensive and requires expenditures for land and infrastructure development  housing construction and working capital 
accordingly  heartland anticipates incurring additional indebtedness to fund their real estate development activities 
as of december   heartland s total consolidated indebtedness was  this amount is due within one year from january  there can be no assurance that the amounts available from internally generated funds  cash on hand  heartland s existing credit facilities and sale of non strategic assets will be sufficient to fund heartland s anticipated operations 
heartland may be required to seek additional capital in the form of equity or debt financing from a variety of potential sources  including additional bank financing and sales of debt or equity securities 
no assurance can be given that such financing will be available or  if available  will be on terms favorable to heartland 
if heartland is not successful in obtaining sufficient capital to fund the implementation of its business strategy and other expenditures  development projects may be delayed or abandoned 
any such delay or abandonment could result in a reduction in sales and would adversely affect heartland s future results of operations 
management does not have any intention to abandon any projects 
period to period fluctuations heartland s real estate projects are long term in nature 
sales activity varies from period to period  and the ultimate success of any development cannot always be determined from results in any particular period or periods 
thus  the timing and amount of revenues arising from capital expenditures are subject to considerable uncertainty 
the inability of heartland to manage effectively their cash flows from operations would have an adverse effect on their ability to service debt  and to meet working capital requirements 
interest rate sensitivity the company s total consolidated indebtedness at december  is  the company pays interest on its outstanding borrowings under revolving credit facilities and fixed loan amounts at prime or the prime rate plus and at a fixed rate of 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
an adverse change of in the prime rate would increase the yearly interest incurred by approximately  the company does not have any other financial instruments for which there is a significant exposure to interest rate changes
