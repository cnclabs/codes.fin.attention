autodesk subscription program in addition to sales of new software licenses and upgrades  we offer customers a subscription option 
the autodesk subscription program is available for a majority of our design solution products as well as discreet s ds max 
under the program  members who own the most recent version of the underlying product participate in a simplified upgrade process  feature enhancing extensions  downloadable e learning courses and optional on line support 
users benefit from incremental product releases and extensions 
product development and introduction we continue to enhance our product offerings and develop new products to meet changing customer demands 
research and development expenditures amounted to of fiscal revenues 
the majority of our basic research and product development is performed in the us  while translation and localization of foreign market versions  as well as some product development  is performed by development teams or contractors in our local markets 
we generally translate and localize our products into french  italian  german  spanish  japanese and various chinese dialects 
various aspects of our product related functions  including software development  localization  quality assurance and technical publications  are performed in canada  europe and asia 
the technology industry is characterized by rapid technological change in computer hardware  operating systems and software  as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences 
to keep pace with these changes  we maintain an aggressive program of new product development to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data created by our products 
we dedicate considerable technical and financial resources to research and development to further enhance our existing products and to create new products and technologies 
these investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs or our competitors may introduce new products and services that achieve acceptance among our current customers  either of which would likely adversely affect our competitive position 
our software products are complex and  despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects 
these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products  damage to our reputation  loss of revenues  an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products  any of which would likely harm our business 
we actively recruit and hire experienced software developers and license and acquire complementary software technologies and businesses 
in addition  we actively collaborate with and support independent software developers who offer products that enhance and complement our products 
independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities  while other technologies are licensed from third parties 
licenses may restrict use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business 
we generally either own or license the software developed by third parties 
because talented development personnel are in high demand  independent developers  including those who currently develop products for us  may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future 
similarly  we may not be able to obtain and renew existing license agreements on favorable terms  if at all  and any failure to do so would likely harm our business 
our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with third party developers  who provide products that expand the functionality of our software 
some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn 
in particular markets  this disruption could negatively impact these third party developers and end users  which could harm our business 
marketing and sales we sell our products and services both directly to customers  which include large corporations  and through established distributors and resellers 
our customer related operations are divided into three geographic regions  the americas  europe and asia pacific  and are supported by global marketing and sales organizations 
these organizations develop and manage overall marketing and sales programs and work closely with a network of domestic and foreign offices 
we also work directly with reseller and distributor sales organizations  computer manufacturers  other software developers and peripheral manufacturers in cooperative advertising  promotions and trade show presentations 
we employ mass marketing techniques such as web casts  seminars  telemarketing  direct mailings and advertising in business and trade journals 
we have a worldwide user group organization dedicated to the exchange of information related to the use of our products 
our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller network 
computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction  such as current worldwide economic conditions  and may do so in the future 
in addition  the changing distribution models resulting from the internet  from increased focus on direct sales to major accounts or from two tiered distribution may impact our reseller network in the future 
while no single customer  distributor or reseller accounted for more than percent of our consolidated net revenues in any of the past three fiscal years  the loss of  or a significant reduction in  business or failure to achieve anticipated levels of sell through with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business 
we intend to continue to make our products available in foreign languages 
we believe that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues 
we are in a time of significant political unrest and economic troubles 
continued economic weakness in any of the countries which contribute a significant portion of our net revenues would likely have a material adverse effect on our business 
a summary of our financial information by geographic location is found in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
customer and reseller support through our autodesk professional services division for design solutions products and through discreet for its products  we provide technical support and training to customers through a leveraged model  augmented by programs designed to address specific direct needs 
we expect that end users rely primarily on their resellers and distributors for technical support 
we support the resellers and distributors through technical product training  sales training classes  the internet and direct telephone support 
support content is also available on the product support portion of our internet site 
there are also a number of user group forums in which customers are able to share information 
while we expect the resellers and distributors to provide the majority of technical support to our customers  we have developed programs to deliver direct support to some customers 
developer programs one of our key strategies is to maintain an open architecture design of our software products to facilitate third party development of complementary products and industry specific software solutions 
this approach enables customers and third parties to customize our products for a wide variety of highly specific uses 
we offer several programs that provide marketing  sales  technical support and programming tools to developers who develop add on applications for our products 
backlog we typically ship products shortly after receipt of an order  which is common in the computer software industry 
accordingly  we do not maintain a significant backlog 
moreover  the backlog as of any particular date gives no indication of actual sales for any succeeding period 
competition we compete with a variety of companies in different aspects of our business 
the software industry has limited barriers to entry  and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance capacity at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry 
the markets in which we compete are fairly mature and characterized by vigorous competition  both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies 
in addition  the availability of third party application software is a competitive factor within the cad market 
because of these and other factors  competitive conditions in these industries are likely to continue to intensify in the future 
increased competition could result in price reductions  reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share  any of which could harm our business 
furthermore  some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources 
we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer new products and to continue to provide existing product offerings that compete favorably with respect to reliability  performance  ease of use  range of useful features  continuing product enhancements  reputation  price and training 
intellectual property and licenses we protect our intellectual property through a combination of patents  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions 
nonetheless  our intellectual property rights may not be successfully asserted in the future or may be invalidated  circumvented or challenged 
in addition  the laws of various foreign countries where our products are distributed do not protect our intellectual property rights to the same extent as us laws 
our inability to protect our proprietary information could harm our business 
from time to time  we receive claims alleging infringement of a third party s intellectual property rights  including patents 
litigation often becomes more likely in times of economic downturn 
disputes involving our intellectual property rights or those of another party have in the past and may in the future lead to  among other things  costly litigation or product shipment delays  which could harm our business 
we retain ownership of software we develop 
all software is licensed to users and provided in object code pursuant to either shrink wrap  embedded or on line licenses  or executed license agreements 
these agreements contain restrictions on duplication  disclosure and transfer 
we believe that because of the limitations of laws protecting our intellectual property and the rapid  ongoing technological changes in both the computer hardware and software industries  we must rely principally upon software engineering and marketing skills to maintain and enhance our competitive market position 
while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products  we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists 
we believe  however  that software piracy is and can be expected to be a persistent problem 
production and suppliers production of our design solutions segment software products involves duplication of the software media and the printing of user manuals 
the purchase of media and the transfer of the software programs onto media for distribution to customers are performed by us and by licensed subcontractors 
media for our products include cd roms and diskettes  which are available from multiple sources 
user manuals for our products and packaging materials are produced to our specifications by outside sources 
production is generally performed in leased facilities operated by us 
some product assembly is also performed by independent third party contractors 
to date  we have not experienced any material difficulties or delays in the production of our software and documentation 
in addition  the discreet segment has historically relied on third party vendors for the supply of hardware components used in its systems 
many of the discreet s software products currently run on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics  inc sgi 
there are significant risks associated with this reliance on sgi and discreet may be impacted by unforeseen difficulties associated with adapting their products to future sgi products and the timing of the development and release of sgi products 
employees as of january   we had  full time equivalent employees 
none of our employees in the us are represented by a labor union  however  in certain foreign countries  our employees are represented by worker councils 
we have never experienced any work stoppages 
our continued growth and future success is highly dependent on the ability to attract  retain and motivate highly skilled employees 
item properties our executive offices and the principal offices for domestic marketing and sales and production are located in leased office space in northern california 
we also lease space in various locations throughout the us for local sales  development and technical support personnel 
our foreign subsidiaries lease office space for their operations including local sales  product development and technical support personnel 
during fiscal we closed several domestic and international offices in an effort to reduce operating expense levels 
we believe that our existing facilities and offices are adequate to meet our requirements for the foreseeable future 
item legal proceedings on december   spatial corp 
spatial filed suit in marin county superior court against autodesk and d cubed ltd 
d cubed  seeking a declaration that a autodesk had breached the ten year old development agreement between spatial and autodesk development agreement and b that autodesk and d cubed had misappropriated the trade secrets of spatial an injunction preventing autodesk from disclosing acis source code to d cubed and an injunction preventing autodesk from working with individuals who had previously worked on acis source code for spatial 
acis is a geometric solid modeler upon which autodesk shapemanager is derived 
autodesk shapemanager is incorporated into a number of autodesk products  including autodesk inventor series  autocad based products and ds max 
after a hearing on january   the superior court denied spatial s motion for a preliminary injunction  finding that spatial had failed to establish that it was likely to prevail on the merits at trial 
on august   spatial amended its complaint to seek the following additional remedies a declaration regarding the appropriate location of the acis source code and termination of development agreement  including our right to work with third party contractors on the acis source code and the perpetual right to incorporate and distribute acis with our products 
on october   spatial dismissed all of its claims for misappropriation of trade secrets against autodesk and d cubed 
on february   the court granted d cubed ltd 
s motion for summary judgment and denied our motion for summary adjudication of issues 
we filed a motion for reconsideration of the court s ruling to be argued in may the case is now scheduled for trial in june we believe that spatial s claims are without merit  and we are contesting them vigorously 
although the results of litigation are inherently uncertain  we believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have material effect on our consolidated statements of financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
however  if spatial were to prevail at trial on its request to terminate the perpetual license to acis  and we could not obtain a license on acceptable terms or license or develop a substitute technology  our business and operating results could be materially adversely affected 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million reserve related to this matter 
on october   digimation inc filed a demand for arbitration against autodesk with the american arbitration association alleging breach of contract and interference with prospective economic advantage and business relations 
the claims arise out of a november preferred publisher agreement the ppa entered into with our discreet division and relate to the marketing  publishing  development and support of software plug ins for our ds max application 
we have counter claimed against digimation for  among other things  digimation s failure to perform under the ppa 
we believe that the ultimate resolution of this matter will not have a material effect on our consolidated statements of financial condition  results of operations or cash flows 
generally  we are involved in various legal proceedings arising from the normal course of business activities 
in our opinion  resolution of these matters is not expected to have a material adverse impact on our consolidated results of operations  cash flows or our financial position 
however  depending on the amount and timing  an unfavorable resolution of a matter could materially affect our future results of operations  cash flows or financial position in a particular period

part ii item market for the registrant s common equity and related stockholder matters our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market under the symbol adsk 
the following table lists the high and low sales prices for each quarter in the last two fiscal years 
these share prices were adjusted for the two for one stock split that was effective for record holders on april high low fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter high low fiscal first quarter second quarter third quarter fourth quarter dividends adjusted for a stock split in april  we paid quarterly dividends of per share in fiscal and to autodesk stockholders 
we currently intend to continue paying regular cash dividends on a quarterly basis 
stockholders as of january  the number of common stockholders of record was because many of our shares of common stock are held by brokers or other institutions on behalf of stockholders  we are unable to estimate the total number of stockholders represented by the record holders 
item selected financial data the following selected consolidated financial data should be read in conjunction with our audited consolidated financial statements and related notes thereto and with management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  which are included elsewhere in this form k 
the financial data for the years ended january   and are derived from  and are qualified by reference to  the audited consolidated financial statements and are included in this form k 
the financial data for the years ended january  and are derived from audited consolidated financial statements which are not included in this form k 
fiscal year ended january  in thousands  except per share data for the fiscal year net revenues income from operations net income at year end total assets long term liabilities common stock data basic net income per share diluted net income per share dividends paid per share fiscal  and results were impacted by restructuring and other charges 
see note  restructuring and other  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
fiscal results were also impacted by a one time non cash gain of million related to the dissolution of an affiliate 
fiscal results were also impacted by a non recurring tax benefit of million 
see note  income taxes  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
fiscal   and results were also impacted by goodwill amortization charges of million  million  million and million  respectively 
see note  business and summary of significant accounting policies  in the notes to consolidated financial statements for further discussion 
item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the discussion in management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations contains trend analyses and other forward looking statements within the meaning of section a of the securities act of and section e of the securities exchange act of forward looking statements consist of  among other things  statements regarding net revenues  revenue mix  level of product returns  gross margins  costs and expenses  legal contingencies and restructuring activity  as well as statements involving trend analyses and statements including such words as we believe and similar expressions 
these forward looking statements are subject to business and economic risks 
as such  our actual results could differ materially from those set forth in the forward looking statements as a result of the factors set forth elsewhere herein  including risk factors which may impact future operating results 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets  liabilities  net revenues  costs and expenses and related disclosures 
we regularly evaluate our estimates and assumptions 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
we believe that of our significant accounting policies  which are described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements  the following policies involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity 
accordingly  these are the policies we believe are the most critical to aid in fully understanding and evaluating our financial condition and results of operations 
revenue recognition 
our accounting policies and practices are in compliance with statement of position  software revenue recognition  as amended  and staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition in financial statements 
we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed or determinable and collectibility is probable 
however  determining whether and when some of these criteria have been satisfied often involves assumptions and judgments that can have a significant impact on the timing and amount of revenue we report 
based on whether the sale is product or service related  we recognize revenue as follows 
product sales are recognized at the time of shipment as long as all other criteria for revenue recognition have been met 
subscription  customer support and hosted service revenues are recognized ratably over the contract periods 
customer consulting and training revenues are recognized as the services are performed 
allowance for bad debts 
we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
at january   we had a bad debt reserve of million 
estimated reserves are determined based upon historical loss patterns  the number of days that billings are past due and an evaluation of the potential risk of loss associated with specific problem accounts 
while we believe our existing reserve for doubtful accounts is adequate and proper  additional reserves may be required should the financial condition of our customers deteriorate or as unusual circumstances arise 
product return reserves 
with the exception of contracts with certain distributors  our sales contracts do not contain specific product return privileges 
however  we permit our distributors and resellers to return product in certain instances  generally when new product releases supercede older versions 
at january   we had a product returns reserve of million 
in the past three years  product returns as a percentage of applicable revenues have been in the range of to annually 
during fiscal year  product returns as a percentage of applicable revenue was 
the product return reserves are based on estimated channel inventory levels  the timing of new product introductions and other factors 
the greater the channel inventory level or the closer the proximity of a major new product release such as autocad  the more product returns we expect 
during fiscal year  we recorded a reserve for product returns of million  which reduced our gross sales 
while we believe our accounting practice for establishing and monitoring product returns reserves is adequate and proper  any adverse activity or unusual circumstances could result in an increase in reserve levels in the period in which such determinations are made 
realizability of long lived assets 
we review the realizability of our long lived assets and related intangible assets annually during the fourth fiscal quarter  or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying values of such assets may not be recoverable 
we consider some of the following factors important in deciding when to perform an impairment review significant under performance of a business or product line relative to budget  shifts in business strategies which impact the continued uses of the assets  significant negative industry or economic trends  and the results of past impairment reviews 
in assessing the recoverability of these long lived assets  we first determine their fair values  which are based on assumptions regarding the estimated future cash flows that could reasonably be generated by these assets 
when assessing long lived assets  we use undiscounted cash flow models 
impairment charges  if any  result in situations when the fair values of these assets are less than their carrying values 
in addition to our recoverability assessments  we routinely review the remaining estimated useful lives of our long lived assets 
any reduction in the useful life assumption will result in increased depreciation and amortization expense in the quarter when such determinations are made  as well as in subsequent quarters 
this situation occurred during the fourth quarter of fiscal resulting in additional amortization expense of million 
we will continue to evaluate the values of our long lived assets in accordance with applicable accounting rules 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
goodwill 
on february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
therefore  we no longer amortize goodwill 
we test goodwill for impairment annually in the fourth quarter or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate potential impairment 
as changes in business conditions and our assumptions occur  we may be required to record impairment charges 
deferred tax assets 
we currently have million of net deferred tax assets  mostly arising from net operating losses  tax credits  reserves and timing differences for purchased technologies and capitalized software offset by the establishment of us deferred tax liabilities on unremitted earnings from certain foreign subsidiaries 
we perform a quarterly assessment of the recoverability of these net deferred tax assets  which is principally dependent upon our achievement of future taxable income of approximately million in specific geographies 
our judgments regarding future profitability may change due to future market conditions and other factors 
these changes  if any  may require possible material adjustments to these net deferred tax assets  resulting in a reduction in net income in the period when such determinations are made 
restructuring expenses associated with office closures 
during the year ended january   we recorded restructuring charges of million of which million related to the closure of several domestic and international offices 
these office closure costs were based upon the projected rental payments through the remaining terms of the underlying operating leases  offset by projected subleasing income 
the projected subleasing income amounts were calculated by using information provided by third party real estate brokers and management judgments and were based on assumptions for each of the real estate markets where the leased offices were located 
should real estate markets worsen and we are not able to sublease the properties as expected  we will record additional expenses in the period when such determinations are made 
this situation occurred during fiscal and and we therefore recorded additional charges as a result of the inability to sublease abandoned offices 
if the real estate markets subsequently improve  and we are able to sublease the properties earlier or at more favorable rates than projected  we will reverse some of the underlying restructuring accruals  which will result in increased net income in the period when such determinations are made 
legal contingencies 
as described in item legal proceedings and note  commitments and contingencies  in the notes to the consolidated financial statements  we are periodically involved in various legal claims and proceedings 
we routinely review the status of each significant matter and assess our potential financial exposure 
if the potential loss from any matter is considered probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated  we record a liability for the estimated loss 
during the fourth quarter of fiscal we recorded a million reserve related to the spatial matter 
because of inherent uncertainties related to these legal matters  we base our loss reserves on the best information available at the time 
as additional information becomes available  we reassess our potential liability and may revise our estimates 
such revisions could have a material impact on future quarterly results of operations 
stock option accounting 
we do not record compensation expense when stock option grants are awarded to employees at exercise prices equal to the fair market value of autodesk common stock on the date of grant 
had we recorded compensation expense  our net income would have been substantially less 
the impact of expensing employee stock awards is further described in note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
recently issued accounting standards during november  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness to others  an interpretation of fasb statements no 
 and and a rescission of fasb interpretation no 
fin 
fin elaborates on the existing disclosure requirements for a guarantor in its interim and annual financial statements about its obligations under guarantees issued 
it also clarifies that at the time a guarantee is issued  the guarantor must recognize an initial liability for the fair value of the obligations it assumes under the guarantee and must disclose that information in its financial statements 
the initial recognition and measurement provisions apply on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   and the disclosure requirements apply to guarantees outstanding as of december  we adopted the provisions of fin effective january  some of the software licenses we grant contain provisions that indemnify licensees of our software from damages and costs resulting from claims alleging that our software infringes the intellectual property rights of a third party 
we have historically received only a limited number of requests for indemnification under these provisions and have not been required to make material payments pursuant to these provisions 
accordingly  we have not recorded a liability related to these indemnification provisions 
overview of fiscal results of operations in thousands for the year ended january  as a of net revenues for the year ended january  as a of net revenues net revenues cost of revenues operating expenses amortization of goodwill and purchased intangibles restructuring and other income from operations our fiscal net revenues were down percent from the prior fiscal year 
this revenue decline resulted in an operating margin of percent of fiscal net revenues as compared to percent in fiscal and percent in fiscal the decline in revenue this year was due to two primary factors 
first  we faced a difficult customer purchasing environment across the industries we serve  particularly manufacturing  commercial construction  and media and entertainment 
our customers both delayed purchases and purchased in smaller quantities than we would normally expect 
we believe our customers were impacted by economic pressures in their own businesses 
second  our revenues were impacted by a relatively slow year for new product releases across many of our divisions  leading to weakness in sales of both new commercial seats as well as sales of upgrades 
in previous years  when new product cycles occurred such as for autocad  our flagship product  revenues from customers upgrading and new commercial seat licenses resulted in significant revenue growth between years 
during fiscal  upgrade revenues for our software products decreased to million from million in the previous year  which is a decline much greater than the decrease in total net revenues between years 
our most significant new product releases occurred either late in fiscal or are scheduled for release early in fiscal during fiscal  we introduced in the us the autodesk subscription program  which is an option for our customers who own the most recent version of the underlying product 
through this program  which is available for a majority of our design solutions products as well as discreet s ds max  we offer customers strong value while allowing us to reduce our dependence on revenues from customers upgrading when new product cycles occur 
while the customer subscription program met our internal growth goals during fiscal  subscription revenues were not yet large enough to offset the relatively weak upgrade sales 
this was due to the ratable revenue recognition model that we use for subscription bookings and the lack of availability of the subscription program in several regions outside of the us each of our sales geographies suffered due to the two factors described above 
we generate a significant amount of revenue in several countries  including the us  japan  germany  united kingdom  italy  france  canada and china 
japan was particularly weak in our asia pacific region  due largely to continued weakness in the japanese economy 
our operating margins are very sensitive to reductions in sales revenues  given the relatively fixed nature of most of our operating expenses  which consist primarily of employee related expenditures  facilities costs and depreciation and amortization expense 
during fiscal we invested in several new internal product initiatives which we believe will contribute to future operating margin growth 
these investments were in areas such as product lifecycle management  building lifecycle management  location based services  online collaborative services and desktop video 
we have chosen to continue each of these important investments during our current sales slowdown because we believe each of them is very promising  and we believe our ability to fund such investments during an economic slowdown is a strong competitive advantage 
by continuing to fund these initiatives  we have explicitly chosen not to reduce our costs to a level that would achieve historical operating margin levels 
during fiscal  we acquired three new businesses  revit technology corporation  caice software corporation and trueinnovations  inc these investments either provide us with future opportunities in markets where we have a limited presence or supplement existing technology 
for a more detailed discussion  see note  business combinations  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
during fiscal  we continued our cost reduction efforts  primarily in areas such as employee and facilities related costs 
the objective of this restructuring activity and other cost saving initiatives  such as no incentive bonus payouts and mandatory time off for our employees  was to provide a level of profitability and provide funding during fiscal for the investments described above 
we believe that our recent activities will result in an annual operating expense run rate between million to million  exclusive of any additional restructuring or unusual charges 
at this operating expense level  we expect to continue to remain profitable at recent levels of revenue and be able to fund investments we believe will increase future revenues and operating margins 
throughout fiscal  we maintained a financially strong balance sheet and we generated million of cash from our operating activities 
we finished the year with million in cash and marketable securities and a significantly higher deferred revenue balance as compared to the previous year 
over percent of the deferred revenues balance at january  consisted of customer subscription contracts  which as described previously will be recognized as revenue ratably over the life of the contracts 
results of operations net revenues increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal percent fiscal percent fiscal in millions net revenues by geographic area americas europe asia pacific net revenues by operating segment design solutions discreet net design solutions revenues manufacturing solutions division infrastructure solutions division building solutions division platform technology division and other our net revenues for fiscal were million as compared to million in fiscal net revenues decreased in all three geographic areas 
as previously described  the overall decrease was primarily due to a difficult selling environment across the industries we serve and by a slow year for new product releases 
with most of our competitors suffering similar slowdowns  we do not believe we have lost market share to competitors 
the timing of our product cycles typically impact the amount of sales in periods when new releases occur 
should the difficult economic environment continue  our net revenues in fiscal will be adversely affected 
net revenues in the americas decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to lower sales of design solutions products as a result of poor economic conditions in the industries that constitute our customer base 
net revenues in europe decreased to million in fiscal from million in due to the impact of lower customer spending across product lines 
net revenues in asia pacific decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to weakness in the japanese economy 
net revenues for the discreet segment were million in fiscal as compared to million in fiscal as advanced system sales were significantly affected by the timing of new product releases and delays in customer purchases as those customers were severely impacted by the economic slow down in the media  advertising and entertainment sectors 
discreet advanced system sales are dependent upon capital spending from post production companies 
demand from post production companies is largely dependent upon television advertising spending 
television advertising spending has been weak over the past two years 
in the design solutions segment  net revenues from sales of combined autocad and autocad lt products decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal due primarily to a weak spending environment across the industries we serve  and reduced revenues in anticipation of new product releases 
although we have been reducing our dependence on key product lines  sales of autocad  autocad upgrades and autocad lt continue to be a significant portion of our net revenues 
such sales  which are reflected in the net revenues for the platform technology division and other  accounted for percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal and percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal should sales of autocad  autocad upgrades and autocad lt products decrease as a result of weakened demand due to poor economic conditions in the industries that constitute our customer base  our results of operations will be adversely affected 
the weaker value of the us dollar  relative to international currencies  had a positive impact on net revenues in fiscal had exchange rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal  translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been million lower 
changes in the value of the us dollar may have a significant impact on net revenues in fiscal international sales accounted for approximately percent of our net revenues in fiscal as compared to percent in the prior fiscal year 
we believe that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total revenues 
many world economies are in the midst of current economic slowdowns 
economic weakness in any of the countries which contribute a significant portion of our net revenues would have a material adverse effect on our business 
our net revenues for fiscal were million as compared to million in fiscal increased net revenues in asia pacific and the americas were partially offset by lower sales in europe 
net revenues for the discreet segment were million in fiscal as compared to million in the prior fiscal year as advanced system sales were significantly affected by a slowdown in the media  advertising and entertainment sectors upon which product sales depend 
net revenues for the design solutions segment were million in fiscal as compared to million in the prior fiscal year 
the overall increase in segment revenues was attributable to a stronger portfolio of product offerings  such as autodesk inventor  autodesk architectural desktop  autodesk map  autodesk land desktop and autocad  and increased customer demand for greater productivity tools 
sales of autocad  autocad upgrades and autocad lt accounted for percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal and percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal the stronger value of the us dollar  relative to international currencies  had a negative impact on net revenues in fiscal had exchange rates from the prior year been in effect in fiscal  translated international revenue billed in local currencies would have been million higher 
international sales accounted for approximately percent of our net revenues in fiscal as compared to percent in the prior fiscal year 
we believe that international sales will continue to be a significant portion of total revenues 
cost of revenues fiscal increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal percent fiscal percent in millions cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues cost of revenues includes direct material and overhead charges  royalties  amortization of purchased technology and capitalized software and the labor cost of processing orders and fulfilling service contracts 
direct material and overhead charges include the cost of hardware sold mainly workstations manufactured by sgi for the discreet segment  costs associated with transferring our software to electronic media  printing of user manuals and packaging materials  and shipping and handling costs 
the decrease of million between fiscal years and was due primarily to the mix of product sales and overall lower revenue between years 
the cost of revenues in fiscal year was the same as a percentage of net revenues and similar in absolute dollars to cost of revenues in fiscal year in the future  cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues is likely to continue to be impacted by the mix of product sales  increased consulting and hosted service costs  software amortization costs  royalty rates for licensed technology embedded in our products and the geographic distribution of sales 
however  we expect future cost of revenues as a percentage of net revenues to remain within our historical range of to percent 
marketing and sales expenses fiscal increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal percent percent in millions marketing and sales as a percentage of net revenues marketing and sales expenses include salaries  dealer and sales commissions  and travel and facility costs for our marketing  sales  dealer training and support personnel 
these expenses also include programs aimed at increasing revenues  such as advertising  trade shows and expositions  as well as various sales and promotional programs designed for specific sales channels and end users 
the decrease of million between fiscal years and was due primarily to lower dealer and sales commissions of million due to lower revenue  lower rent and occupancy charges of million  which resulted from cost saving initiatives  and lower professional services of million 
the increase of million between fiscal years and was primarily due to higher employee related expenses resulting from an increasing focus on direct sales to major accounts 
we expect to continue to invest in marketing and sales of our products  to develop market opportunities and to promote our competitive position 
accordingly  we expect marketing and sales expenses to continue to be significant  both in absolute dollars and as a percentage of net revenues 
research and development expenses fiscal increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal percent percent in millions research and development as a percentage of net revenues research and development expenses consist primarily of salaries and benefits for software engineers  contract development fees and depreciation of computer equipment used in software development 
the increase of million between fiscal years and was primarily due to incremental costs resulting from our recent acquisitions of revit in april and caice in september and our continued funding of location based services and product lifecycle management initiatives 
research and development expenses for fiscal year were offset by million of capitalized development costs mostly associated with autocad  which was released in march research and development expenses in fiscal year were the same as a percentage of net revenues and similar in absolute dollars to research and development expenses in fiscal year we expect that research and development spending will continue to be significant in fiscal as we continue to invest in product development 
general and administrative expenses fiscal increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal percent percent in millions general and administrative as a percentage of net revenues general and administrative expenses include our information systems  finance  human resources  legal and other administrative operations 
we generally do not allocate these costs to the business divisions they support  so such expenses impact general and administrative rather than cost of revenues  research and development or marketing and sales expenses 
the decrease of million between fiscal years and was due primarily to lower rent and occupancy charges of million  which resulted from cost saving initiatives  and a million decrease in bad debt expense  as a result of improved collection of trade receivables 
these decreases were primarily offset by million of additional legal settlement reserves  of which million was specifically set aside for the spatial legal proceedings matter 
general and administrative expenses in fiscal year were the same as a percentage and similar in absolute dollars to general and administrative expenses in fiscal year we currently expect that in the coming year general and administrative expenses  as a percentage of net revenues  will remain generally consistent with the level experienced in fiscal other intangible assets 
amortization of purchased intangibles is provided on a straight line basis over the respective useful lives of the assets  which range from three to seven years 
amortization expense was million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal goodwill amortization expense 
on february   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
goodwill and other intangible assets 
therefore  autodesk no longer amortizes goodwill but rather tests it for impairment annually in the fourth quarter 
there was no impairment of goodwill during the year ended january  goodwill amortization expense was million in fiscal and million in fiscal restructuring and other charges fiscal increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal increase decrease compared to prior fiscal year fiscal percent percent in millions restructuring and other during fiscal autodesk recognized million of restructuring and other charges resulting solely from restructuring activities 
of the million  million related to additional costs associated with the fiscal restructuring plan and million related to a new fiscal restructuring plan partially offset by a credit of million resulting from accrual reversals 
of the million related to the fiscal plan  million related to the further consolidation of certain european offices and the remaining million resulted from increases to estimated accrued liabilities related to vacated facilities 
since these offices were closed in fiscal  there has been a significant downturn in the real estate market  particularly in northern california where some of the offices are located 
as such  we were unable to either buyout the remaining lease obligations at favorable amounts or sub lease the space at amounts originally estimated during fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal the board of directors approved a new restructuring plan that resulted in the termination of employees and the closure of several additional international and domestic offices 
as a result of the restructuring plan approved in the third quarter of  we expect to realize immediate pretax savings of million per quarter and increased cash flows of million per quarter 
these savings are expected to last for the next several quarters and the pretax savings will be reflected in each on going cost and expense line item in the consolidated statements of income 
both the pretax and cash flow savings are being used to fund the new business opportunities previously described 
during the year ended january   we recognized million of expenses as part of this restructuring effort  of which million related to employee termination costs and million related to office closures 
employee termination costs consisted of wage continuation  advance notice pay  medical benefits  and outplacement costs for employees in the us and employees outside the us office closure costs included losses on operating leases and the write off of leasehold improvements and equipment 
during fiscal year we also reversed million and million of facility related accruals related to restructuring reserves established in fiscal and fiscal  respectively 
the facility related accruals were settled for less than originally estimated 
during fiscal we recognized million of restructuring and other charges 
these charges resulted from restructuring activities million  in process research and development expenses related to the acquisition of media million  the wind down costs associated with the dissolution of redspark  a development stage company million  and a goodwill write off of million 
the write off of goodwill primarily related to an acquired infrastructure solutions division business and resulted from a strategic decision to abandon the underlying product line 
the restructuring costs  which were part of a formal exit plan approved by our board of directors during the second quarter of fiscal  were in connection with our effort to reduce operating expense levels 
during that same quarter  we reduced our revenue estimates for the remainder of fiscal as a result of the restructuring we realized immediate pretax savings of million per quarter and increased cash flows of million per quarter in addition to the savings expected to be realized from the restructuring plan 
these savings are expected to last for the next several quarters and the pretax savings have been reflected in each on going cost and expense line item in the consolidated statements of income 
both the pretax and cash flow savings were re invested in other parts of the business 
during fiscal we reversed million of accruals  million of which related to a restructuring reserve established in fiscal the accruals were settled for less than originally estimated 
for additional information regarding the restructuring and other charges recorded over the past three fiscal years  see note  restructuring and other  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
interest and other income the following table sets forth the components of interest and other income  net in thousands interest and investment income gains losses on foreign currency transactions minority interest in net loss of redspark write downs of investments in privately held businesses realized gains losses on investments other investment income fluctuates based on average cash and marketable securities balances  average maturities and interest rates 
the decrease in interest and other income between fiscal  and was primarily due to a trend of declining interest rates on the investment of cash and marketable securities balances combined with lower cash and marketable securities balances 
gain on disposal of affiliate 
during the third quarter of fiscal we recognized a one time non cash gain of million related to the dissolution of redspark 
because we owned greater than percent of the voting stock  we had been consolidating redspark s operating losses since redspark was formed in april redspark s expenses  which were primarily research and development related  were included within the operating expense categories of our statement of income 
the gain  which resulted from the reversal of the minority interest liability balance  represents the reversal of cumulative losses recognized in excess of the million we originally invested 
provision for income taxes 
absent the impact of the non recurring tax benefit resulting from the internal revenue service irs audit resolution for fiscal  our effective income tax rate was percent in fiscal  percent in fiscal absent the impact of the gain on disposal of affiliate and percent in fiscal the non recurring net tax benefit of million resulted from the resolution of our irs audit for the fiscal years ended and the establishment of us deferred income taxes on previously permanently reinvested foreign earnings 
the effective tax rate for fiscal is less than the federal statutory rate of percent due to the benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate  research credits and tax exempt interest  partially offset by additional taxes provided on prior year foreign earnings 
additional taxes on prior year foreign earnings relate to a foreign tax audit and to intercompany transfer pricing adjustments 
the fiscal tax rate was lower than the fiscal and tax rates due to a relatively higher impact of these permanent items 
our future effective tax rate may be impacted by the amount of benefits associated with our foreign earnings  which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate  research credits and tax exempt interest 
we currently believe that our fiscal effective tax rate will be less than percent primarily due to a relatively higher impact of benefits associated with our foreign earnings which are taxed at rates different from the federal statutory rate 
at january  we had net deferred tax assets of million 
realization of these assets is dependent on our ability to generate approximately million of future taxable income in appropriate tax jurisdictions 
we believe that sufficient income will be earned in the future to realize these assets 
equity in net loss of affiliate 
in august we acquired the remaining percent interest in buzzsaw that we did not own 
consequently  from the date of the acquisition  buzzsaw s on going revenues and costs and expenses have been included in each of the respective line items in our consolidated statements of income 
we recognized equity in net losses of million in fiscal and million in fiscal  representing our proportionate share of buzzsaw s losses during those periods 
in april we invested million in buzzsaw and maintained a percent interest 
loss recognition was suspended during the first quarter of  after we fully expensed all previous investments in buzzsaw 
business combinations over the past three years  we acquired new technology or supplemented our technology by purchasing businesses focused in specific markets or industries 
during this time period  we acquired the following businesses date company and purchase consideration details december trueinnovations  inc million in cash trueinnovations  inc developed file and data management software that is very tightly integrated into our autodesk inventor series environment 
the trueinnovations  inc acquisition has been integrated with our manufacturing solutions division 
september caice software corporation million in cash this acquisition allows us to expand our presence in the transportation software market as well as enhance our core civil design industry business 
the caice acquisition has been integrated with our infrastructure solutions division 
april revit technology corporation million  of which million was in cash this acquisition provides us with parametric building information modeling technology and provides us with potential next generation technology 
the revit acquisition has been integrated with our building solutions division 
october software division of media million in cash this acquisition provides us with streaming media technology  cleaner brand encoding software  production and editing tools 
this business has been integrated with our discreet segment 
august buzzsaw  inc million of which million was in cash we acquired the remaining percent of stock in buzzsaw that we did not own 
this acquisition provides us with leading online project collaboration applications to improve efficiencies and reduce costs for the building industry 
buzzsaw s results are reported in the platform technology division and other 
these acquisitions were all accounted for under the purchase method of accounting pursuant to statement of financial accounting standards no 
 business combinations 
of these acquisitions  million of the media purchase price was allocated to in process research and development ipr d and was expensed immediately since the technology had not yet reached technological feasibility and no alternative future uses could be identified 
as of the acquisition date  the ipr d substantially consisted of the hitman product  an enterprise encoding system that automates the encoding process and allows for the encoding of multiple jobs at the same time 
the hitman product was percent complete at the time  with million of estimated remaining costs to reach technological feasibility 
we recently released this product with actual costs to complete that approximated the initial million estimate 
in valuing the developed and in process technologies  we used a discounted cash flow analysis based on projected net revenues  cost of revenues  operating expenses and income taxes resulting from such technologies over a year period 
the projected financial results  which were discounted using a percent rate for the developed technology and a percent rate for the ipr d  were based on expectations of media on a stand alone basis 
the revenue projections for developed technologies  which considered the release dates of new products  assumed a gradual decline 
we based the revenue projections for the ipr d on expected trends in technology and the timing of new product introductions 
for a more detailed discussion of the allocation of the total purchase considerations for each of the acquired businesses described above  which includes among other things liabilities assumed  see note  business combinations  in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources at january  our principal sources of liquidity were cash and marketable securities totaling million and accounts receivable of million 
additionally  we currently have a million line of credit with a financial institution 
other than operating leases  described below we do not engage in off balance sheet financing arrangements or any special purpose entities 
during fiscal we generated million of cash from operating activities as compared to million in fiscal cash flows from operating activities  together with the proceeds from stock issuances resulting from our employee stock plans  continue to be our principal means of generating cash 
cash flows from operating activities have historically resulted from sales of our software products  changes in working capital accounts and add backs of non cash expense items such as depreciation and amortization 
during fiscal the cash generated  together with cash and securities available at the start of the year  was used to fund the repurchase of million shares of our common stock for million  the acquisition of revit for million  the acquisition of two other businesses for million  capital and other expenditures of million and dividend payments totaling million 
between november and march the board of directors approved plans to repurchase up to million shares of our common stock 
of these million shares  million have been repurchased and retired as of january  the purpose of the stock repurchase program is  among other things  to help offset the dilution to earnings per share caused by the issuance of stock under our employee stock plans 
as of february we have a us line of credit permitting short term  unsecured borrowings of up to million  which may be used from time to time for working capital or other business needs 
this credit facility contains restrictive covenants that  among other provisions require autodesk to maintain certain financial ratios and expires in february we generally do not enter into binding purchase commitments 
principal commitments at january   consisted of obligations under operating leases for facilities and some computer equipment 
at january  the future minimum lease payments under these lease commitments were as follows in millions 
of these amounts million has been included in our restructuring accruals at january  thereafter we believe our existing cash  cash equivalents  marketable securities  available line of credit and cash generated from operations will be sufficient to satisfy our currently anticipated short term and long term cash requirements 
long term cash requirements  other than normal operating expenses  are anticipated for the development of new software products and incremental product offerings resulting from the enhancement of existing products  financing anticipated growth  dividend payments  the share repurchase program  the acquisition of businesses  software products  or technologies complementary to our business  and capital expenditures 
in february  we acquired the assets of linius technologies  inc for million in cash and in march  we acquired certain assets of via development corporation for approximately million in cash 
capital expenditures for fiscal are currently anticipated to approximate what was incurred during fiscal  but could be reduced if our revenues are less than anticipated 
our international operations are subject to currency fluctuations 
to minimize the impact of these fluctuations  we use foreign currency option contracts to hedge our exposure on anticipated transactions and forward contracts to hedge our exposure on firm commitments  primarily certain payables and receivables denominated in foreign currencies 
our foreign currency instruments by policy have maturities of less than three months and settle before the end of each quarterly period 
the principal currencies hedged during fiscal were the euro  swiss franc  british pound  canadian dollar and japanese yen 
we monitor our foreign exchange exposures to ensure the overall effectiveness of our foreign currency hedge positions 
stock compensation we maintain three active stock option plans for the purpose of granting stock options to employees and members of autodesk s board of directors the stock plan available to employees but not directors  the nonstatutory stock option plan available only to non executive employees and the directors option plan available only to outside directors 
additionally  there are five expired plans with options outstanding 
our stock option program is a broad based  long term retention program 
essentially all of our employees participate 
approximately percent of the options we granted during fiscal were awarded to employees other than our ceo and four most highly compensated executive officers 
options granted under the above mentioned plans vest over periods ranging from one to five years and expire within ten years 
the exercise price of the stock options is equal to the fair market value of the stock on the grant date 
with the exception of grants to our outside directors  all stock option grants to executive officers and guidelines for grants to other employees are made by the compensation committee of the board of directors 
all members of the compensation committee are independent directors  as defined in the application rules for issuers traded on the nasdaq stock market 
see the report of the compensation committee on executive compensation appearing in autodesk s proxy statement dated may   for further information concerning the policies and procedures of autodesk and the compensation committee regarding the use of stock options 
grants to our outside directors are pre determined by the terms of the directors option plan 
additional information regarding stock compensation is incorporated by reference to the section of the proxy statement entitled employee and director stock options 
risk factors which may impact future operating results we operate in a rapidly changing environment that involves a number of risks  many of which are beyond our control 
the following discussion highlights some of these risks and the possible impact of these factors on future results of operations 
if any of the following risks actually occur  our business  financial condition or results of operations may be adversely impacted  causing the trading price of our common stock to decline 
general economic conditions may continue to reduce our net revenues and harm our business 
as our business has grown  we have become increasingly subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic and political conditions  including the conflict in the persian gulf and the potential economic impact from current concerns about severe acute respiratory syndrome sars 
because of the continued slowdown in the us and other countries economies  many customers are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
if this slowdown continues  particularly in industries or countries that contribute a significant portion of our net revenues  it will likely continue to result in reductions in sales of our products  longer sales cycles  slower adoption of new technologies and increased price competition 
in addition  weakness in the end user market could continue to negatively affect the cash flow of our distributors and resellers who could  in turn  delay paying their obligations to us  which would increase our credit risk exposure 
any of these events would likely harm our business  results of operations and financial condition 
because we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from a limited number of products  if these products are not successful  our net revenues will be adversely affected 
we derive a substantial portion of our net revenues from sales of autocad software  including products based on autocad that serve specific vertical markets  upgrades to those products and products that are interoperable with autocad 
as such  any factor adversely affecting sales of these products  including product life cycle  market acceptance  product performance and reliability  reputation  price competition and the availability of third party applications  would likely harm our operating results 
in the discreet business  our customers buying patterns are heavily influenced by advertising and entertainment industry cycles  which has resulted in and may continue to have a negative impact on our operating results 
in addition  discreet s systems products rely on workstations manufactured by silicon graphics and failure of silicon graphics to deliver products in a timely manner would likely result in an adverse effect upon our financial results for a given period 
our operating results fluctuate within each quarter and from quarter to quarter making our future revenues and operating results difficult to predict 
our quarterly operating results have fluctuated in the past and are likely to do so in the future 
these fluctuations could cause our stock price to change significantly or experience declines 
some of the factors that could cause our operating results to fluctuate include the timing of the introduction of new products by us or our competitors  changes in marketing or operating expenses  changes in product pricing or product mix  platform changes  delays in product releases  distribution channel management  changes in sales compensation practices  the timing of large systems sales and general economic or political conditions  particularly in countries where we derive a significant portion of our net revenues 
we have also experienced fluctuations in operating results in interim periods in certain geographic regions due to seasonality or regional economic conditions 
in particular  our operating results in europe during the third quarter are usually impacted by a slow summer period  and the asia pacific operations typically experience seasonal slowing in the third and fourth quarters 
operating expenses may also increase in periods when major product releases occur 
additionally  our operating expenses are based in part on our expectations for future revenues and are relatively fixed in the short term 
accordingly  any revenue shortfall below expectations could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on our profitability 
further  gross margins may be adversely affected if our sales of autocad lt  upgrades and systems products  which historically have had lower margins  grow at a faster rate than sales of our higher margin products 
existing and increased competition may reduce our net revenues and profits 
the software industry has limited barriers to entry  and the availability of desktop computers with continually expanding performance at progressively lower prices contributes to the ease of market entry 
the markets in which we compete are fairly mature and characterized by vigorous competition  both by entry of competitors with innovative technologies and by consolidation of companies with complementary products and technologies 
in addition  some of our competitors have greater financial  technical  sales and marketing and other resources 
furthermore  a reduction in the number and availability of comparable third party applications may adversely affect the sale of our products 
because of these and other factors  competitive conditions in the industry are likely to intensify in the future 
increased competition could result in continued price reductions  reduced net revenues and profit margins and loss of market share  any of which would likely harm our business 
we believe that our future results depend largely upon our ability to offer products that compete favorably with respect to reliability  performance  ease of use  range of useful features  continuing product enhancements  reputation and price 
we rely on third party technologies and if we are unable to use or integrate these technologies  our product and service development may be delayed 
we rely on certain software that we license from third parties  including software that is integrated with internally developed software and used in our products to perform key functions 
an example of this type of software is the acis geometric solid modeler we license from spatial 
these third party software licenses may not continue to be available on commercially reasonable terms  and the software may not be appropriately supported  maintained or enhanced by the licensors 
the loss of licenses to  or inability to support  maintain and enhance any such software could result in increased costs  or in delays or reductions in product shipments until equivalent software could be developed  identified  licensed and integrated  which would likely harm our business 
in addition  for certain of our products and services  we rely on third party hardware and services 
financial difficulties or even failure of these third parties may impact our ability to deliver such on line collaboration applications and  as a result  may adversely impact our business 
disruptions with licensing relationships  independent developers and third party developers could adversely impact our business 
independent firms and contractors perform some of our product development activities  while other technologies are licensed from third parties 
licenses may restrict use of such technology in ways that negatively affect our business 
we generally either own or license the software developed by third parties 
because talented development personnel are in high demand  independent developers  including those who currently develop products for us  may not be able or willing to provide development support to us in the future 
similarly  we may not be able to obtain and renew license agreements on favorable terms  if at all  and any failure to do so could harm our business 
our business strategy has historically depended in part on our relationships with third party developers  who provide products that expand the functionality of our design software 
some developers may elect to support other products or may experience disruption in product development and delivery cycles or financial pressure during periods of economic downturn 
in particular markets  this disruption would likely negatively impact these third party developers and end users  which could harm our business 
net revenues or earnings shortfalls or the volatility of the market generally may cause the market price of our stock to decline  which could harm our business 
the market price for our common stock has experienced significant fluctuations and may continue to fluctuate significantly 
the market price for our common stock may be affected by a number of factors  including the following net revenues or earnings shortfalls and changes in estimates or recommendations by securities analysts  the announcement of new products or product enhancements by us or our competitors  quarterly variations in our or our competitors results of operations  developments in our industry  and general market conditions and other factors  including factors unrelated to our operating performance or the operating performance of our competitors 
in addition  stock prices for many companies in the technology sector have experienced wide fluctuations that have often been unrelated to the operating performance of such companies 
historically  after extended periods of volatility in the market price of a company s securities  a company becomes more susceptible to securities class action litigation 
this type of litigation is often expensive and diverts management s attention and resources 
our efforts to develop and introduce new products and service offerings expose us to risks such as limited customer acceptance  costs related to product defects and large expenditures that may not result in additional net revenues 
rapid technological change as well as changes in customer requirements and preferences characterize the software industry 
we are devoting significant resources to the development of technologies and service offerings to address demands in the marketplace for increased connectivity and use of digital data created by computer aided design software 
as a result  we are transitioning to new business models  requiring a considerable investment of technical and financial resources 
such investments may not result in sufficient revenue generation to justify their costs  or competitors may introduce new products and services that will achieve acceptance among our current customers  adversely affecting our competitive position 
additionally  the software products we offer are complex  and despite extensive testing and quality control  may contain errors or defects 
these defects or errors could result in corrective releases to our software products  damage to our reputation  loss of revenues  an increase in product returns or lack of market acceptance of our products  any of which would likely harm our business 
our business could suffer as a result of risks associated with strategic acquisitions and investments 
we periodically acquire or invest in businesses  software products and technologies that are complementary to our business through strategic alliances  equity investments and the like 
for example  in april we acquired revit and in september we acquired caice 
the risks associated with such acquisitions or investments include  among others  the difficulty of assimilating the operations and personnel of the companies  the failure to realize anticipated synergies and the diversion of management s time and attention 
in addition  such investments and acquisitions may involve significant transaction related costs 
we may not be successful in overcoming such risks  and such investments and acquisitions may negatively impact our business 
in addition  such investments and acquisitions have in the past and may in the future contribute to potential fluctuations in quarterly results of operations 
the fluctuations could arise from merger related costs and charges associated with eliminating redundant expenses or write offs of impaired assets recorded in connection with acquisitions 
these costs or charges could negatively impact results of operations for a given period or cause lack of a consistent increase quarter to quarter in our operating results 
our international operations expose us to significant regulatory  intellectual property  collections  exchange fluctuations and other risks  which could adversely impact our future net revenues 
we anticipate that international operations will continue to account for a significant portion of our consolidated net revenues 
risks inherent in our international operations include the following unexpected changes in regulatory practices and tariffs  difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  longer collection cycles for accounts receivable  potential changes in tax laws and laws regarding the management of data  greater difficulty in protecting intellectual property and the impact of fluctuating exchange rates between the us dollar and foreign currencies in markets where we do business 
our international results may also continue to be impacted by general economic and political conditions in these foreign markets or in specific large foreign markets 
in particular  war in the persian gulf or the potential economic impact from concerns about sars could disrupt trade and market relationships in a way that could harm our business 
these and other factors may adversely impact our future international operations and consequently our business as a whole 
our risk management strategy uses derivative financial instruments in the form of foreign currency forward and option contracts for the purpose of hedging foreign currency market exposures  which exist as a part of our ongoing business operations 
if we do not maintain our relationship with the members of our distribution channel  our ability to generate net revenues will be adversely affected 
we sell our software products both directly to customers and through a network of distributors and resellers 
our ability to effectively distribute our products depends in part upon the financial and business condition of our reseller network 
computer software dealers and distributors are typically not highly capitalized and have previously experienced difficulties during times of economic contraction  such as current worldwide economic conditions  and may do so in the future 
in addition  the changing distribution models resulting from the internet  from increased focus on direct sales to major accounts or from two tiered distribution may impact our reseller network in the future 
no single customer  distributor or reseller accounted for more than percent of our consolidated net revenues in fiscal  or however  we rely significantly upon major distributors and resellers in both the us and international regions and the loss of or a significant reduction in business or failure to achieve anticipated levels of sell through with any one of our major international distributors or large resellers could harm our business 
in particular  if one or more of such resellers should be unable to meet their obligations with respect to accounts payable to us  we could be forced to write off such accounts  which could have a material adverse effect on our results of operations in a given period 
product returns could exceed our estimates and harm our net revenues 
with the exception of contracts with some distributors  our sales contracts do not contain specific product return privileges 
however  we permit our distributors and resellers to return products in certain instances 
for example  we generally allow our distributors and resellers to return older versions of products which have been superceded by new product releases 
we anticipate that product returns will continue to be impacted by product update cycles  new product releases such as autocad and software quality 
we establish reserves for stock balancing and product rotation 
these reserves are based on historical experience  estimated channel inventory levels and the timing of new product introductions and other factors 
while we maintain strict measures to monitor these reserves  actual product returns may differ from our reserve estimates  and such differences could harm our business 
if we are not able to adequately protect our proprietary rights  our business could be harmed 
we rely on a combination of patents  copyright and trademark laws  trade secrets  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our proprietary rights 
despite such efforts to protect our proprietary rights  unauthorized parties from time to time have copied aspects of our software products or have obtained and used information that we regard as proprietary 
policing unauthorized use of our software products is time consuming and costly 
while we have recovered some revenues resulting from the unauthorized use of our software products  we are unable to measure the extent to which piracy of our software products exists  and software piracy can be expected to be a persistent problem 
furthermore  our means of protecting our proprietary rights may not be adequate  and our competitors may independently develop similar technology 
we may face intellectual property infringement claims that could be costly to defend and result in our loss of significant rights 
we expect that software product developers will be increasingly subject to infringement claims as the number of products and competitors in our industry segments grows and as the functionality of products in different industry segments overlaps 
infringement  invalidity claims or misappropriation claims may be asserted against us  and any such assertions could harm our business 
litigation often becomes more likely in times of economic downturn 
any such claims  whether with or without merit  could be time consuming to defend  result in costly litigation and diversion of resources  cause product shipment delays  or require us to enter into royalty or licensing agreements 
in addition  such royalty or license agreements  if required  may not be available on acceptable terms  if at all  which would likely harm our business 
the loss of key personnel or the inability to attract and retain additional personnel could harm our business 
our continued growth and success depends significantly on the continued service of highly skilled employees and independent developers 
our ability to attract and retain key personnel is dependent on a number of factors  including our continued ability to grant stock incentive awards 
changes in the accounting rules for stock options  which are granted to most of our employees and which have been a significant factor in attracting and retaining key technical and management experts  could have a material adverse effect on our business 
the loss of key personnel or inability to recruit new employees or independent developers would negatively impact our business 
in addition  we may experience increased compensation costs to attract and retain skilled personnel 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk foreign currency exchange risk our earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
our risk management strategy utilizes foreign currency forward and option contracts to manage our foreign currency exposures that exist as part of our ongoing business operations 
contracts are primarily denominated in euro  swiss francs  canadian dollars  british pounds and japanese yen 
we do not enter into any foreign exchange derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our hedging portfolio as of january  this analysis indicated that a hypothetical percent appreciation of the us dollar from its value at january  would increase the fair value of our forward exchange option contracts by million 
conversely  a hypothetical percent depreciation of the dollar from its value at january  would decrease the fair value of our forward exchange option contracts by million 
we do not anticipate any material adverse impact to our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as a result of these foreign currency forward and option contracts 
interest rate sensitivity we had an investment portfolio of fixed income securities  including those classified as security deposits  of million at january  these securities are subject to interest rate fluctuations and will decrease in market value if interest rates increase 
a sensitivity analysis was performed on our investment portfolio as of january  this sensitivity analysis is based on a modeling technique that measures the hypothetical market value changes that would result from a parallel shift in the yield curve of plus  plus or plus basis points occurring in either six months or months 
for the month time horizon the market value changes for a   or basis point increase were reductions of million  million and million  respectively 
for the month time horizon the market value changes for a  or basis point increase were reductions of million  million and million  respectively 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio to manage interest rate risk 
we place our investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards  as specified in our investment policy guidelines  which limits the amount of credit exposure to any one issue  issuer or type of instrument 
investments in privately held businesses we have an investment portfolio with a remaining net book value of approximately million as of january  that includes minority equity investments in several privately held technology companies  many of which are in the development stage 
we account for these minority equity investments using the cost method of accounting because our ownership interests are less than percent and we do not have the ability to exert significant influence on the investees 
these investments are inherently risky because the markets for the technologies or products the portfolio companies have under development are typically in the early stages and may never develop into commercially viable products 
we assess the value of these investments on a regular basis and when we identify other than temporary declines in the values of these investments  we write down the carrying values to their fair values 
write downs totaled million in fiscal  million in fiscal and million in fiscal due to the inherently risky nature of these investments  we may incur additional losses in the future up to the remaining carrying value of million recorded in our consolidated balance sheet at january
