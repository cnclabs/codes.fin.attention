item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following should be read in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and related notes included elsewhere in this k 
overview we are a leading provider of solutions that enable community banks to manage accounts receivable financing provided to their small business customers 
our solution is called business manager  and is based on software  marketing  and online electronic transaction processing services 
one element of business manager is our proprietary software  which enables our network of client banks to purchase accounts receivable from their small business customers 
the banks then process  bill and track those receivables on an ongoing basis 
as a major component of our program  we work with client banks to design  implement and manage the sale of business manager accounts receivable financing services to their small business customers 
we also give our client banks the option of outsourcing to us their application hosting and transaction processing through secure internet connections  allowing them to receive accounts receivable information and make funding decisions electronically 
on august   we completed a merger with towne services  inc towne into private business 
the merger was structured as a tax free exchange of approximately million shares of our common shares valued at approximately million for all the issued and outstanding towne common shares and common share equivalents 
table of contents and the issuance of approximately  common stock options valued at million to replace all of the issued and outstanding towne common stock options 
also  as a condition of the merger  on august   we issued  shares of series b convertible preferred stock valued at approximately  in exchange for all the issued and outstanding towne series b preferred stock 
the merger was accounted for as a purchase in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 business combinations 
we recorded approximately million in tangible assets million of which was cash and cash equivalents  million in intangible assets  million in goodwill and assumed liabilities of approximately million 
as a result of the merger  private business former shareholders own approximately of the outstanding shares of the combined entity 
in conjunction with the merger agreement  a one for three reverse stock split of our common stock occurred prior to the exchange of our common shares for the towne common shares and common share equivalents 
subsequent to the merger  we began the process of converting all towne credit and towne finance customers to our business manager solution 
this process was completed in october of as a result  as of december   there are no remaining towne credit or towne finance users and  as such  we have eliminated these product lines 
the remaining towne revenue sources are cash flow manager  sm and rmsa merchandise planning service  which processes sales and inventory transactions and provides merchandise forecasting information for specialty retail stores  and ancillary services related to these products 
in previous filings we have discussed that part of our growth strategy is to acquire or develop new products or services 
we have initiated development activities in several areas 
one is a new program  similar to our business manager accounts receivable financing management product that will eventually allow banks to offer commercial insurance products  including property  general liability and workers compensation  to their business customers in a very competitive and cost effective manner 
with over large banking organizations having acquired insurance brokerage firms in recent years  we anticipate that this product will allow community banks to be more competitive 
currently  we have executed four contracts with banks to participate in this program 
another project is the development of a software product called linemanager lm  for commercial banks that would allow them to electronically monitor their conventional line of credit loans directly from their borrowers accounting system 
the majority of commercial banks do not have the capability to routinely monitor their collateral for working capital lines of credit 
this fact  along with credit officers and bank regulators expressing concern over the deteriorating credit conditions in the current economy  have led many of our banking clients to request a product of this type for their secured loans 
our system  which completed beta testing in early  is designed to allow our client banks to monitor loans in a manner similar to the way large financial institutions monitor their asset based loans but on an asp application service provider basis with no additional labor impact for the bank 
currently  we have executed contracts with eight banks for this product 
significant accounting policies and estimates management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations are based upon the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in accordance with generally accepted accounting principals requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the dates of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
on an on going basis  management evaluates its critical accounting policies and estimates 
in december  the securities and exchange commission sec requested that all registrants list their three to five critical accounting policies in the text of management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
the sec indicated that a critical accounting policy is one that is both important to the understanding of the financial condition and results of operations of the company and requires management s most difficult  subjective or complex judgments  often as a result of the need to make estimates about the effect of matters that are inherently uncertain 
management believes the following accounting policies fit this definition 
table of contents revenue recognition 
we generate revenue from four main sources participation fees earned on client bank purchases of small business accounts receivable 
software license fees from new client banks 
retail planning services 
maintenance fees and other revenues  comprised primarily of fees received for insurance brokerage services  paper based form sales  software maintenance  medical  and processing services 
there are two types of participation fees 
the first type is earned upon the client bank s initial purchase of a small business accounts receivable during the first days in our program 
the second type is an ongoing participation fee earned from subsequent period purchases 
both types of fees are based on a percentage of the receivables that a client bank purchases from its small business customers during each month 
the second type of fee is a smaller percentage of the ongoing receivables purchased 
participation fees are recognized as earned 
software license fees for business manager consist of two components the license fee and customer training and support fee 
these are one time fees that we receive upon the initial licensing of our business manager program to a community bank 
our license agreements are executed with terms ranging from three to five years  and are renewable for subsequent terms 
some agreements contain performance or deferred payment terms that must be met in order for us to receive payment and recognize revenue 
we recognize revenues from the license fee once we have met the terms of the customer agreement 
the customer training and support fee are recognized ratably over the twelve month service period subsequent to the activation of the license agreement 
retail planning services revenue is generated from fees charged primarily for providing inventory merchandising and forecasting information for specialty retail stores and ancillary services related to these products 
rmsa uses a proprietary software to process sales and inventory transactions and provide the merchandising forecasting information 
we recognize revenues as the transactions occur and merchandising and forecasting services are performed 
maintenance fees and other revenues include several ancillary products and services we provide to client banks 
annual software maintenance fees are generated from our client banks starting on the first anniversary date of the business manager license agreement and annually thereafter 
these revenues are recognized ratably over a twelve month period beginning on the first anniversary date of the agreement 
additionally  since  we have brokered  through our private business insurance subsidiary  credit and fraud insurance products from a national insurance company 
we earn fees based on a percentage of the premium that is paid to the insurance company 
we also provide a standard set of forms that client banks may purchase and use in the normal course of administering the business manager program 
revenues related to these forms are recognized in the period that they are shipped to the client bank 
we also offer processing services to our client banks for an additional fee  based on the volume of transactions processed through the system 
we also have some industry focused applications for the medical and dental markets 
monthly transaction processing fees include charges for electronic processing  statement rendering and mailing  settling payments  recording account changes and new accounts  leasing and selling point of sale terminals  telephone and software support services  rental fees and collecting debts 
software development costs 
software development costs incurred in the research and development of new software products and enhancements to existing software products are expensed as incurred until technological feasibility has been established 
after such time  any additional costs are capitalized in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed 
capitalized software development costs are amortized on a straight line basis over three years 

table of contents self insurance reserves 
the company was primarily self insured for employee medical costs with certain limits of per claim and aggregate stop loss insurance coverage that management considers adequate 
the company maintains an accrual for these costs based on claims filed and an estimate of claims incurred but not reported 
the difference between actual settlements and recorded accruals are expensed in the period identified 
the company was self insured for employee medical claims up to  per employee per year or an aggregate of approximately million per year 
effective january  the company ceased being self insured for medical costs 
results of operations the following table sets forth  for the periods indicated  the percentage relationship of the identified consolidated statement of operations items to total revenues

participation fees decreased million  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the participation fees for and include fees of approximately million and million from the towne merger  which was effective august  the decrease was primarily due to two reasons  a decrease in the average participation rate and a decrease in the total funding through our business manager program 
the average participation rate declined to 
in as compared to 
in the decreased average participation rate was due to two factors 
first  our bank customers  in response to continued declines in interest rates  were forced to lower their service charge  which has a direct effect on our participation rates 
secondly  in reaction to competitive pressures and the general slow down in the economy  we were forced to make some rate concessions to avoid customer attrition 
total receivables funded through business manager declined to billion in compared to billion in the decreased funding was primarily the result of fewer banks funding through our business manager program during as compared to as a percentage of total revenue  participation fees decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year earlier period 

table of contents software license 
software license fees decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to  for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of new software license agreements funded during compared to although more new business manager licenses were sold in  the average license fees paid declined significantly 
this was primarily the result of the company discounting our license fees during the months of march and september in order to stimulate our software license activity 
software license fees accounted for of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the year earlier period primarily as a result of the decrease in fees discussed above 
retail planning services 
retail planning services revenue increased to million as compared to million in the million of revenue in was for the period august  through december   as a result of our merger with towne 
as a percentage of total revenues  retail planning services accounted for during maintenance and other 
maintenance and other revenues decreased approximately  or  to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  processing fees decreased approximately  or to million in from million in this decrease resulted primarily from decreased marketing of our processing capabilities and management s decision to convert some processing center banks to self processing banks  which resulted in decreased utilization of our processing services by our client banks 
also contributing to the decline  insurance commission revenues decreased approximately  to million in from million in  as well as a medical processing revenues decline of approximately  to  in from  in these decreases were partially offset by an increase in factoring commission revenues of approximately  to  in from  in as a percentage of total revenues  maintenance and other revenue decreased to for the year ended december   from for the year ended december  total revenues

as a percentage of total revenues  general and administrative expenses remained relatively constant at approximately for the two years ended december  selling and marketing 
selling and marketing expenses decreased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  selling and marketing expenses include cost of wages and commissions paid to our dedicated business development  bank and retail planning sales force  travel costs of the dedicated sales force  recruiting for new sales and marketing personnel and marketing fees associated with direct and telemarketing programs 
the decrease was primarily due to decreases in sales staff 
we also decreased our marketing programs  particularly telemarketing  as a result of focusing more specifically on banks in targeted markets 
the decrease was slightly offset by increased commission expense relating to the addition of the sales people with rmsa who were added as a result of the towne merger 
as a percentage of total revenues  selling and marketing expenses decreased to for the year ended december   compared to for the year ended december  research and development 
research and development expenses decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the previous year ended december  these costs include the non capitalizable direct costs associated with developing new versions of the business manager software  as well as  other software development projects that do not meet the capitalization rules 
the decrease was primarily due to more projects in as opposed to that met the software development cost capitalization rules 
particularly  the development of our linemanager product in  which was released to beta testing in the fourth quarter of  was a major project that utilized significant internal resources that were capitalizable  whereas in more of these resources were spent on non capitalizable projects 
as a percentage of total revenues  research and 
table of contents development expenses decreased to for the year ended december  from for the year ended december  amortization 
amortization expenses increased to approximately million for the year ended december   compared to approximately million for the previous year 
these expenses include the cost of amortizing intangible assets including trademarks and the associated costs of goodwill only for  software development costs  and debt issuance costs related to our recapitalization in as well as identified intangibles recorded from the towne merger 
included in is approximately  of amortization related to identifiable intangibles that were adjusted in june of to their appraised values  of which  relates to prior periods 
there was no goodwill amortization recorded during in accordance with sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
the amount of goodwill amortized in was approximately  other operating expenses 
other operating expenses decreased approximately million for the year ended december   to approximately  other operating expenses include property tax and other miscellaneous costs associated with providing support and services to our client banks 
the decrease was primarily due to the write down of land  building and furniture at the company headquarters to its estimated fair market value in  which totaled million 
excluding the million property write down in  other operating expenses remained relatively constant at less than for the two years ended december  operating income 
as a result of the above factors  our operating income increased to million for the year ended december   compared to million for the previous year 
interest expense  net 
interest expense  net decreased million to million for the year ended december   compared to million in the decrease was primarily due to the reduction of our debt and more favorable interest rates

software license 
software license fees decreased to  for the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  the decrease was primarily due to a decrease in the number of new software license agreements funded during compared to we believe that new software license agreements have decreased as a result of several contributing factors  including our focus on marketing more specifically to banks in targeted areas where we wish to penetrate the small business market 
further  we believe that with the current economic slowdown and the fact that as we increase our penetration into a market  it becomes more difficult to add new license agreements from the smaller universe of potential bank clients 
software license fees accounted for of total revenues for the year ended december   compared to for the year earlier period primarily as a result of the decrease in fees discussed above  more rapid growth in maintenance and other revenues and the new revenues resulting from the towne merger

the company is the borrower under a credit agreement dated august  between the company as borrower  fleet national bank as administrative agent and a syndicate of other lenders 
this credit facility has been amended from time to time 
the credit facility is secured by a pledge of all of our assets and contains financial and non financial covenants and contains limitations on our ability to sell material assets  redeem capital stock and pay cash dividends  among other actions 
on april   we entered into an amendment to our credit facility that waives the non monetary default we announced on january  relating to the breach of certain financial covenants for the quarter ended december  the amended credit facility also modifies financial and certain non financial covenants for and requires us to take certain other actions as set forth in the amended credit facility 
pursuant to the amendment  we agreed to pay certain fees to our lenders  to increase the interest rates payable under the credit facility  and to use our best efforts to consummate a capital event as defined in the amended credit facility on or before december  our amended credit facility includes term loans with current balances of million the term a loan and million the term b loan  and reduces our revolving line of credit from million to the lesser of million or of the eligible receivables as defined in the amended credit facility 
the revolving line of credit includes swing line advances and a million sublimit for standby letters of credit 
the interest rate for the term a loan and any advances under the revolving loan is over the eurodollar rate or over the prime rate 
the interest rate for the term b loan is over the eurodollar rate or over the prime rate 
the applicable margin on all outstanding loans increases by on january  
table of contents the amended credit facility also includes a provision requiring early payment on the term loans if we have excess cash  as defined in the credit agreement  on hand at year end 
at december   no excess cash payments were required

the million term loan is repayable in equal quarterly installments of  until december   at which time the required quarterly payments increase to million until september  and million until december  with a final payment of million due march  the revolver bears an annual commitment fee and matures august  as of december   we had million outstanding at  million outstanding at   in standby letters of credit and  outstanding draws against the revolver at 
as of december   we had a working capital deficit of approximately million compared to a working capital deficit of approximately million as of december  the change in working capital resulted primarily from decreases in cash  accounts receivable and deferred tax assets totaling approximately million  partially offset by decreases in accounts payable  accrued liabilities and deferred revenue totaling million 
the decreases in cash and accounts receivable are primarily the result of lower revenues in the fourth quarter of the decreases in accounts payable and accrued liabilities are primarily attributable to the payments of assumed liabilities from the towne merger 
we believe that the existing cash available  future operating cash flows and our revolving line of credit will be sufficient to meet our working capital  debt service and capital expenditure requirements for the next twelve months 
furthermore  we expect to be in compliance with the amended covenants throughout there can be no assurance the company will have sufficient cash flows to meet its obligations or that the company will remain in compliance with the amended covenants and non compliance with these covenants could have a material adverse impact to the company s operating and financial results

table of contents we may  in the future  acquire businesses or products complementary to our business  although we cannot be certain that any such acquisitions will be made 
the need for cash to finance additional working capital or to make acquisitions may cause us to seek additional equity or debt financing 
we cannot be certain that such financing will be available  or that our need for higher levels of working capital will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition or results of operations

sfas no 
was effective for all acquisitions consummated subsequent to june  and was followed by the company in its merger with towne in august sfas no 
was effective for the company beginning on january  as such  the company s recorded goodwill of million was not amortized in  but was subject to annual impairment evaluation as outlined in sfas no 
the company recorded approximately  annually of goodwill amortization during the two years ended december  the company performed the transitional impairment evaluation as of january  during the second quarter of as required by sfas no 
the evaluation concluded that there was no impairment of the recorded goodwill 
the company performed its first annual impairment evaluation as of december   noting no goodwill impairment as of that date 
in april  the fasb issued sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
 and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
the statement rescinds fasb statement no 
 reporting gains and losses from extinguishment of debt  and amendment of that statement  fasb no 
 extinguishments of debt made to satisfy sinking fund requirements 
the company elected to early adopt this statement for the year ended december  as a result of this early adoption the company has reclassified amounts that had previously been reported as extraordinary loss of  net of taxes  in to other operating expenses in the accompanying consolidated statements of operations 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  requiring that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
sfas no 
 which applies to all entities  is effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  the company expects that the adoption of sfas no 
during fiscal will not materially impact the company s financial position or results of operations 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure  which amends sfas no 
sfas no 
provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require more prominent and more frequent disclosures in financial statements about the effects of stock based compensation 
sfas no 
is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years ending after december   and interim disclosure provisions are effective for financial reports containing financial statements for interim periods beginning after december  the company has elected to account for its stock based compensation plans under the intrinsic value based method of accounting prescribed by accounting principles board opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and does not utilize the fair value method 
however  the company has adopted the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
 and has adopted the additional disclosure requirements as specified in sfas for the year ended december  at the november  emerging issues task force eitf meeting  the task force reached a consensus in issue  multiple deliverable revenue arrangements  which addresses how to account for arrangements that may involve the delivery or performance of multiple products  services  or rights to use assets  other 
table of contents than those arrangements accounted for under other more specific literature 
the final consensus will be applicable to agreements entered into in fiscal periods beginning after june  with early adoption permitted 
additionally  companies will be permitted to apply the consensus guidance to all existing arrangements as the cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle in accordance with apb opinion no 
 accounting changes 
the company expects that adoption of this new consensus will not have a material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
seasonality we have generally realized lower revenues and income in the first quarter and  to a lesser extent  in the second quarter of the year 
we believe that this is primarily due to a general slowdown in economic activity following the fourth quarter s holiday season and  more specifically  a decrease in purchased receivables by our client banks 
therefore  we believe that period to period comparisons of our operating results are not necessarily meaningful and that such comparison cannot be relied upon as indicators of our future performance 
due to the relatively fixed nature of costs such as personnel  facilities and equipment costs  a revenue decline in a quarter will typically result in lower profitability for that quarter 
inflation we do not believe that inflation has had a material effect on our results of operations 
there can be no assurance  however  that our business will not be affected by inflation in the future 
note regarding forward looking information this report contains several forward looking statements concerning our operations  prospects  strategies and financial condition  including our future economic performance  intent  plans and objectives  and the likelihood of success in developing and expanding our business 
these statements are based upon a number of assumptions and estimates which are subject to significant uncertainties  many of which are beyond our control 
words such as may  would  could  expect  anticipate  believe  intend  plan  and estimate are meant to identify such forward looking statements 
actual results may differ materially from those expressed or implied by such forward looking statements 
factors that could cause actual results to differ materially are discussed in business risk factors and elsewhere in this report on form k  and include  among other factors  liquidity and capital resources  the timely development and market acceptance of products and technologies  and competitive market conditions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates based on our financing and cash management activities 
our exposure relates primarily to our long term debt obligations which expire in and in the event that interest rates associated with these debt obligations were to increase basis points  the impact on future cash flows would be approximately  annually
