item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
you should read the following discussion and analysis together with our financial statements  related notes and other financial information appearing elsewhere in this report 
in addition to historical information  the following discussion and other parts of this report contain forward looking information that involves risks and uncertainties 
our actual results could differ materially from those anticipated by such forward looking information due to competitive factors and other factors discussed under forward looking statements below and under important factors that may affect future results in exhibit to this annual report on form k 
overview we are a world leader in the development  manufacture  and application of innovative vacuum technology solutions for the semiconductor  data storage  and flat panel display markets 
our vacuum systems provide enabling technology for several key steps within the semiconductor manufacturing process  including ion implantation  physical vapor deposition  chemical vapor deposition and etching 
semiconductor manufacturers use our systems to create and maintain a vacuum environment  which is critical to their manufacturing processes 
we are a leading provider of vacuum systems technology to the world s largest semiconductor capital equipment and semiconductor manufacturers  placing us at a critical point in their advanced technology manufacturing process 
we have long standing customer relationships with many semiconductor capital equipment manufacturers  including applied materials  axcelis  matsushita  novellus  varian semiconductor and veeco  as well as semiconductor manufacturers such as agere  atmel  fuji tsu  infineon  intel  motorola  nec  samsung  stmicroelectronics and texas instruments 
our products are also used in a broad range of industrial manufacturing applications and advanced research and development laboratories 
we also provide an extensive range of global support and vacuum system monitoring services that lower our end users total costs of ownership 
we increase our customers system uptime through rapid response to potential operating problems 
we also develop and deliver enhancements to our customers installed base of production tools 
our service offerings include our unique guts guaranteed up time support customer response system and our innovative goldlink global on line diagnostics support system  which provides a remote e diagnostics solution that allows us to monitor  in real time  the vacuum system performance of our customers production tools 
our goldlink capability has made us a leading total solution provider in the emerging market for internet based  proactive e diagnostics for the semiconductor and semiconductor capital equipment industries 
the principal market we serve is the global semiconductor capital equipment industry  a highly cyclical business 
as a result  we have experienced significant variations in net sales  expenses  and results of operations in the periods presented and such variations are likely to continue 
significant accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our results of operations and liquidity and capital resources are based on our consolidated financial statements which have been prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states 
the preparation of these financial statements requires us to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
on an ongoing basis  we evaluate our estimates and judgments  including those related to revenue recognition  adequacy of reserves  valuation of investments and income taxes 
we base our estimates on historical and anticipated results and trends and on various other assumptions that we believe are reasonable under the circumstances  including assumptions as to future events 
these estimates form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
by their natu re  estimates are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
actual results may differ from our estimates 
we believe that the following significant accounting policies and assumptions may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity than others 
revenue recognition 
we recognize net sales from product sales upon shipment provided title and risk of loss have been transferred to the customer  there is persuasive evidence of an arrangement  fees are fixed or determinable  and collection is reasonably assured 
net sales from global support services is recognized as performed or ratably over the period of the related agreements 
we recognize net sales from upgrade sales upon customer acceptance provided installation has been completed 
as part of a sale  we offer customers a warranty on defects in materials and workmanship 
we continuously monitor and track the related product returns and record a provision for the estimated amount of such future returns  based on historical experience and any notification we receive of pending returns 
while such returns have historically been within our expectations and the provisions established  we cannot guarantee that we will continue to experience the same return rates that we have in the past 
any signific ant increase in material and workmanship defect rates and the resulting credit returns could have a material adverse impact on our operating results for the period or periods in which such returns materialize 
we also maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
inventory and reserves for excess and obsolescence 
we value inventory at the lower of cost first in  first out method or market 
we regularly review inventory quantities on hand and record a provision to write down inventory to its estimated net realizable value  if less than cost  based upon management s assumptions of future material usage and obsolescence  which are a result of future demand and market conditions 
if actual market conditions become less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory provisions may be required 
if inventory is written down to its net realizable value and subsequently there is an increased demand for the inventory at a higher value  the increased value of the inventory is not realized until the inventory is sold  which will result in improved margins in the period 
investments 
we own of a joint venture  ulvac cryogenics  inc  or uci  which manufactures and sells cryogenic vacuum pumps in japan  principally to ulvac corporation 
we account for the joint venture using the equity method of accounting  and we also receive royalties from the joint venture under the terms of a license and technology agreement 
the royalties we receive from uci  as well as our equity in the income and losses of uci  are both included in our financial statements under joint venture income 
restructuring charges 
during and  we recorded significant charges in connection with our restructuring programs 
the related reserves reflect estimates  including those pertaining to severance costs and settlements of contractual obligations 
we reassess the reserve requirements to complete each individual plan under our restructuring programs at the end of each reporting period 
actual experience may be different from these estimates 
for more information  see note i to the consolidated financial statements 
tax contingencies 
tax contingencies are recorded to address potential exposures involving tax positions we have taken that could be challenged by taxing authorities 
these potential exposures result from the varying application of statutes  rules  regulations and interpretations 
our estimate of the value of our tax contingencies contains assumptions based on past experiences and judgments about potential actions by taxing jurisdictions 
it is reasonably likely that the ultimate resolution of these matters may be greater or less than the amount that we have accrued 
results of operations fiscal year ended december   compared to the fiscal year ended december  in  we continued to experience the significant slowdown in the global market for semiconductor capital equipment that began in net sales for were million as compared with net sales for of million  a decrease of 
we are currently experiencing stable weekly order bookings  however  visibility remains unclear 
cost of sales for was million compared with million for  a decrease of 
the gross margin for was compared with for cost of sales for included an additional fourth quarter charge for excess and obsolete inventory totaling million resulting from the significant slowdown in the global market for semiconductor capital equipment and from expected efficiencies to be gained in our future delivery of global customer support 
we monitor and forecast expected inventory needs based on our constantly changing sales forecast and writedown or writeoff inventory when it becomes obsolete or when it is deemed excess 
excluding these charges  the gross margin for would have been  a decline from  primarily due to lower sales volume that reduced utilization of manufacturing capacity 
research and development expenses were million for  or of net sales  compared to million for  or of net sales 
we maintain a commitment to developing technologies to support a new generation of products for millimeter capable production tools  to expand our support service capability and to improve our core component product lines 
total selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  as compared with for the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to the nonrecurring litigation settlement charge of million in total selling  general and administrative expenses excluding the nonrecurring litigation settlement charge remained consistent with the prior year  reflecting a decrease in spending due to the restructuring program completed in the third quarter of offset by an increase in depreciation expense associated with our new global information system and associated startup costs 
depreciation expenses are expected to remain at their current levels in however  our ongoing cost containment and cost reduction initiatives are expected to reduce future selling  general and administrative expenses 
restructurings and other charges recorded during the fourth quarter of were associated with the initiation of a worldwide cost reduction program and the suspension of an internal use software development program in response to the continued duration and severity of the slowdown in the semiconductor capital equipment industry 
the million charged to restructurings and other charges is comprised of million of employee severance costs  million to consolidate leased facilities  and million to write off certain software 
the employee costs of million primarily consist of severance and fringe benefits to terminate approximately employees 
the affected employees  most of whom were located in the united states  were primarily full time nonmanufacturing employees 
notification and termination benefits were communicated to employees in the fourth quarter of the majority of the terminations took place in  and the remaining terminations are expected in the first quarter of all remaining severance benefits are expected to be paid in full during the company expects to realize approximately million in quarterly savings from the reduction in force 
the million of net exit costs related to facility closures resulted from the planned consolidation of customer support facilities located in massachusetts  facility reductions of satellite sales and customer support facilities located in texas  arizona  and california  and consolidation of sales and service centers located in japan 
these accrued costs reflect payments required under operating lease contracts in excess of expected sub lease rentals and costs for writing down related leasehold improvements at the affected facilities 
the consolidation of these facilities is expected to result in quarterly cost savings of approximately million 
we also suspended an internal use software development program given current market conditions and timing of market application  resulting in a million charge 
royalty and equity income from our joint venture in japan for decreased to million from million in due to the continued decline in the japanese semiconductor capital equipment market 
interest and other income was million for both and in  higher average cash  cash equivalent and investment balances resulting from the public offering completed in march were offset by lower interest rates 
we had a pretax loss of million in  resulting in a tax benefit of million  compared with a pretax loss of million and a tax benefit of million for the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the tax rates differ from the us statutory rate primarily due to tax credits and undistributed nontaxable equity income from our joint venture 
these tax credits and equity income increase our tax rate on pretax losses and decrease our tax rate on pretax income 
the decline in the tax rate was primarily attributable to the decline in the benefit received from lower undistributed nontaxable equity income from our joint venture 
fiscal year ended december   compared to the fiscal year ended december  in  a slowdown in the global market for semiconductor capital equipment impacted us after we had experienced a period of significant growth in and our net sales for were million compared with net sales for of million  a decrease of 
cost of sales for was million compared with million for  a decrease of 
the gross margin for was compared with for the reduction in gross margin was primarily attributable to decreased production volume as overhead costs were spread over a smaller sales base 
research and development expenses were million for both and  or and of net sales in and  respectively 
despite the significant near term reduction in product demand  we continued in to focus on developing technologies to support a new generation of products for millimeter capable production tools  to expand our goldlink support service capability and to improve our core component product lines 
total selling  general and administrative expenses decreased to million in compared with million in our spending declined due to cost containment measures  including reductions in senior management compensation expenses  initiated during during the third quarter of  we implemented and completed a restructuring program in response to the continued slowdown in the semiconductor capital equipment industry that resulted in the reduction of approximately permanent employees 
as a result  we recorded a restructuring charge of approximately million primarily related to severance payments and fringe benefit costs 
royalty and equity income from our joint venture in japan decreased by million to million in from million in  due to the decline in the japanese semiconductor capital equipment market in interest and other income for was million  compared with million for  reflecting lower interest rates and lower average cash  cash equivalent and investment balances in we had a pretax loss of million in  resulting in a tax benefit of million  compared with pretax income of million and a tax provision of million for the effective tax rates for and were and  respectively 
the tax rates differ from the us statutory rate primarily due to tax credits and undistributed nontaxable equity income from our joint venture 
these tax credits and equity income reduced our tax rate on pretax income and increased our tax rate on pretax losses 
quarterly financial results the following table presents selected unaudited financial information for the eight quarters in the period ended december  the results for any quarter are not necessarily indicative of future quarterly results and  accordingly  period to period comparisons should not be relied upon as an indication of future performance

we expect capital expenditures for to be only slightly lower than due to the consolidation of facilities related to our restructuring plan and to support ongoing business initiatives 
on march   we completed a public offering of  shares of our common stock 
we realized proceeds of million  net of underwriting fees and discounts and offering expenses 
cash dividends paid to our stockholders during were million  compared with million for we paid a quarterly common stock dividend of per share for the first three quarters of in october  after considering the uncertain business environment in the semiconductor equipment industry  our board of directors reduced the quarterly dividend to per share 
after paying the quarterly dividend of per share for the first three quarters of  our board of directors further reduced the quarterly dividend to per share in october  due to the continuing uncertain business environment and lack of visibility in the semiconductor capital equipment market 
we had an agreement with a bank to sell specific japanese yen denominated receivables  subject to recourse provisions 
in  we terminated this agreement and  as a result  did not have any amounts outstanding at december we manage our foreign exchange rate risk arising from intercompany foreign currency denominated transactions through the use of foreign currency forward contracts 
the gains and losses on these transactions are not material 
we had a three year revolving credit agreement with fleet national bank entered into in july that permitted us to borrow up to million  subject to compliance with certain covenants 
we never borrowed against the agreement and terminated it in april we believe that our existing funds and anticipated cash flow from operations will satisfy our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next months 
legal proceedings we concluded a settlement with raytheon company pursuant to an agreement in principle dated july   in connection with an action brought in in massachusetts superior court  and involving allegations of defects in certain components we discontinued selling in while we continuously denied all claims  the company and its insurers concluded that it was in our best interest to reach an out of court settlement to avoid the distraction and expense of a jury trial 
under the terms of the settlement  we paid million and insurance providers paid an additional million and essentially all of the legal costs associated with the litigation 
we may be involved in various legal proceedings in the normal course of business 
we are not a party to any proceedings that involve amounts that would have a material effect on our financial position or results of operations if such proceedings were resolved unfavorably 
recent accounting pronouncements in october  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
the objectives of sfas are to address significant issues relating to the implementation of fasb statement no 
sfas  accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of  and to develop a single accounting model  based on the framework established in sfas  for long lived assets to be disposed of by sale  whether previously held and used or newly acquired 
sfas is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after december   and  generally  its provisions are to be applied prospectively 
at the time we adopted this standard in  it did not have a material impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in june  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force issue eitf no 
we will adopt the provision of sfas for restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf  a liability for an exit cost was recognized at the date of our commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
in december  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
sfas  which is effective for financial statements for fiscal years ending after december   with early adoption permitted 
sfas will enable companies that choose to adopt the preferable fair value based method to report the full effect of employee stock options in their financial statements immediately upon adoption  and to make available to investors better and more frequent disclosure about the cost of employee stock options 
we will continue to apply the disclosure only provisions of both sfas and sfas forward looking statements this annual report on form k contains forward looking statements 
these forward looking statements appear principally in the sections entitled business and management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements may appear in other sections of this report as well 
generally  the forward looking statements in this report use words like expect  anticipate  plan  believe  seek  estimate  and similar expressions 
the forward looking statements include statements about our strategic plans  the outlook for our business and industry  anticipated expenses  anticipated sources of future revenues  and the sufficiency of capital to meet working capital and capital expenditure requirements 
forward looking statements are not guarantees of future performance and involve certain risks  uncertainties  and assumptions that could cause our future results to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on our behalf 
many such factors are beyond our ability to control or predict 
readers are accordingly cautioned not to place undue reliance on forward looking statements 
we disclaim any intent or obligation to update publicly any forward looking statements  whether in response to new information  future events  or otherwise 
our business depends in large part upon the capital expenditures of semiconductor manufacturers  which  in turn  depend on the current and anticipated market demand for integrated circuits and products utilizing integrated circuits 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical and has historically experienced periodic downturns  which generally have had a severe effect on the semiconductor industry s demand for capital equipment and have adversely affected our results of operations 
we cannot assure you that developments in the semiconductor industry or the semiconductor equipment industry will occur at the rate or in the manner that we expect 
in addition to the cyclical nature  risks and uncertainties of the semiconductor industry  the company faces the following risks and uncertainties among others dependence on a limited number of customers and concentration of sales to one or a few customers  reduction of potential customers due to industry consolidation and outsourcing of the manufacture of semiconductors  the need to continuously develop  manufacture  and gain customers acceptance of new products and product enhancements  the need to achieve widespread market acceptance among our customers and others of our service initiative  our ability to continue to provide satisfactory levels of product services and maintenance and warranty support to our customers  our ability to compete successfully with current and future competitors in our industry  our ability to continue necessary capital investments during industry downturns and to anticipate or expand sales  dependence upon sole and limited source suppliers for certain components and subassemblies included in our products and systems  potential liability claims based on alleged defects in our products or errors in performing product related services  economic downturns abroad affecting our sales to foreign markets  our ability to protect our proprietary technology without substantial costs and disruption to our core business strategy  our ability to attract and retain certain key personnel  and our ability to expand through acquisitions of complementary businesses and to integrate successfully any acquired companies 
as a result of the foregoing and other factors  we may experience material fluctuations in our future operating results on a quarterly or annual basis  which could materially affect our business  financial position  results of operations  and stock price 
these risks and uncertainties are discussed in more detail in exhibit to this annual report on form k 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk foreign currency exchange rate risk a portion of our business is conducted outside the united states through our foreign subsidiaries 
our foreign subsidiaries maintain their accounting records in their local currencies 
consequently  fluctuations in exchange rates affect the period to period comparability of results 
to reduce the risks associated with foreign currency rate fluctuations  we have entered into forward exchange contracts on a continuing basis to offset the currency exposures 
the gains and losses on these transactions partially offset the unrealized and realized foreign exchange gains and losses of the underlying exposures 
the net gains and losses were immaterial for the years presented and were included in cost of sales 
we plan to continue to use forward exchange contracts to mitigate the impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
the notional amount of our outstanding foreign currency contracts at december   was million 
the potential fair value loss for a hypothetical adverse change in forward currency exchange rates at december   would be million  which would be essentially offset by corresponding gains related to underlying assets 
the potential loss was estimated calculating the fair value of the forward exchange contracts at december   and comparing that with the value calculated using the hypothetical forward currency exchange rates 
credit risk we are exposed to concentration of credit risk in cash and cash equivalents  investments  trade receivables  and short term foreign exchange forward contracts 
we place our cash and cash equivalents with major financial institutions  with high quality credit ratings 
our investments consist of money market funds  municipal government agencies  and tax free bonds or investment grade securities 
we enter into short term foreign currency exchange contracts with our primary bank
