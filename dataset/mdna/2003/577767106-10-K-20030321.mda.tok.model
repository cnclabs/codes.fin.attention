item business overview maxwell sells reliability 
we develop  manufacture and market electronic components and systems that perform reliably for the life of the end products and systems into which they are integrated 
our customer value proposition is based on the guarantee that our products will not fail 
we achieve high reliability through the application of proprietary technology  and through rigorously controlled design  development  manufacturing and test processes 
our strategic focus on high reliability enables us to deliver high value products that ensure mission critical uptime  durability and full functionality of our customers end products and  therefore  to command higher profit margins than traditional electronic products 
based on our strategy  we develop  manufacture and market high reliability power and microelectronic products for original equipment manufacturers oems in multiple industries 
our power products address applications in transportation  telecommunications  consumer and industrial electronics  electric utility infrastructure and medical imaging and industrial automation systems 
our microelectronics products primarily address applications in aerospace 
our power product lines are comprised of ultracapacitors  high voltage capacitors  and custom power and energy storage systems 
our microelectronic product lines are comprised of radiation shielded power modules  memory modules and single board computers 
we also design and sell automated winding equipment used to produce metalized film capacitors and lithium batteries 
in the second half of  we initiated a series of steps to intensify the focus on our strategy and to exit non strategic businesses in july  we acquired montena components ltd  a swiss manufacturer and marketer of ultracapacitors  high voltage capacitors and battery and capacitor winding equipment 
this acquisition brought to maxwell additional power business focused on high reliability components and additional design and production capabilities that enhance maxwell s profile as a reliable  global supplier 
montena components is located in rossens  switzerland  near major automotive and industrial development and manufacturing centers in germany  france and italy 
in september  we suspended the operations of our purepulse technologies subsidiary  which had been developing pulsed light purification systems 
we are preserving purepulse s intellectual property for a possible future sale 
in september  we sold the computing systems business of our i bus phoenix subsidiary 
although that business had a strategic focus on high reliability high availability computer servers  the markets for such systems  particularly telecommunications  had deteriorated so dramatically that we concluded that near term growth prospects for our computing systems business were limited 
in september  we sold our non core teknaseal glass to metal seals business and in december  we sold a small power factor correction product line that did not fit our high reliability strategy 
during the third quarter of  we began integrating the power systems business of i bus phoenix into our electronic components group 
our current power systems products address the high reliability and power quality requirements of our medical imaging and industrial automation systems oem customers 
new power system products scheduled for introduction in incorporate our ultracapacitor and other proprietary power electronics technologies to address high reliability back up power applications in the industrial market 
in early  we completed the integration and relocation of our power systems business into our principal manufacturing facility in san diego  california  and vacated and listed for sale the company owned facility that formerly housed the north american operations of i bus phoenix 
this consolidation allows more efficient use of our remaining facilities and personnel  and the sale of the vacated facility will provide the company with additional cash resources 
also in early  we formed an ultracapacitor manufacturing and marketing alliance in china with yeong long technologies co  ltd  a million per annum manufacturer of electrolytic capacitors  to commercialize our proprietary boostcap ultracapacitors in china and to position us as a global supplier of ultracapacitors with production facilities in the us  europe and china 
with the completion of these actions  virtually all of maxwell s revenue now is derived from the sale of power and microelectronic products and winding equipment  and the company s internal operations are concentrated in two primary facilities  one in san diego  california  and the other in rossens  switzerland 
industry  markets and maxwell s solutions we have focused our business on high reliability power and microelectronic products and high reliability automated winding equipment 
high reliability power and microelectronic products ultracapacitors for electrical energy storage and delivery of peak power for a variety of applications 
high voltage grading and coupling capacitors and capacitor voltage dividers used in electric utility infrastructure  high voltage laboratories and other applications involving transport  distribution and measurement of high voltage electrical energy 
power distribution and power conditioning modules for integration into larger medical imaging and other industrial systems for delivery of consistent  high quality power 
radiation shielded microelectronic components  including power modules  memory modules and single board computers for aerospace and military applications 
winding machines and automated assembly lines used to manufacture metalized film capacitors and lithium batteries 
maxwell s solutions apply our expertise and proprietary power and microelectronics technology at both the component level and the systems level for specialized  high value applications in which the customer requires high reliability 
we intend to be a leading supplier of high reliability power and microelectronic components and systems for such specialized  high value applications 
energy storage and power delivery components ultracapacitors new power hungry electronic products such as digital cameras and wireless communications devices  increasing demand for electric power in trains and motor vehicles to assist vehicle power trains and to operate on board electronic systems  and the need for highly reliable back up power are creating significant markets for energy storage and power delivery 
in many applications  power demand varies widely from moment to moment  and peak power demand typically is much greater than the average power requirement 
for example  automobiles require much more power to accelerate from a stop than to maintain a constant speed 
in other applications  such as in digital cameras  more power is needed to display images on a screen than to store images in memory 
engineers generally address peak power needs by designing the primary energy source  such as an engine or a battery system  to the size needed to satisfy peak demands  even if those demands occur for only a few seconds at a time 
sizing an entire system for peak power needs  rather than for the average power requirement  is costly and inefficient 
such systems can be significantly improved by storing electrical energy generated from a primary energy source such as an engine or battery and then delivering that energy in controlled high power bursts only when high power is required 
such high power delivery provides electrical systems with dynamic power range to meet peak power demands for periods of time ranging from fractions of a second to several minutes 
this enables new functionality  reduces system size and cost and improves performance and reliability 
the following diagram presents the separation of energy storage and peak power delivery from a primary energy source 
the components that enable this separation permit new designs to optimize the efficiency and cost effectiveness of electrical power systems 
peak power application model 
jkimagejpg 
although batteries currently are the most widely used component for both primary energy sourcing and energy storage peak power delivery  ultracapacitors  advanced batteries and fly wheels increasingly are being used for energy storage and peak power delivery 
we believe ultracapacitors will become a component of choice for energy storage and peak power delivery because ultracapacitors have significant performance advantages over batteries  including delivery of up to times the instantaneous power  lower weight for storage of comparable electrical energy  deeper discharge and faster recharge  more reliable operation in extreme temperatures degrees c to degrees c  require little or no maintenance  have minimal environmental issues associated with disposal  and can operate reliably for the life of any application 
we believe that ultracapacitors and other energy storage peak power delivery devices are enabling and emerging and potentially enormous market for energy storage peak power delivery separate from energy generation devices 
as a result  we believe that electrical systems in the future  whether in a digital camera or in a hybrid internal combustion electric vehicle  increasingly will be designed to separate and optimize energy generation and energy storage peak power delivery 
any application that requires the storage of electrical energy and the discharge of highly variable amounts of power is a potential market for ultracapacitors and other energy storage and power delivery components 
we expect that components designed to meet these power delivery requirements will capture an increasing share of the energy storage market that we believe currently is addressable with ultracapacitors  which is estimated to be approximately million per annum 
we believe that the addressable market has the opportunity to grow in the future to multi billions of dollars per annum as new electrical system designs are developed and commercialized 
maxwell is a global leader in commercializing ultracapacitor technology 
ultracapacitors are ideally suited for applications that require highly efficient energy storage and repeated bursts of electric power lasting from fractions of a second up to several minutes 
with no moving parts  ultracapacitors provide a simple  solid state  highly reliable solution to buffer short term mismatches between power available and power required 
unlike batteries  capacitors can be recharged from any electrical energy source as quickly as they are discharged  and they operate reliably through hundreds of thousands of discharge recharge cycles with minimal degradation of performance 
traditional capacitors discharge power too rapidly to be suitable for many power delivery applications 
ultracapacitors have greater energy storage capability than traditional capacitors and can discharge power over time periods ranging from fractions of a second to several minutes 
used in tandem with batteries  ultracapacitors can provide bursts of power to meet power demand peaks  enhance performance and significantly extend battery life 
where alternative sources of recharge energy are available  ultracapacitors can replace batteries entirely 
our boostcap ultracapacitors provide dynamic range and peak power for applications that require periodic bursts of power  whether for an internal combustion electric hybrid drive train or a battery pack for consumer or industrial electronic devices 
ultracapacitors can be linked together in modules and charged from any primary energy source  such as a battery  engine  fuel cell or electrical outlet  and deliver high power on demand 
virtually any device with peak power demands greater than its average power requirement is a candidate for our ultracapacitors as part of its energy storage and power delivery system 
we offer our proprietary boostcap ultracapacitors in several form factors  ranging from five farad postage stamp size small cells to cylindrical  farad large cells that are approximately two inches in diameter and six inches long 
we are able to supply these cells in volumes and at price points that are opening numerous market opportunities for energy storage and peak power delivery 
our small cell ultracapacitors have been designed into consumer electronics such as digital cameras  industrial electronics such as actuators  remote transmitting devices  bar code scanners  computer memory boards and transportation applications such as electric rail alarm systems and electric actuators  or latches  for aircraft and automobile doors 
many of the end products into which our small cell ultracapacitors have been designed now are beginning commercial production 
our large cell ultracapacitors have been designed into industrial applications such as uninterruptible back up power systems and transportation applications such as hybrid buses and trucks  electric rail systems and capacitive starting systems for diesel engines 
these design ins are in the prototyping and evaluation phase and not yet in commercial production 
the charts below describe the current primary applications for maxwell s boostcap ultracapacitors that either are in commercial production or in the prototyping and evaluation phase 
farad to farad small cell ultracapacitors market application stage of commercialization consumer electronics digital cameras battery enhancement and peak power supply beginning commercial production industrial electronics bar code scanners utility meters actuators iv pumps memory boards energy storage  back up power and peak power supply beginning commercial production energy generation windmill power generators energy storage and peak power supply beginning commercial production for windmill applications stationary fuel cell systems energy storage and peak power supply stationary fuel cell applications are in the prototyping and evaluation phase transportation helicopter airbags emergency lighting airplane door actuators pilot transponders automobile door actuators energy storage  back up power and peak power supply beginning commercial production  except automobile door actuators which are in the prototyping and evaluation phase our small cell ultracapacitors have entered commercial production 
this means that our customers have begun commercial production of the end products into which our ultracapacitors have been designed and they require production quantities of ultracapacitors from our factory 
we expect to be our first year of production of multi millions of small cell ultracapacitors 
and farad large cell ultracapacitors market application stage of commercialization industrial telecommunications uninterruptible power supply systems backup power for uninterruptible power supply systems for telecommunication base stations and automated industrial factories prototyping and evaluation of rack mount modules developed by maxwell energy storage and peak power supply for automated industrial equipment prototyping and evaluation of modules developed by maxwell transportation rail systems recapture of braking energy and initial acceleration for electric trains 
same for roller coasters and other theme park rides 
prototyping and evaluation of in station and on board modules developed by third party system integrators capacitive starting systems for diesel locomotives prototyping and evaluation of capacitive starting subsystems developed by third party integrators bus and truck systems recapture of braking energy and initial acceleration for diesel electric hybrid drive trains 
same for fuel cell drive trains 
prototyping and evaluation of buses and trucks developed by third party integrators capacitive starting systems for diesel engines prototyping and evaluation of capacitive starting subsystems developed by third party integrators all electric short haul buses  fork lifts  vans and other high stop start vehicles prototyping and evaluation of vehicles developed by third party integrators automobile systems and volts recapture of braking energy initial acceleration for internal combustion electric hybrid drive trains 
same for fuel cell drive trains 
electric power steering and electric braking prototyping and evaluation of modules developed by maxwell and by third party integrators and of electrical subsystems developed by third party integrators our large cell ultracapacitors have been designed into larger integrated prototype systems that are being evaluated by potential end customers 
we expect to bring increased sampling and prototyping activity with certain applications moving into commercial production in we are preparing maxwell to be positioned to produce multi millions of large cell ultracapacitors beginning in to facilitate adoption of ultracapacitors for applications such as bus  truck and auto power trains  electric rail systems  uninterruptible power supplies and fuel cells  which require integrated packs consisting of multiple ultracapacitor cells  we are complementing our internal capabilities with those of third parties who possess the systems integration and power and thermal management capabilities to provide fully integrated power packs to satisfy the energy storage and power delivery demands of these larger systems 
high voltage capacitors electric utility grids have switches  circuit breakers  step down transformers and measurement instruments responsible for the transport  distribution and measurement of high voltage electricity 
these systems need to be protected from high voltage arcing  which predominately is achieved through the use of high voltage capacitors 
the current market for high voltage grading and coupling capacitors  capacitor voltage dividers and other special high voltage capacitors is estimated to be approximately million per year 
maxwell  through its acquisition of montena components  is a leader in the design and production of high voltage capacitors  with more than twenty years of experience in the industry 
engineers who have specific expertise in high voltage systems develop and test our capacitors in our high voltage laboratory in rossens  switzerland 
our capacitors are produced through a proprietary automated winding and assembly process to ensure their consistent quality and high reliability performance 
power systems products high reliability power distribution and power conditioning systems are required to provide a clean and consistent flow of electric power to sensitive medical imaging systems and automated manufacturing equipment 
we engineer and manufacture such systems  enabling our oem customers to focus their efforts on overall design and integration of the larger systems they supply to their end customers 
such power solutions frequently require customization 
also  as time to market is critical for many such applications  rapid design and production capabilities are required of suppliers providing these systems 
therefore  the proliferation of complex electronic systems with specific power distribution and power conditioning requirements has created attractive markets for specialized power product manufacturers who possess the engineering and manufacturing know how and experience to provide design intensive  custom solutions 
the current market for three phase uninterruptible power supplies  or ups  and power distribution and power conditioning products for our target market of five kilovolts and lower  is estimated to be approximately billion 
at present  many of our power distribution and power conditioning products are based on our customers designs 
we are developing improved power systems products based on our own designs that intend to improve performance and reliability  and to reduce cost for our customers while also permitting us to expand sales and improve product line gross margins 
for example  we have developed  and plan to introduce in  solid state energy storage systems incorporating our boostcap ultracapacitors to replace batteries for short term back up power in ups systems 
unlike batteries  ultracapacitors require no maintenance 
also  because ultracapacitors recharge in seconds  as compared to batteries  which require hours to recharge  ultracapacitors provide more reliable back up power in the event of multiple power interruptions over a short time period  such as hours or within a day 
radiation shielded microelectronics manufacturers of commercial and military satellites and other spacecraft require on board microelectronics that meet specific functional requirements  and that will not fail when they are exposure to anticipated levels of radiation 
in the past  microelectronics for these special applications have used radiation hardened silicon 
the supply of radiation hardened silicon is diminishing because there are fewer fabricators of specialty silicon 
as a result  demand for commercial off the shelf silicon  protected in radiation shielded packages  is growing 
radiation shielded commercial silicon also provides higher functionality and costs significantly less than radiation hardened silicon 
the ability to provide radiation shielded silicon requires expertise in power electronics  circuit design  silicon selection  radiation shielding and high quality assurance testing 
current worldwide sales of radiation shielded microelectronics for the satellite market are estimated at more than million annually 
we design  manufacture and market radiation shielded microelectronics  including power modules  memory modules and single board computers  for the aerospace and military markets 
we design customized microelectronics together with highly adaptable  proprietary  packaging and shielding and other radiation mitigation techniques to allow oems to use powerful  low cost  commercial off the shelf components protected with the level of radiation shielding required for reliable performance in the environment in which they are to be deployed 
winding equipment manufacturers of capacitors and lithium batteries require high speed coil winding machines to assemble their products 
manufacturers of high quality metalized film capacitors and of lithium primary batteries require highly reliable winding machines capable of high speed  high quality and high yield production of the components 
the current market for winding machines for these applications is estimated to be approximately million per year 
maxwell  through its acquisition of montena components  is a leader in the design and production of precision automated winding machines for metalized film capacitors and lithium batteries  with more than twenty years of experience in the industry 
we have engineers with specific expertise in the design and construction of winding machines that reliably can produce high quality components with high speed and very high yield throughput 
we focus on customer applications that require precise production of components with strict product specifications 
our winding equipment not only is capable of producing precise components  but also is designed for high yields and long operating lifetimes 
manufacturing with the acquisition of montena components  and the divestitures of our non core computing and glass to metal seals businesses in  we have consolidated manufacturing for our power components and systems and microelectronic products into the company s principal production facilities located in san diego  california  and rossens  switzerland 
over the past three years  we have made substantial capital investments to build and outfit state of the art production facilities  including advanced information technology infrastructure  and have implemented new manufacturing and business processes and systems to increase our production capacity and improve efficiency and product quality 
our production facilities have been designed with flexible overhead power grids and modular manufacturing cells and equipment that allow factory operations to be reconfigured rapidly at minimal expense 
we believe that our manufacturing facilities and resources give us sufficient capacity to meet near term demand for all of our products 
ultracapacitors our objective with all of our boostcap ultracapacitor products is to be a highly reliable  multi location  global supplier of these products for customer applications that require high power density in small packages for energy storage and power delivery 
in february  we formed an ultracapacitor manufacturing and marketing alliance in china with yeong long technologies co  ltd  a million per annum manufacturer of electrolytic capacitors  to commercialize our proprietary boostcap ultracapacitors in china and to position us as a global supplier of ultracapacitors with production facilities in the us  europe and china 
we have installed an automated assembly line at our san diego production facility to make our small cell ultracapacitors 
this automated line can produce approximately  to  small cells per day with very high yields by industry standards 
we produce our large cell ultracapacitors on pilot production lines in our san diego and rossens production facilities 
we are designing our large cells to incorporate lower cost materials and facilitate future high speed automated manufacturing 
in addition to significantly reducing material cost  the new design will reduce the number of components required to make a finished cell and reduces the number of manufacturing process steps to a fraction of those required for previous designs 
high voltage capacitors we produce our high voltage grading and coupling capacitors at our rossens production facility 
we are the only producer that manufactures high voltage capacitors with automated winding and assembly processes 
this gives us ample capacity to satisfy customer demand and to produce consistent  high quality and highly reliable products 
power systems products we assemble and test our power distribution and power conditioning units and solid state energy storage systems in our san diego production facility 
we rely on third party suppliers for fabrication and assembly of printed circuit boards  sheet metal enclosures and major subassemblies 
radiation shielded microelectronics we produce our microelectronics products at our san diego facility 
we have reengineered our production processes for radiation shielded microelectronics  resulting in dramatic improvement in cycle time required to produce and test microelectronics and a significant increase in yield of components that comply with customer required quality and performance standards 
we believe that we now have ample capacity and top tier manufacturing capabilities for highly reliable  radiation shielded power modules  memory modules and single board computers for the aerospace and military markets 
winding equipment at our facility in switzerland  we produce high speed coil winding equipment that is used to assemble metalized film capacitors and lithium batteries 
we have ample capacity to satisfy customer demand 
we intend in the future to outsource more of the subassemblies that comprise the equipment that we sell and to focus more of our efforts on design and final integration  calibration and test 
suppliers we generally purchase components and materials  such as electronic components  dielectric materials and enclosures of metal and plastic  from a number of suppliers 
for certain products  we rely on a limited number of suppliers or a single supplier 
although we believe there are alternative sources for components and materials currently obtained from a single source  there can be no assurance that we will be able to identify and qualify alternative suppliers in a timely manner 
we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers 
marketing and sales across all our product lines  we market and sell components and systems for integration by oems into larger systems and other end products through both direct and indirect sales organizations in north america  europe and asia 
because the introduction of emerging technologies requires customer acceptance of new and different technical approaches  and because many of our oem customers have rigorous vendor qualification processes  the initial sale for our products can take weeks or months 
our principal marketing strategy is to cultivate long term customer relationships by becoming a preferred supplier with an opportunity to compete for multiple supply agreements and follow on contracts with our key oem customers 
as these design in sales tend to be technical and engineering intensive  we organize customer specific teams composed of sales  engineering  research and development and other technical personnel to work closely with our customers across multiple disciplines to satisfy their requirements for form  fit  function  environment and mechanics 
as time to market often is the primary consideration in our customers decisions to outsource components or systems and in their selection of a vendor  the initial sale and design in process frequently evolves into ongoing account management to ensure on time delivery and responsive technical support and problem solving 
our business units conduct marketing programs intended to position and promote their products  including trade shows  seminars  advertising  public relations  distribution of product literature and websites on the internet 
we employ marketing communications specialists to develop and implement our marketing programs  design and develop marketing materials  negotiate advertising media purchases  write and place product news releases and manage our marketing websites 
competition each of our business operations has competitors  many of whom have longer operating histories  significantly greater financial  technical  marketing and other resources  greater name recognition  and a larger installed base of customers 
in some of the target markets for our emerging technologies  we face competition from products utilizing alternative technologies 
ultracapacitors although a number of companies are developing capacitor technology  we have two principal competitors in ultracapacitor or supercapacitor products panasonic  a division of matsushita electric industries  ltd  and epcos ag 
the key competitive factors are price  performance energy stored and power delivered per unit volume  form factor  operational lifetime and breadth of product offerings 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to these competitive factors 
ultracapacitors also compete with other technologies  including high power batteries in power quality and peak power applications  and with flywheels and batteries in back up energy storage applications 
high voltage capacitors our principal competitors in the high voltage capacitor markets are in house production groups of certain of our customers and other independent manufacturers such as the coil product division of trench limited in canada and europe and hochspannungsger te porz gmbh in germany 
we believe that we compete favorably with respect to being a consistent  reliable supplier of highly reliable high voltage capacitors  and with respect to our expertise in high voltage systems 
power systems products the markets for our power distribution and power conditioning products are highly fragmented  with no single dominant participant 
in the medical and industrial markets in which our product offerings are concentrated  we compete with several participants  including liebert corporation  online power  inc  teal electronics corporation and controlled power corporation 
we believe that we compete favorably in these markets on price  quality and functionality 
radiation shielded microelectronics our radiation shielded power modules  memory modules and single board computers compete with the products of traditional radiation hardened integrated circuit suppliers such as honeywell corporation  lockheed martin corporation and bae systems 
we also have competition from commercial suppliers with product lines that have favorable radiation tolerance characteristics  such as temic instruments bv in europe and national semiconductor and analog devices inc our proprietary radiation shielding technology enables us to provide flexible  low cost radiation protection solutions utilizing the most advanced commercial off the shelf electronic circuits and processors 
in that market segment  we compete with high reliability packaging houses such as austin semiconductor  inc  white microelectronics  inc and teledyne microelectronics  a unit of teledyne technologies  inc for monolithic and multichip modules 
winding equipment our principal competitors in winding machines for metalized film capacitors and lithium batteries are asian designers and manufacturers 
we believe that we compete favorably in the segment of the market that requires precision machines that produce consistent  high quality components with high throughput and very high yields 
research and development we maintain active research and development programs to improve existing products and to develop new products 
for the year ended december   research and development expenditures totaled approximately million  compared with million and  million in the fiscal years ended december  and december   respectively 
in general  our product development focuses on designing and producing products that will not fail for the life of the system or end product into which they are integrated  enhancing the performance of existing products and developing new  technologically advanced products  developing new products to meet identified market opportunities  and making our products more compact and less expensive to manufacture to meet the performance  form factor and pricing demands of our customers 
most of the current research  development and engineering activity for our high reliability products is focused on material sciences  including electrically conducting and dielectric materials  ceramics and radiation tolerant silicon and ceramic composites  to improve performance  reliability  ease of manufacture and cost 
efforts also are focused on product design for high volume manufacturing and on manufacturing engineering and manufacturing processes 
the principal focus of our ultracapacitor development activities is to increase power density and delivery and to dramatically reduce cost 
our ultracapacitor designs focus on low cost  high capacity devices in standard sizes ranging from five farad to farad cells 
our goal is to penetrate cost sensitive applications at very high volumes millions of cells per year beginning in for small cells and in for large cells 
the principal focus of our high voltage capacitor development efforts is to reduce the weight and size of the capacitors while improving high voltage performance characteristics 
we also are directing our design efforts to develop high voltage capacitors for additional applications 
the principal focus of our microelectronics product development activities is on circuit design  shielding and other radiation mitigation techniques that allow the use of powerful  off the shelf commercial silicon components in aerospace and military applications where ultra high reliability is an absolute requirement 
our power systems design and development efforts have been concentrated on integrating our ultracapacitor technology into an innovative energy storage module to provide a more reliable  compact  lower maintenance alternative to batteries for short term backup power in uninterruptible power supplies 
the principal focus of our winding machine development efforts is to address particular customer needs based on their capacitor or lithium battery design specifications 
we also look to standardize machine platforms and subassemblies to reduce our production costs and lead times 
intellectual property as our businesses expand  we are placing increased emphasis on patents to provide protection for certain key technologies and products 
our success will depend in part on our ability to maintain our patents  add to them where appropriate  and to develop new products and applications without infringing the patent and other proprietary rights of third parties 
as of december   we held issued patents and pending patent applications in the united states relating to our high reliability power and microelectronic products 
we routinely secure patents in the united states and corresponding foreign patents in principal countries of europe and asia 
at present  we do not rely on licenses from any third parties to produce or commercialize our products 
we have patent portfolios covering the technologies associated with our power and microelectronic products 
these patents and patent applications primarily relate to  the electrode design and cell packaging techniques we use to produce our boostcap ultracapacitors  our power conditioning products and ultracapacitor based solid state energy storage products  and the designs for our microelectronics  including technology to protect our microelectronics from radiation 
our high voltage capacitor products and our winding machines are based on our know how and trade secrets rather than on patents 
in the future we intend to pursue patent protection in these product areas in addition to continued trade secret protection of certain aspects of the products and their production 
establishing and maintaining proprietary products and technologies is a key element of our success 
although we attempt to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trade secrets and other measures  there can be no assurance that these steps will be adequate to prevent misappropriation by third parties  or will be adequate under the laws of some foreign countries  which may not protect our proprietary rights to the same extent as do the laws of the united states 
we use employee and third party confidentiality and nondisclosure agreements to protect our trade secrets and unpatented know how 
we require each of our employees to enter into a proprietary rights and nondisclosure agreement in which the employee agrees to maintain the confidentiality of all proprietary company information and  subject to certain exceptions  to assign to the company all rights in any proprietary information or technology made or contributed by the employee during his or her employment 
in addition  we regularly enter into nondisclosure agreements with third parties  such as potential product development partners and customers 
backlog our backlog for continuing operations as of december  and amounted to approximately million  and million  respectively 
backlog consists of firm orders for products not yet delivered 
we expect to deliver substantially all of our current backlog within months 
government regulation the testing  sale and application of our power products require compliance and certification with a number of us and foreign standards for electromechanical systems  such as underwriters laboratories ul  canadian standards association csa and committee european ce 
we incorporate compliance with such standards into the quality assurance protocols in building and testing our and power products 
because of the nature of our operations and the use of hazardous substances in some of our ongoing manufacturing and research and development activities  we are subject to stringent federal  state and local laws  rules  regulations and policies governing the use  generation  manufacturing  storage  air emission  effluent discharge  handling and disposal of certain materials and wastes 
foreign sales our revenue from customers outside of the united states was million  million and million in the years ended december   and  respectively 
significant customers sales to general electric medical systems gems amounted to approximately of revenues for maxwell high reliability segment and of our total revenue for maxwell does not have a formal contract with gems 
sales to gems are made on purchase orders issued month by month and are comprised of several different products sold to two different modality groups which  in effect  are different customers within gems 
in general maxwell sells low margin build to print products to gems  which gems has decided to source beginning in from gems affiliates or other companies located in lower cost countries 
as a result  we expect to record significantly lower future sales to gems 
employees at december   we had full time employees  including in our high reliability power and microelectronic products segment  in our winding equipment segment and on our corporate staff 
none of our employees is represented by a labor union 
we consider our relations with our employees to be good 
discontinued operations purepulse technologies in september  our purepulse subsidiary suspended operations 
purepulse had been designing and developing systems that generate extremely intense  broad spectrum  pulsed light to purify water and inactivate viruses and other pathogens that contaminate vaccines and products sourced from human or animal tissues  such as plasma derivatives  transfusion blood components and biopharmaceuticals 
although purepulse attracted million of equity capital from millipore corporation in march  the venture capital and other equity markets deteriorated after that time  and purepulse was not able to raise additional capital to fund its operations 
in december  we identified purepulse as not being part of the company s strategic focus for the future and adopted a plan to sell all or a part of purepulse by the end of however  due to poor market conditions  we were unable to secure a transaction under acceptable terms 
the purepulse segment was classified as a discontinued operation for financial reporting purposes in  and had been carried as such through and the first three quarters of in december  purepulse licensed its purebright technology to culligan international company for certain water purification applications  and in april  it entered into an alliance with millipore to develop and commercialize purebright in flow systems in exchange for future royalties to purepulse 
we plan to monitor these ongoing relationships  and purepulse will preserve its intellectual property and technology for a possible future sale 
risk factors an investment in our common stock involves a high degree of risk 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be seriously harmed if any of the following risks occur 
in any such case  the market price of our common stock could decline and you may lose all or part of the money you paid to buy our common stock 
the risks and uncertainties described below are not the only ones we face 
additional risks and uncertainties  including those not presently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial  may also result in decreased revenues  increased expenses or other events which could result in a decline in the price of our common stock 
we may not be able to develop or market commercial products successfully  and thus may not be able to achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
historically  we have relied in part upon government contracts to fund our research and development  and we have derived a significant portion of our revenues from the government sector 
in march  we sold our defense contracting business  and we now generate revenue solely from developing  manufacturing and marketing commercial products  many of which have been developed since if we are unable to continue to develop or to market commercial products successfully  we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future 
we have recently introduced many of our products into commercial markets and  upon such introductions  we also must introduce our capabilities as a reliable supplier of these products 
some of our products are alternatives to established products or provide capabilities that do not presently exist in the marketplace 
our products are sold in highly competitive and rapidly changing markets 
the success of our products is significantly affected by their cost  technology standards and end user preferences 
in addition  the success of our products depends on a number of factors  including our ability to maintain an engineering and marketing staff sufficiently skilled to identify and design new products  overcome technical  financial and other risks involved in introducing new products and technologies  identify and develop a market for our new products and technologies and accurately anticipate demand  develop appropriate commercial sales and distribution channels  develop and manufacture new products at competitive prices  deliver products that meet our customers requirements for quality and reliability  increase our manufacturing capacity and improve manufacturing efficiency  respond to technological changes by improving our existing products and technologies  demonstrate that our products have technological and or economic advantages over the products of our competitors  and respond to competitors that are more experienced  have significantly greater resources  and have a larger base of customers 
we may experience difficulty manufacturing our products  which would prevent us from achieving increased sales and market share 
we may experience difficulty in manufacturing our products in increased quantities  outsourcing the manufacturing of our products and improving our manufacturing processes 
if we are unable to manufacture our products in increased quantities  or if we are unable to outsource the manufacture of our products or improve our manufacturing processes  we may be unable to increase sales and market share for our products 
we have limited experience in manufacturing our products in high volume 
it may be difficult for us to achieve the following results increase the quantity of the new products we manufacture  especially those products that contain new technologies  reduce our manufacturing costs to a level needed to produce adequate profit margins  and design and procure automated manufacturing equipment 
it may also be difficult for us to solve management  technological  engineering and other problems related to our manufacturing processes 
these problems include production volumes and yields  quality assurance  adequate and timely supply of materials and shortages of qualified management and other personnel 
in addition  we may elect to have some of our products manufactured by third parties 
if we outsource the manufacture of our products  we will face risks with respect to quality assurance  cost and the absence of close engineering support 
our large cell ultracapacitors designed for automotive and transportation applications may not gain widespread commercial acceptance 
we have designed our large cell ultracapacitor products primarily for use in automotive and transportation applications 
currently  most of the major automotive companies are pursuing initiatives to develop alternative power sources for cars and trucks and to replace the traditional volt electrical system with a volt system 
we believe our ultracapacitor provides an innovative  alternative power solution for both of these applications and are currently in discussions with several major automotive companies and their suppliers with regard to designing our ultracapacitor into their future products 
however  there are other competing technologies such as nickel metal hydride batteries  combustion engines using alternative fuels and competing ultracapacitors 
we believe that the long term success of our ultracapacitors will be determined by our ability to outperform the competing technologies and to have our ultracapacitors widely designed into the next generation of the power drive trains in hybrid powered cars and trucks and the first generation of volt electrical systems 
if our ultracapacitors fail to achieve widespread commercial acceptance in this next generation of automotive products  our revenues and growth opportunities will be adversely impacted in future periods and our overall business prospects will be significantly impaired 
we may be unable to produce our large cell ultracapacitors in commercial quantities or reduce the cost of production enough to be commercially viable for widespread application 
if we are not able to produce large quantities of our large cell ultracapacitors in the near future at a dramatically reduced per unit cost  our large cell ultracapacitors may not be a commercially viable alternative to traditional or other alternative energy storage and power delivery devices 
although we have already begun selling a new type of boostcap large cell ultracapacitor designed for automotive and transportation applications  we have only produced this ultracapacitor in limited quantities and at a relatively high cost as compared with traditional energy storage and power delivery devices 
we are currently investing significant resources in improving the cell design for higher performance at lower cost and in automating and scaling up our manufacturing capacity to permit us to produce this product in commercial quantities sufficient to meet the needs of our potential customers 
furthermore  we believe based on discussions with potential customers in the automotive and transportation industry that our ultracapacitors will not provide a commercially viable solution for our customers needs unless we are able to reduce the per unit cost dramatically below our current per unit cost 
if we are not successful in the near future to reduce our cost of production and to establish the capability to produce large quantities of ultracapacitors  we may not be able to generate commercial acceptance of  and sufficient revenue from  this product to recapture our significant investment in the development and manufacturing scale up of this product and our overall business prospects will be significantly impaired 
we have a history of losses and we may not achieve or maintain profitability in the future  which may decrease the market value of our stock 
we have incurred net losses in our last three fiscal years 
in the future  we may experience significant fluctuations in our revenues and we may incur net losses from period to period as a result of a number of factors  including the following the amounts invested in developing and marketing our products in any period as compared to the volume of sales of those products in the same period  fluctuations in demand for our products by oems  the prices at which we sell our products and services as compared to the prices of our competitors  the timing of our product introductions as compared to those of our competitors  the profit margins on our mix of product sales  and the dilution  debt  expenses  and or charges we incur as part of acquisitions we have made or may make 
in addition  we incur significant costs developing and marketing products based on new technologies  and  in order to increase our market share  we may sell our products at profit margins below those we ultimately expect to achieve and or significantly reduce the prices of our products and services in a particular quarter or quarters 
the impact of the foregoing may cause our operating results to be below the expectations of public market analysts and investors  which may decrease the market value of our stock 
if our oem customers fail to sell a sufficient quantity of products incorporating our components  or if the oem s sales timing and volume fluctuates  it would prevent us from achieving increased sales and market share 
sales to a relatively small number of oems  as opposed to direct retail sales to customers  make up a significant percentage of our revenues 
for example  sales to general electric medical systems  or gems  accounted for approximately of our total revenues for the fiscal year ended december  we do not have a formal contract with gems 
sales to gems are made on purchase orders issued on a monthly basis 
in general maxwell sells low margin build to print products to gems  which gems has decided to source beginning in from gems affiliates or other companies located in lower cost countries 
as a result  we expect to record significantly lower future sales to gems 
our ability to make sales to oem customers depends on our ability to compete effectively primarily on price  delivery and quality and the success of gems products and programs that use our products 
the timing and volume of these sales depend upon the sales levels and shipping schedules for the products of our oem customers 
thus  even if we develop a successful component  our sales will not increase unless the product into which our component is incorporated is successful 
if our oem customers fail to sell a sufficient quantity of products incorporating our components  or if the oem s sales timing and volume fluctuates  it could prevent us from achieving sales 
our oem customers typically require a long development and engineering process before incorporating our products and services into their systems and products 
this period of time is in addition to the time we spend on basic research and product development 
as a result  we are vulnerable to changes in technology or end user preferences 
our opportunity to sell our products to our oem customers typically occurs at infrequent intervals  depending on when the oem customer designs a new product or enhances an existing one 
if we are not aware of an oem s product development schedule  or if we cannot provide components or technologies when they develop their products  we may miss an opportunity that may not reappear for some time 
continued poor economic conditions in the united states and abroad may adversely affect our oem customers and prevent us from achieving sales and profit growth 
many of our new products are components designed for new products and systems to be introduced to the marketplace by our oem customers 
poor economic conditions in have slowed the introduction of new products by our oem customers and continued poor economic conditions may adversely affect our ability to market and sell our new products based on new technologies 
our ability to increase market share and sales depends on our ability to hire and train marketing and sales personnel successfully 
because many of our products are new  we have limited experience marketing and selling them 
to sell our products  our marketing and sales personnel must demonstrate effectively the advantages of our products over the products offered by our competitors  in addition  we must be able to demonstrate the value of new technology in order to sell new products to existing or new customers 
the highly technical nature of the products we offer requires that we retain and attract adequate marketing and sales personnel  and we may have difficulty doing that in a highly competitive employment market 
also  as part of our sales and marketing strategy  we enter into arrangements with distributors and sales representatives and depend upon their efforts to sell our products 
our arrangements with outside distributors and sales representatives may not be successful 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately  we could lose our competitive advantage in the industry segments in which we do business 
our success depends on establishing and maintaining our intellectual property rights 
if we are unable to protect our intellectual property adequately  we could lose our competitive advantage in the industry segments in which we do business 
although we try to protect our intellectual property rights through patents  trademarks  copyrights  trade secrets and other measures  these steps may not prevent misappropriation by third parties 
we have taken steps to protect our intellectual property rights under the laws of certain foreign countries  but our efforts may not be effective to the extent that foreign laws are not as protective as united states laws 
in addition  we face the possibility that third parties might reverse engineer our products to discover how they work and introduce competing products 
as our business has expanded  we have emphasized protecting our technologies and products through patents 
our success depends on maintaining our patents  adding to them where appropriate  and developing products and applications without infringing the patent and proprietary rights of others 
the following risks are involved in protecting our patents our patents may be circumvented or challenged and held unenforceable or invalid  our pending or future patent applications  if any  may not be issued in a timely manner and may not provide the protections we seek  and others may claim rights in the patented and other proprietary technology that we own or license 
if our patents are invalidated or if it is determined that we  or the licensor of the patent  does not hold sole rights to the patent  we could lose our competitive advantage in the industry segments in which we do business 
competing research and patent activity in our product areas is substantial 
conflicting patent and other proprietary rights claims may result in disputes or litigation 
although we do not believe that our products or proprietary rights infringe third party rights  infringement claims could be asserted against us in the future 
also  we may not be able to stop a third party product from infringing our proprietary rights without litigation 
if we are subject to such claims  or if we are forced to bring such claims  we could endure time consuming  costly litigation resulting in product shipment delays and possible damage payments or injunctions that could prevent us from making  using or selling the infringing product 
we may also be required to enter into royalty or licensing agreements as part of a judgment or settlement which could have a negative impact on the amount of revenue derived from our products or proprietary rights 
we face risks associated with the marketing  distribution and sale of our products internationally  and if we are unable to manage these risks effectively  it could impair our ability to grow our business abroad 
we derive a significant portion of our revenues from sales to customers located outside the united states 
we expect our international sales to continue to represent a significant and increasing portion of our future revenues 
as a result  our business will continue to be subject to certain risks  such as foreign government regulations  export controls  changes in tax laws  tax treaties  tariffs and freight rates 
if we are unable to manage these risks effectively  it could impair our ability to grow our business abroad 
we have recently acquired operations in switzerland 
since we are relatively inexperienced in managing our international operations  we may be unable to focus on the operation and expansion of our worldwide business and to manage cultural  language and legal differences inherent in international operations 
in addition  to the extent we are unable to respond to political  economic and other conditions in these countries effectively  our business  results of operations and financial condition could be materially adversely affected 
moreover  changes in the mix of income from our foreign subsidiaries  expiration of tax holidays and changes in tax laws and regulations could increase our tax rates 
as a result of our international operations  the united states dollar amount of our revenue and expenses is impacted by changes in foreign currency exchange rates 
if we are unable to retain key personnel  we could lose our technological and competitive advantage in some product areas and business segments 
since we primarily focus on emerging technologies  our success depends upon the continued service of our key technical and senior management personnel 
some of our engineers are the key developers of our products and technologies and are recognized as leaders in their area of expertise 
the loss of such engineers to our competitors could threaten our technological and competitive advantage in some product areas and business segments 
our performance also depends on our ability to identify  hire  train  retain and motivate high quality personnel  especially key operations executives and highly skilled engineers 
the industries in which we compete are characterized by a high level of employee mobility and aggressive recruiting of skilled personnel 
our employees may terminate their employment with us at any time 
if we are unable to secure qualified and adequate sources for our materials  components and sub assemblies we may not be able to make our products at competitive costs and we may have difficulty meeting customer demand  which could damage our relationships with our customers 
our ability to manufacture products depends in part on our ability to secure qualified and adequate sources of materials  components and sub assemblies at prices that enable us to make our products at competitive costs 
some of our suppliers are currently the sole source of one or more items that we need to manufacture our products 
although we seek to reduce our dependence on sole and limited source suppliers  the partial or complete loss of these sources could have at least a temporary material effect on our business and results of operations  and damage customer relationships 
on occasion  we have experienced difficulty in obtaining timely delivery of supplies from outside suppliers 
this has adversely impacted our delivery time to our customers and there can be no assurance that such supply problems will not recur 
we may not be able to obtain sufficient capital to expand our business  which could require us to change our business strategy and result in decreased profitability and cause a loss of customers 
we believe that in the future we will need a substantial amount of capital for a number of purposes including the following to meet anticipated volume production requirements for several of our product lines  in particular our ultracapacitors  which require high speed automated production lines to achieve targeted customer volume and price requirements  to expand our manufacturing capabilities and establish viable production alternatives  to fund our continuing expansion into commercial markets  to achieve our long term strategic objectives  to maintain and enhance our competitive position  and to acquire new or complementary businesses  product lines and technologies 
there can be no assurance that the necessary additional financing will be available to us on acceptable terms or at all 
if adequate funds are not available  we may be required to change or delay our planned product commercialization strategy or our anticipated facilities expenditures  which could result in decreased profitability and cause a loss of customers 
anti takeover provisions in our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could prevent transactions that are in the best interest of our stockholders 
some provisions in our certificate of incorporation could make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of maxwell  even if such change in control would be beneficial to our stockholders 
we have a staggered board of directors  which means that our directors are divided into three classes 
the directors in each class are elected to serve three year terms 
since the three year terms of each class overlap the terms of the other classes of directors  the entire board of directors cannot be replaced in any one year 
furthermore  our certificate of incorporation contains a fair price provision which may require a potential acquirer to obtain the consent of our board to any business combination involving maxwell 
our certificate of incorporation and bylaws do not permit stockholder action by written consent or the calling by stockholders of a special meeting 
we have adopted a program under which our stockholders have rights to purchase our stock directly from us at a below market price if a company or person attempts to buy us without negotiating with the board 
this program is intended to encourage a buyer to negotiate with us  but may have the effect of discouraging offers from possible buyers 
the provisions of our certificate of incorporation and bylaws could delay  deter or prevent a merger  tender offer  or other business combination or change in control involving us that some  or a majority  of our stockholders might consider to be in their best interests 
this includes offers or attempted takeovers that could result in our stockholders receiving a premium over the market price for their shares of our common stock 
our common stock experiences limited trading volume and our stock price has been volatile 
our common stock is traded on the nasdaq national market 
the trading volume of our common stock each day is relatively low 
this means that sales or purchases of relatively small blocks of stock can have a significant impact on the price at which our stock is traded 
we believe that factors such as quarterly fluctuations in financial results  announcements of new technologies impacting our products  announcements by competitors or changes in securities analysts recommendations could cause the price of our stock to fluctuate substantially 
these fluctuations  as well as general economic conditions such as recessions or higher interest rates  may adversely affect the market price of our common stock

this conversion involved the hiring of new personnel  restructure and divestiture of businesses  building and outfitting new factories and the development and introduction of new products 
beginning at the end of and continuing in  our target telecommunications markets for our i bus computing systems business and our microelectronics business collapsed 
during this same timeframe  we experienced a longer cycle than we had expected in getting our ultracapacitors designed into end products and having the end products go into commercial production 
these negative market forces impacted us at the same time that we were completing the rebuild and conversion of the company as a product driven commercial enterprise 
the result was that our cost structure and production capacity was well in excess of our immediate revenue opportunities 
we responded by tightly focusing our strategy and product lines around high reliability products 
in the second half of  we initiated a series of steps to intensify the focus on our strategy and to exit non strategic businesses in july  we acquired montena components  a swiss manufacturer and marketer of ultracapacitors  high voltage capacitors and battery and capacitor winding equipment 
this acquisition brought to maxwell additional power business focused on high reliability components and additional design and production capabilities that enhance maxwell s profile as a reliable  global supplier 
montena components is located in rossens  switzerland  near major automotive and industrial development and manufacturing centers in germany  france and italy 
in september  we suspended the operations of our purepulse technologies subsidiary  which had been developing pulsed light purification systems 
we are preserving purepulse s intellectual property for a possible future sale 
in september  we sold the computing systems business of our i bus phoenix subsidiary 
although that business had a strategic focus on high reliability high availability computer servers  the markets for such systems  particularly telecommunications  had deteriorated so dramatically that we concluded that near term growth prospects for our computing systems business were limited 
in september  we sold our non core teknaseal glass to metal seals business for cash 
also  in december  we sold a small power factor correction product line that did not fit our high reliability strategy 
during the third quarter of  we began integrating the power systems business of i bus phoenix into our electronic components group 
our current power systems products address the high reliability and power quality requirements of our medical imaging and industrial automation systems oem customers 
new power system products scheduled for introduction in incorporate our ultracapacitor and other proprietary power electronics technologies to address high reliability back up power applications in the industrial market 
in early  we completed the integration and relocation of our power systems business into our principal manufacturing facility in san diego  california  and vacated and listed for sale the company owned facility that formerly housed the north american operations of i bus phoenix 
this consolidation allows more efficient use of our remaining facilities and personnel  and the sale of the vacated facility will provide the company with additional cash resources 
also in early  we formed an ultracapacitor manufacturing and marketing alliance in china with yeong long technologies co  ltd  a million per annum manufacturer of electrolytic capacitors  to commercialize our proprietary boostcap ultracapacitors in china and to position us as a global supplier of ultracapacitors with production facilities in the us  europe and china 
with the completion of these actions  virtually all of maxwell s revenue now is derived from the sale of power and microelectronic products and winding equipment  and the company s internal operations are concentrated in two primary facilities  one in san diego  california  and the other in rossens  switzerland 
business segments after the acquisition of montena components and the dispositions of our i bus computing systems business and teknaseal glass to metal seals business  which were completed during the third and fourth quarters of  the company s businesses were organized into two segments  the high reliability segment and the winding equipment segment 
the high reliability segment contains our high reliability power and microelectronic products  which currently include ultracapacitors for electrical energy storage and delivery of peak power for a variety of applications high voltage grading and coupling capacitors used in electric utility infrastructure  high voltage laboratories and other applications involving transport  distribution and measurement of high voltage electrical energy power distribution and conditioning modules for integration into larger medical imaging and other industrial systems for delivery of consistent high quality power radiation shielded microelectronics  including power modules  memory modules and single board computers for aerospace and military applications the winding equipment segment makes winding machines and automated assembly lines used to manufacture metalized film capacitors and lithium batteries 
prior to the sale of its computing systems business at the end of the third quarter of  the company s i bus phoenix power and computing systems segment designed  manufactured and marketed applied computing systems and power distribution and power conditioning systems mainly to oems serving the telecommunications  industrial automation  broadcasting and medical imaging markets 
the power distribution and conditioning systems now are part of our high reliability segment 
the restated i bus computing systems segment consists only of the computing business  which was sold in september in june  the company sold substantially all of the assets except for accounts receivable  liabilities and business operations of its sierra kd components business in carson city  nevada sierra 
sierra manufactured and commercialized ceramic filter capacitors with wire feedthroughs for implantable medical devices and ceramic capacitors for aerospace and commercial applications 
on september   the company sold its non core teknaseal glass to metal seals business in minneapolis  minnesota 
both of these businesses  which were previously reported as part of the former electronic components segment  have been classified into a segment for reporting purposes called the sierra and teknaseal segment 
results of operations sales our consolidated sales for were million  a decrease of million  or  from sharp declines in the sale of telecommunications equipment and continued weakness in the satellite and other industrial markets served by the company negatively impacted reported results 
sales increased from the acquisition of montena components in july of  contributing approximately million of revenue for the remainder of  and decreased due primarily to the impact on our sales from the declines in the markets mentioned above and to the divestitures of i bus computing systems and teknaseal in september excluding the acquisition and the divestitures  our sales decreased million or compared to the same lines of business in primarily due to a decrease in sales of power products in the medical imaging market 
in  our consolidated sales were million  down million  or  from i bus computing systems sales declined million  or due to the conclusion of its computer supply contract with siemens electrocom and weakness in other industrial and telecommunications markets 
sales declined million due to the divestiture of sierra in june excluding sales by i bus computing systems and sierra  our sales increased million  or  due primarily to strong demand in for our power systems in the medical imaging market 
segment sales vs 
maxwell high reliability for the year ended december   sales increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the acquisition of montena components in july  which contributed an million increase  and modest increases in microelectronics and boostcap ultracapacitors were offset by a decrease in sales of power products in the medical imaging market 
outlook for we expect year to year revenue growth in compared with  led by significant growth in ultracapacitor revenues 
increased ultracapacitor revenues will be partially offset by an expected decline in revenues from our other high reliability products 
we expect a decline in power systems revenue as we transition our product mix to high margin proprietary designs and away from low margin build to print systems 
we supply most of our low margin build to print power system products to ge medical systems  who has decided to source these products from affiliates or other companies located in low cost countries 
as a result  we expect to record significantly lower future sales to ge medical systems 
revenues from our high voltage capacitors and our microelectronics are expected to decline in compared to because of anticipated weakness in the utility infrastructure and  separately  the satellite industries 
winding equipment for the six month period from our purchase of montena in july and ending december   sales were million 
outlook for we believe that  when compared to annualized revenues  revenues will grow due to expected increased demand for winding machines used to produce metalized thin film capacitors and lithium batteries 
i bus computing systems for the year ended december   sales decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  we sold i bus computing systems in september the computing systems business was focused on high reliability  high availability computers and the markets for such systems  particularly telecommunications  deteriorated dramatically during the year  which negatively impacted results of operations 
sierra and teknaseal for the year ended december   sales decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  due primarily to the sale of sierra in june and the teknaseal business in september segment sales vs 
maxwell high reliability for the year ended december   sales increased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  power product sales increased million  mainly in the medical imaging market  but were offset by decreases in microelectronics and ultracapacitors due to a decline in the commercial satellite market  primarily related to the deterioration in telecommunications and delays in the adoption of ultracapacitors in automotive and consumer electronics markets 
i bus computing systems for the year ended december   sales decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  the decreases were due primarily to the conclusion of a computer supply contract with siemens electrocom and weakness in other industrial and telecommunications markets 
sierra and teknaseal for the year ended december   sales decreased million  or  to million from million for the year ended december  due primarily to the sale of sierra in june although revenues at teknaseal increased million  this increase was more than offset by reduced revenue as a result of the sale of sierra in june total costs and expenses cost of sales was million in  a decrease of from in  cost of sales was million  compared with million in cost of sales as a percent of net sales was  and in  and  respectively 
gross profit margins have been negatively impacted by the downturn in the general economy and  in particular  the telecommunications equipment  satellite and other industrial markets served by the company 
this resulted in inventory charges for excess and obsolete inventory and under utilized production facilities 
outlook for during the second half of  we significantly reduced our fixed production costs primarily through consolidating us production into one facility in san diego 
we have also reallocated resources to improve quality  cycle times  yields and reduce material costs 
we expect gross margins to improve quarter over quarter in as a result of these initiatives and improved revenue mix 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses were million in  a decrease of from in  sg a was million  compared with million in sg a as a percent of net sales was  and in  and  respectively 
although we have dramatically reduced sg a costs and improved efficiencies in response to market conditions  sg a as a percent of sales has increased because of lower product revenues 
research and development r d expenses were million in  a decrease of  which is mainly attributable to reductions in  and the sale of  i bus computing systems 
in  r d was million  compared with million in r d as a percent of net sales was  and in  and  respectively 
outlook for sg a plus r d totaled approximately million during the just completed fourth quarter of although we will increase r d funding for our boostcap ultracapacitors and new products  such as our energy storage modules that contain boostcap ultracapacitors  we expect total spending for sg a and r d on a quarterly basis to be comparable to our fourth quarter acquisitions  divestitures  restructuring and other in july  we acquired montena components  a provider of ultracapacitors and high voltage capacitors to oem customers and automated winding equipment used to produce capacitors and lithium batteries  for million in cash and million common shares of maxwell 
this acquisition brought additional high reliability power business focused on ultracapacitors and high voltage capacitors and additional design and production capabilities that enhance our profile as a reliable  global supplier 
net gain loss on sale of businesses  were million in and million in in september  we sold the i bus computing systems business for million in debt and certain other consideration 
in order to position the business for sale  we incurred million in restructuring charges related mainly to severance 
we also incurred million in charges related to goodwill impairment and other asset write downs related to that business 
the loss on the disposition totaled million as we fully reserved for the note due to risks of collectability 
in september  we also sold our non core teknaseal glass to metal seals business for million in cash  of which million is held in an escrow account that is expected to be released to the company ratably over the next four calendar quarters 
approximately million of the million proceeds is payable to certain former employees of teknaseal 
we recorded a net gain of million in the fourth quarter of and expect to record additional gains as funds are released to us from escrow 
in june  we sold the sierra business for million in cash 
the company retained accounts receivable as of the acquisition date  which amounted to million 
we recorded a net pre tax gain of million in restructuring charges were million in and million in in  the restructuring charges related mainly to restructuring i bus computing systems and our actions to position that business for sale 
in the first half of  i bus phoenix introduced new applied computing products that had been developed in however  the market for applied computing products  particularly in telecommunications  deteriorated throughout the company responded to the poor market conditions for computing systems and other capital goods by restructuring i bus phoenix 
in june  the company began implementing the restructuring plan and recorded restructuring charges of million 
in addition  the company also determined that certain components in inventory had been adversely impacted 
accordingly  the company recorded an inventory charge of million for certain excess and obsolete raw material components and finished goods 
this charge is included in cost of sales 
during the third fiscal quarter of  the company decided to sell the applied computing business of i bus phoenix to a new company organized by former i bus phoenix senior managers 
in preparation for the sale and to configure the i bus phoenix computing business to be self supporting  i bus phoenix consolidated all production of the applied computing products to its facility in tangmere  united kingdom  and reduced worldwide personnel 
as a result of this plan  the company recorded additional restructuring charges of million during the quarter ended september the unpaid restructuring balance of million at december  is expected to be paid during the first quarter of during and the company had undertaken various actions to consolidate its facilities and reduce its cost structure 
as a result  the company recorded restructuring million in charges in the year ended december  these charges include severance costs related to a reduction in workforce  which impacted all segments and classes of employees  and the closure and combination of certain facilities 
amortization of goodwill was million and million in and respectively 
in connection with the adoption of fas  the amortization of goodwill was discontinued beginning with fiscal fixed asset impairments were million in and million in impairment charges recorded in are related to fixed assets associated with the i bus computing systems business that were abandoned and computers and computer systems infrastructure directly related to supporting i bus computing systems business 
the impairment also includes fixed assets associated with transformer and harness production for the power systems group 
production of transformers and harnesses has been outsourced 
impairment charges recorded in are related to the write off of leasehold improvements and other fixed assets that were abandoned due to the consolidation of factories 
goodwill impairments were million in and million in impairment charges recorded in are related to disposition of the i bus computing systems business 
goodwill impairment charges recorded in are related to goodwill originally recorded in conjunction with the acquisition of phoenix power 
maxwell technologies acquired phoenix power in march for million 
the terms of the agreement provided for additional contingent purchase price based upon the financial performance of phoenix power following the acquisition through february  in january  the company paid additional consideration of million  which was recorded as additional goodwill 
this additional consideration was based on a projection made by the company in december that phoenix power would provide at lease million in adjusted pre tax income for the month period ended february subsequent reviews of actual results revealed that the adjusted pre tax income was closer to million  which was below the threshold for any additional consideration per the acquisition agreement 
however  the agreement did not provide for a return of the additional consideration 
based on these facts and revised lower full year projections  we requested and received a third party appraisal  which determined that an impairment existed and  accordingly  the company reduced the goodwill by million 
investment impairment of million recorded in relates to maxwell s ownership of approximately of a privately held company involved in support services in the areas of information technology  system and software integration and engineering and technical services under contract with various government agencies 
upon review of its annual financial statements and discussions with its cfo  we were informed that the company had a negative net worth and had decided to restructure its operations to discontinue its information technology and software integration and engineering businesses and focus only on government contracting 
based on these facts and the uncertainty surrounding its ability to return to profitability  we concluded that the investment was impaired and we fully reserved for the investment 
amortizations of other intangibles was million in and relates to the amortization of customer backlog acquired in conjunction with the acquisition of montena components and the amortization of ultracapacitor intellectual property that was recorded in conjunction with the merger of the electronic components group  a majority owned subsidiary  into maxwell through the purchase of shares not owned by the company 
in conjunction with i bus computing system s acquisition of gateworks corporation in  we recorded a charge of million for the write off of in process technology 
minority interest in net loss of subsidiaries was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
during the first quarter of  the company acquired all of the outstanding minority interests  including stock options  of its majority owned subsidiaries  except for purepulse technologies see discontinued operations below  in exchange for shares and options in maxwell 
interest income expense  net was  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the company used proceeds from the sale of businesses to pay down debt and the excess was invested in high quality short term marketable investments 
income loss from continuing operations before taxes income loss from continuing operations before taxes was million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for comparative purposes  the following discussion of segment earnings losses exclude restructuring charges  other deductions  net and gain loss on sale of businesses 
maxwell high reliability losses were million in compared to million in the change was due to an improved product mix and significant cost reductions 
the acquisition of montena components contributed million to the year to year change 
in the loss increased by million to million from million in the increase was due to unfavorable product mix as high margin sales of microelectronic products decreased and low margin  build to print power systems recorded a significant increase 
outlook for we expect to achieve full year profitability for this segment due to the full year impact of the acquisition of montena components  the consolidation of factories in san diego and expected growth in our boostcap ultracapacitor revenues 
the winding equipment segment  which was part of our acquisition of montena components  is expected to produce full year positive earnings 
i bus computing systems  which was disposed of in september  recorded losses of million for the nine month period compared to million for the full year and million for this business was significantly impacted by the economic downturn in general and the deterioration in the telecommunications sector 
existing oem contracts that started to expire in and early were not replaced 
uncertainty as to future prospects led to the decision to sell this business 
sierra and teknaseal  which were sold in june and september  respectively  generated combined earnings of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
these component businesses  although profitable  served niche markets with limited growth potential 
our assessment was that we could maximize value to maxwell through a sale rather than through continuing their operations 
provision credit for income taxes for the year ended december  our tax credit of million included a foreign expense of million 
the tax provision recorded by montena components was offset by a refund of us taxes paid in of million 
the valuation allowance increased by million 
we had net deferred tax assets before our valuation allowance of approximately million at december   which relate primarily to net operating loss carryforwards and tax credits 
the tax provision reflects a reduction in deferred tax assets used to offset taxable income and an increase in the valuation allowance of million to fully reserve for our deferred tax assets 
during the fourth quarter of a valuation allowance of million was recorded to fully reserve cumulative deferred tax assets recorded through december  the valuation allowance was established as realizability of the deferred tax assets was no longer assessed by management as being more likely than not 
the credit for income taxes for the year ended december  reflected our expected world wide tax rate for that year 
the effective tax rate was reduced by the fact that no tax credit was provided for the million charge recorded to reduce the carrying value of goodwill since that amount will never be deductible for tax purposes 
discontinued operations discontinued operations are comprised of our government systems and purepulse subsidiaries  as well as certain other smaller businesses divested in in connection with the company s decision in to focus the future of the company on the electronic components group and i bus phoenix  the company sold its high voltage wound film capacitors and high voltage power supplies business and its time card and job cost accounting software business 
in addition  the company offered for sale its defense contracting business and decided to seek strategic alternatives for its purepulse technologies  inc subsidiary 
accordingly  both the defense contracting business and purepulse  each of which was previously classified as a separate segment  and the high voltage wound film capacitors and high voltage power supplies business and its time card and job cost accounting software business  have been classified as discontinued operations for financial reporting purposes 
the loss from discontinued operations was million in the year ended december   compared with a loss of million for the year ended december  and  for the year ended december  in september  our purepulse subsidiary suspended operations and we recorded non cash charges of approximately million and cash charges of approximately million for severance and other charges 
purepulse had been designing and developing systems that generate extremely intense  broad spectrum  pulsed light to purify water and inactivate viruses and other pathogens that contaminate vaccines and products sourced from human or animal tissues  such as plasma derivatives  transfusion blood components and biopharmaceuticals 
although purepulse attracted million of equity capital from millipore and maxwell in march  the venture capital and other equity markets deteriorated since that time and purepulse was not able to raise additional capital to fund its operations 
the loss from discontinued operations was million in the year ended december   compared to a loss of  for the year ended december  in march  we sold the government systems division for cash and recorded a gain of million  net of million provision mainly related to ongoing lease obligations 
as of december   remaining lease obligations  which expire in april  were million and the related provision was million 
loss from operations of these discontinued businesses was million in the year ended december   compared to million for the year ended december  included in the loss for is a charge to the tax provision of million for recording a valuation allowance 
in february  we sold the high voltage wound film capacitors and high voltage power supplies businesses for cash of million  approximately the book value of the net assets sold as of that date 
in addition  the buyer assumed certain liabilities of the businesses  including a long term lease for the facility the businesses occupied  which extended through with annual rent of approximately million 
in november  we sold our time card and job cost accounting software business for cash of million and shares of common stock of the buyer with an immaterial value 
in the fourth quarter of  we also received cash of approximately million related to our equity investment in an unconsolidated entity  which was classified as a discontinued operation 
liquidity and capital resources cash used by operating activities in the year ended december   was approximately million  as compared to million in the year ended december in  the use of cash primarily was attributable to operating losses  including restructuring related cash expenses for our continuing operations  which for most of included i bus computing systems 
cash used in discontinued operations  which included purepulse and residual leases and other obligations of divested businesses  in the year ended december  was million  as compared to million in the year ended december  capital expenditures for the years ended december  and were million and million  respectively 
cash of million was used in the company s third fiscal quarter as part of the purchase price for montena components 
capital expenditures for is not expected to exceed million  which is approximately equal to our annual depreciation and amortization charges 
during and  the company financed operating losses with term debt  as described under the heading new bank credit agreement below  and the sale of non strategic businesses 
in the year ended december   we received million and million of cash in connection with  respectively  the sale of our sierra and government systems businesses 
these funds were used to pay down debt of million and to fund continuing and discontinued operations 
on the first day of our fourth fiscal quarter of  we sold teknaseal for approximately million net cash to maxwell  of which million is held in an escrow account and will be paid upon teknaseal achieving certain revenue benchmarks in we used a portion of these proceeds to prepay million of our bank term loan  which reduced the outstanding term loan to million 
maxwell technologies  sa requires advances from customers for certain product lines and issues bank guarantees that give the customer the right to receive back the advance if the product is not delivered by a specific date 
as of the end of december we had issued guarantees of million related to these product arrangements  most of which we expect to ship to customers in the first quarter of during the quarter ended september  we suspended the operations of purepulse  sold i bus computing systems and started consolidating our power systems business and corporate headquarters into our leased facility in san diego  which contains our ultracapacitor and microelectronic high reliability business 
we also decided to offer for sale our  sq ft owned facility that housed i bus computing systems north american operations and administration 
these actions  combined with the acquisition of montena  are consistent with our strategy to focus on high value  high reliability power and microelectronic products and to structure the company s operations to be self supporting on product revenues in the near future 
at present  we expect that future cash flows from operations combined with our existing cash balance  will be adequate to fund our capital equipment and working capital requirements and operating losses for more than the next twelve months 
we also expect within the next twelve months to complete the sale of our owned facility in san diego  which we expect will add significantly to our cash reserves 
although we believe we have adequate cash on hand and future cash flows to meet our cash requirements  a decrease in revenues would cause continued losses and negative cash flows from operations 
therefore  the company may need to seek additional financing in the future 
although we cannot predict with any certainty as to if or when we might need additional financing  we believe such financing would not be required for the next twelve months 
if the company needs additional financing  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
in addition  if the company does not generate sufficient cash flow from operations in line with its current forecasts  the company may have to initiate measures to raise cash through asset sales  additional debt or equity issuances and or curtail operations 
failure to achieve expected cash flows or  if necessary  to obtain additional debt or equity investments would have a material adverse effect on the company

minority equity interests in subsidiaries and subsidiary option programs in january  we adopted a plan to complete merger transactions between maxwell and our electronic components group subsidiary and our i bus phoenix subsidiary whereby all of the minority shareholdings and options in such subsidiaries would be converted to shares and options of maxwell 
on april   these merger transactions resulted in the issuance of  common shares of maxwell and options to purchase  common shares of maxwell 
in february  pacificorp energy ventures  inc  the largest minority shareholder in the electronic components group  exchanged its preferred shares of the electronic components group for  common shares of maxwell pursuant to its right under the original investment agreement 
purepulse  which is classified as discontinued operations  has minority equity investors 
these investors are former strategic partners  former employees who were issued shares when purepulse originally was incorporated and former employees who have exercised stock options in that entity 
as of december  minority investors owned approximately of the outstanding stock of purepulse 
critical accounting policies the consolidated financial statements are prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the us  which requires the company to make estimates and assumptions 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment and complexity and  as such  management assumptions and conclusions in these areas may significantly impact the results of operations of the company 
revenue recognition for the current year  substantially all of our revenue is derived from the sale of manufactured products directly to customers 
in general  revenue is recognized at the time the product is shipped unless specific terms require otherwise 
in general  we do not offer discounts and there is no right of return 
however in prior years certain continuing and discontinued segments recorded revenue from both long term and short term fixed price contracts and cost plus contracts with the us government directly or through a prime contractor 
those revenues  including estimated profits  were recognized as costs were incurred and included provisions for any anticipated losses 
these contracts are subject to rate audits and other audits  which could result in additional losses in excess of estimated provisions 
accounts receivable we establish and maintain customer credit limits based on credit checks  analyses of credit worthiness and payment history 
accounts receivable consist primarily of amounts due to us from our normal business activities 
we maintain an allowance for doubtful accounts to reflect the expected bad debts based on past collection history and specific risks identified in the portfolio 
excess and obsolete inventory we value inventories at the lower of cost or market 
in assessing the ultimate realization of inventories  we make judgments as to future demand requirements and compare that with current and committed inventory levels 
the markets for the company s products are extremely competitive and are characterized by rapid technological change  new product development  product obsolescence and evolving industry standards 
in addition price competition is intense and significant price erosion generally occurs over the life of a product 
we have recorded significant charges for reserves in recent periods due to changes in market conditions 
it is possible that changes in reserves may be required due to changing market conditions  or that judgments as to ultimate realization may be incorrect 
assets held for sale and remaining lease obligations the building formerly occupied by i bus phoenix  inc  which is classified as held for sale  is carried at historical cost 
the company believes that  based on analysis prepared by the listing agent  the fair value is in excess of the carrying value 
changes in market conditions or other factors may ultimately result in realizing less than the carrying value 
also  the company has estimated the remaining liability associated with remaining lease obligations recorded in discontinued operations see discussion of discontinued operations 
in making these estimates  we assessed commercial real estate markets and made estimates as to how and when we will be able to either sub lease  terminate or buy out our remaining lease obligations 
commercial real estate markets have been depressed due to poor economic conditions and spending reductions by businesses and government agencies and there can be no guarantee that we will be able to conclude these lease obligations for the amounts that we have accrued 
loss in the sale of the i bus computing systems business the company fully reserved for the million note received in exchange for the i bus computing systems business due to the uncertainty as to its collectability 
future collections would result in recognizing gains 
long lived assets and goodwill long lived assets such as property  plant and equipment and other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events and changes in business circumstances indicate the carrying value of the long lived asset may not be recoverable 
if the company determines that the carrying value of the long lived asset may not be recoverable  a permanent impairment charge is recorded for the amount by which the carrying value of the long lived asset exceeds its fair value 
management believes that the estimates of fair value are reasonable  however changes in business circumstances or estimates of cash flows and fair value could materially impact reported results 
in assessing the recoverability of goodwill  which is completed annually  we make assumptions regarding future cash flows and other factors to determine the fair value 
in addition  we periodically have independent appraisals of the business segments performed and compare the fair value to the carrying value 
if these estimates or their related assumptions change in the future  we may be required to record impairment charges 
goodwill associated with the i bus computing systems was written off in conjunction with the disposition of that business 
the remaining goodwill is mainly attributable to the acquisition of montena components  which was completed in july our analysis  which was completed early in the fourth quarter of  was based on the determination that circumstances since the recently completed acquisition of montena had not materially changed and the company s fair value at that date was significantly in excess of the carrying value of its assets including goodwill 
valuation allowance for deferred tax assets a valuation allowance is provided for deferred tax assets if it is more likely than not that these items will either expire before the company is able to realize their benefit  or that future deductibility is uncertain 
in general  companies that have had a recent history of operating losses are faced with a difficult burden of proof on their ability to generate sufficient future income within the next two years in order to realize the benefit of the deferred tax assets 
in  the company determined that it was appropriate to record a valuation allowance which continued in against its deferred tax assets based on its recent history of losses 
the deferred tax assets are still available for the company to use in the future to offset taxable income  which would result in the recognition of a tax benefit and a reduction to the company s effective tax rate 
inflation and changes in prices generally  we have been able to increase prices to offset inflation related cost increases in our continuing operations

item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we have not entered into or invested in any instruments that are subject to market risk  except as follows we face exposure to financial market risks  including adverse movements in foreign currency exchange rates and changes in interest rates 
these exposures may change over time and could have a material adverse impact on our financial results 
our primary foreign currency exposure is related to our subsidiary in switzerland 
maxwell  sa has euro and local currency swiss franc revenue and local currency operating expenses 
changes in these currency exchange rates impact the us dollar amount of revenue and expenses 
we do not hedge our currency exposures 
at december   we had million outstanding related to variable rate u 
s dollar denominated term debt 
the carrying value of these short term borrowings approximates fair value due to the short maturities of these instruments 
assuming a hypothetical adverse change in the interest rate  annual interest expense on our short term borrowings  if the amount outstanding remained unchanged  would increase by approximately million 
we invest excess cash in debt instruments of the us government and its agencies  high quality corporate issuers and money market accounts 
the primary objective of our investment activities is to preserve principal while maximizing yields without significantly increasing risk 
current policies do not allow the use of interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a third party manages approximately million of the investment portfolio under guidelines approved by the company s board of directors 
the balance of our cash is invested in money market accounts with banks
