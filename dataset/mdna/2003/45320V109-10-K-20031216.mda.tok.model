item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies the accounting policies described below are those the company considers critical in preparing its consolidated financial statements 
these policies require the application of significant judgement by management in selecting the appropriate assumptions for calculating financial estimates 
by their nature  these judgements are subject to an inherent degree of uncertainty 
these judgements are based on historical experience  the company s observation of trends in the industry  information provided by customers and information available from other outside sources  as appropriate and available at the time the estimates are made 
however  as described below  these estimates could change materially if different information or assumptions were used 
the company believes that of its significant accounting policies  the following may involve a higher degree of judgment or estimation than other accounting policies 
accounts receivable doubtful accounts reserves the company provides for losses on accounts receivable based upon their current status  historical experience and management s evaluation of existing economic conditions 
significant changes in customer profitability or general economic conditions may have a significant effect on the company s allowance for doubtful accounts

tst is reasonably assured a majority of the sales are collectible upon shipment due to its credit policies and collection methods 
for those accounts tst is not reasonably assured of collection the company reserves against doubtful accounts based upon historical experience and management s evaluation of existing economic conditions

substantially all of the slow moving products can be repackaged into different formats or labels 
demand for products that are associated with obsolete technology slowly decline as sales of new hardware requiring new or different consumables increase 
the reduced demand for products which are becoming obsolete is easily monitored and scheduled production of these items is adjusted accordingly

the company records reductions in revenue when products are returned 
returns and allowances are monitored based on a historical percentage of sales 
all returns must be approved by the company prior to the product being returned  and in some instances a restocking fee is charged to the customer 
the company also monitors reasons for return  such as quality  shipping errors or ordering errors 
commissions and rebates the company reserves commissions and rebates paid to certain customers based on specific contractual agreements

on april   we executed a one year  million construction loan with the current mortgagee of the itasca  illinois building to expand the building an additional  square feet 
we believe that the funds available under the loans encumbering our california  texas  pennsylvania  illinois and west virginia plants  the construction loan for the expansion at the itasca facility  the revolving credit facility  cash and cash equivalents  trade credit and internally generated funds will be sufficient to satisfy our requirements for working capital and capital expenditures for at least the next twelve months 
such belief is based on certain assumptions  including the continuation of current operations and no extraordinary adverse events  and there can be no assurance that such assumptions are correct 
in addition  expansion of our operations due to an increased demand for products tst manufactures or significant growth of hotsheet 
com  inc may require us to obtain additional capital to add new operations or manufacturing facilities 
if that should occur  we anticipate that the funds required would be generated through securities offerings or additional debt 
there can be no assurance that any additional financing will be available if needed  or  if available  will be on acceptable terms

 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities did not have a material impact on our financial position or results of operations 
subsequent events in september  the company implemented numerous cost savings measures such as an approximate reduction in our workforce and reduction of various benefits

the landlord of the building is renovating the project and we expect to fully occupy the facility in january in addition  we are expanding our itasca  illinois plant by  square feet  and intend to exit our leased building in elk grove  illinois  consolidating it in itasca

table of contents impact of inflation inflation is not expected to have a significant impact on our business 
forward looking statements management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and the results of operations and other sections of this form k contain forward looking statements about our prospects for the future  including but not limited to our ability to generate sufficient working capital  our ability to continue to maintain sales to justify capital expenses  and our ability to generate additional sales to meet business expansion 
such statements are subject to certain risks and uncertainties which could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected  including availability of raw materials  availability of thermal facsimile  computer  laser and color ink jet paper  to the cyclical nature of the industry in which we operate  the potential of technological changes which would adversely affect the need for our products  price fluctuations which could adversely impact the large inventory we require  loss of any significant customer  and termination of contracts essential to our business 
parties are cautioned not to rely on any such forward looking statements or judgments in making investment decisions 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are not exposed to market risks such as foreign currency exchange rates  but are exposed to risks such as variable interest rates 
market risk is the potential loss arising from adverse changes in market prices and rates 
our subsidiaries do not have supply contracts with any of their foreign vendors 
all foreign vendors are paid in united states currency 
in addition  tst s international sales of finished goods is insignificant 
accordingly  there are not sufficient factors to create a material foreign exchange rate risk  therefore  we do not use exchange commitments to minimize the negative impact of foreign currency fluctuations 
we had both fixed rate and variable rate debts as of august  the fair market value of long term variable interest rate debt is subject to interest rate risk 
generally the fair market value of variable interest rate debt will decrease as interest rates fall and increase as interest rates rise 
the estimated fair value of our total long term fixed rate and floating rate debt approximates carrying value 
see note to consolidated financial statements 
based upon our market risk sensitive debt outstanding at august   there was no material exposure to our financial position or results of operations
