overview the company s results of operations for fiscal have been adversely affected by the continuing economic slowdown and the uncertain geopolitical environment 
these effects relate to all segments of the company s business  including the company s domestic and german operations 
in addition  the company s furniture operations have been negatively impacted by the increased competition from lower cost imports  particularly from the far east  and primarily from china 
as a consequence  in part  of the continued economic slowdown  the company has announced a restructuring of some of its operations to reduce costs and streamline its operations 
on february   the company approved plans to restructure certain of its operations 
in conjunction with such plans the company will close its st 
paul  virginia manufacturing facility and relocate certain operations to other plants  close three of its retail outlet stores and utilize third party liquidators to expedite the sale of excess inventory which will create space in the company s erie  pennsylvania facility to launch new production strategies  and terminate production and management level employees in various locations 
the company expects to incur losses in the range of approximately to million associated with implementing these plans during in addition  the company has recently amended its revolving credit facility  as discussed below  to modify some of the financial covenants and ratios required 
further  the amendment prohibits the company from paying any cash dividends on its capital stock and requires the company  among other things  to place a mortgage on certain of its real property in favor of its lenders 
the outstanding principal amount of the loan  plus accrued interest  is due under the revolving credit facility  absent any extension or further amendment  in june the company is exploring various alternatives with respect to such debt obligation  the ultimate outcome of which no assurance can be given 
the company s net sales declined approximately in fiscal year from the company s fiscal year and from the company s fiscal year 
the company believes that the following factors will continue to impact the company s results of operations and financial condition any slowdown of consumer spending in north america and europe  particularly in superstores  any stalling of growth in sales of personal computers  which reduces the need for computer desks and workcenters  inventory reductions by the company s customers  particularly at office superstores  competition from imports using alternative materials  including metal and glass  and competition from imported assembled furniture  consolidation and or liquidation of furniture retailers  the uncertain international political climate  and changing consumer demand and or changing technologies resulting in the obsolescence of certain products 
the company operates its business in four reportable segments bush business furniture  which concentrates on the business office and the home office markets with sales to the office superstore and dealer channels  bush furniture  which focuses on home entertainment  home office and other home furnishings products  bush furniture europe  which sells commercial  home office and other furnishings in the european market  and bush technologies  which is focused on the cell phone accessories after market  as well as the utilization of surface technologies in automotive interiors  cosmetics  sporting goods and consumer electronics 
the company operates several manufacturing and warehouse facilities throughout north america and in germany 
on june   the company acquired a interest in the rohr gruppe  a german furniture manufacturer  which name was subsequently changed to rohr bush gmbh co 
rohr bush 
on february   the company executed a definitive agreement with certain members of the rohr family to acquire the family s approximately remaining interest in rohr bush 
this transaction closed in october results of operations the following table shows the approximate percentage of certain items included in the consolidated statements of earnings relative to net sales for the fiscal years indicated percentage of net sales net sales cost of sales gross profit selling  general and administrative expenses gain on sale of assets operating income interest expense earnings before income taxes and cumulative effect of accounting change income taxes earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change cumulative effect of accounting change net loss earnings the following paragraphs provide an analysis of the changes in net sales  selected cost and expense items  and net earnings for fiscal years through results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the company s net sales for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year decreased  or approximately  to  the sales decrease primarily reflects decreases in bush furniture  bush technologies and bush furniture europe  partially offset by an increase in bush business furniture 
the current economic slowdown in both north america and germany continues to create a challenging environment in which to grow sales and exerts a downward pressure on prices 
in addition  competition from imports using alternative materials  including metal and glass  are pressuring the low end of the product mix at bush business furniture  primarily at the office superstores 
the company believes imports of rta furniture are up from approximately in to approximately of the market today 
the company s cost of sales were  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year  or a decrease of  this decrease is primarily the result of a  pre tax  non cash inventory write down that was incurred in the fourth quarter of fiscal year the cost of sales as an approximate percentage of net sales decreased by percentage points from in to in without the  inventory write down  the cost of sales as an approximate percentage of net sales was in fiscal year the percentage point increase to in fiscal year primarily reflects the impact of lower gross margins in the bush technologies segment resulting from competitive market pressures 
as a result of such competitive market pressures and lower gross margins  bush technologies incurred a loss before income taxes of  in fiscal year  as compared to earnings before income taxes of  in fiscal year in addition  due to the continued economic softness in europe  particularly in germany  bush furniture europe incurred a loss before income taxes of  in fiscal year  as compared to a loss before income taxes of  in fiscal year for fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses were virtually unchanged from fiscal year  decreasing by  selling  general and administrative expenses increased as an approximate percentage of net sales from in to in fiscal year  primarily as a result of selling  general and administrative expenses not decreasing proportionally as much as the sales decrease 
interest expense decreased to  in fiscal year or approximately of net sales from  in fiscal year or approximately of net sales 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to a reduction in the company s long term debt 
the company s overall effective federal  state and local tax rate decreased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the decrease is primarily due to a lower overall effective state tax rate attributable to the greater impact in of the bush technologies segment income on the state tax rate and the reduced impact related to non deductible goodwill no longer required to be amortized in under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas no 
for fiscal year  the company generated earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change of  or 
basic and diluted earnings per share  as compared to  or basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year had the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
been applied in fiscal year  earnings before cumulative effect of accounting change would have been  or basic and diluted earnings per share 
pursuant to sfas no 
 goodwill is no longer being amortized and must be periodically tested for impairment 
upon adoption of sfas no 
 the company concluded that goodwill related to the bush furniture europe segment was impaired 
as a result  effective december  the first day of fiscal year  the company has recorded a non cash charge for goodwill impairment of  as a cumulative effect of accounting change or basic and diluted loss per share 
net loss for fiscal year was  or basic and diluted loss per share  as compared to net earnings of  or basic and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year had the non amortization provisions of sfas no 
been applied in fiscal year  net earnings would have been  or basic and diluted earnings per share 
results of operations fiscal compared to fiscal the company s net sales for the fiscal year compared to the fiscal year decreased  or approximately  to  the sales decrease primarily reflects a decrease in orders from the company s north american furniture customers due to the economic slowdown 
sales were also negatively impacted by the inventory rationalization programs undertaken at the office superstores in the second quarter of fiscal year and by customer delays in new product launches at bush technologies 
the company s cost of sales were  in fiscal year compared to  in fiscal year  or a decrease of  this decrease primarily reflects the lower sales levels as compared to the prior year 
the cost of sales as an approximate percentage of net sales increased by percentage points from in to in the increase in cost of sales as a percentage of net sales primarily reflects lower absorption of manufacturing overhead as a result of decreased production volumes  both as the result of the decreased sales levels and the reduction of finished goods inventory levels  and as a result of a  pre tax  non cash inventory write down in the fourth quarter of fiscal year for fiscal year  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased by  compared to fiscal year the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily the result of a reduction in various selling expenses such as commissions  marketing and promotional incentives 
these reductions were a result of both the company s lower sales volumes and as a result of a change in sales terms with two customers 
this change  in which various marketing and promotional incentives were replaced with a reduction in sales prices to the two customers  had no impact on net earnings  but resulted in a decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses and a corresponding decrease in net sales 
since this change occurred in mid fiscal year  it impacted the second half of such year and all of fiscal year selling  general and administrative expenses increased as an approximate percentage of net sales from in fiscal year to in fiscal year interest expense decreased to  in fiscal year or approximately of net sales from  in fiscal year or approximately of net sales 
the decrease in interest expense was primarily due to decreases in the interest rates paid on the company s revolving credit facility 
the company s overall effective federal  state and local tax rate increased from in fiscal year to in fiscal year the increase was primarily due to the effects of permanent non deductible items such as certain travel and entertainment expenses and the amortization of certain goodwill costs  fixed taxes such as delaware franchise taxes and a change in the mix of the allocation of income for state income tax purposes 
the impact of these items was exaggerated by the lower level of earnings before income taxes upon which the effective tax rates are computed 
for fiscal year  the company generated net earnings after taxes of  or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share  as compared to  or basic earnings per share and diluted earnings per share for fiscal year liquidity and capital resources working capital at fiscal year end decreased  over fiscal year end  primarily as a result of an increase in accounts payable 
the increase in accounts payables reflects actions taken to reduce working capital requirements 
total assets at fiscal year end decreased  over fiscal year end  primarily as a result of a decrease in property  plant and equipment which reflects capital expenditures that are less than the level of depreciation 
total liabilities at fiscal year end decreased by  as compared to fiscal year end such decrease in total liabilities was due primarily to a decrease in long term debt  partially offset by an increase in accounts payable and deferred income taxes 
net cash provided by operating activities for the fiscal year ended december  was  resulting primarily from an increase in current liabilities  mostly accounts payable  and depreciation  amortization including the accounting charge for goodwill  and deferred taxes  partially offset by the net loss 
during fiscal year  the company expended  on capital expenditures versus  in the previous fiscal year 
capital expenditures for are currently forecasted to be approximately to million 
other assets increased  in fiscal year  primarily as a result of an increase in the cash surrender value of insurance policies and costs associated with amending the company s credit agreement 
in fiscal year  the company received  from the exercise of stock options by employees  received a tax benefit of  from the exercise of such options and paid four quarterly dividends totaling  to its stockholders 
the cash dividend for each of the quarters in was per share 
cash flows provided by operating activities in excess of other cash flow requirements were primarily used to pay down  principal amount of long term debt 
the company has a revolving credit facility  initially dated as of june  and as amended  with jpmorgan chase bank and other lending institutions 
in the first quarter of fiscal year the company entered into a seventh amendment  dated as of february  this amendment  among other things  modified certain covenants under the credit facility  evidenced the lenders consent to certain transactions  including the restructuring to be effectuated by the company in the first quarter of  granted a security interest in the company s real property in jamestown  ny  erie  pa and greensboro  nc  prohibits the payment of cash dividends by the company and modified the amount of money the company can borrow under the credit facility from an aggregate  to an aggregate  the credit facility provides for revolving credit loans  swing line loans and multi currency loans  within the parameters described below 
the loan is due june  with a balloon payment of the then remaining principal and any accrued interest 
the company has classified all of the line of credit as long term debt  as there are no required principal payments due within the next months 
at the company s option  borrowings may be effectuated  subject to certain conditions  on a nybor rate  an eurocurrency rate for dollars  an applicable eurocurrency rate for certain foreign currencies  a money market rate  or an alternative base rate 
eurocurrency loans bear interest at the then current applicable libor rate  plus an applicable margin  which varies from to  depending upon the company s ability to satisfy certain quarterly financial tests 
alternative base rate loans generally bear interest at the prime rate  plus an applicable margin  which varies from to depending upon the company s ability to satisfy certain quarterly financial tests 
in addition  the credit agreement permits the company to request the issuance of up to a maximum of  in letters of credit  which issuance will be deemed part of the  maximum amount of borrowing permitted under the credit facility 
the line of credit agreement  as amended  provides for achieving certain consolidated cash flow coverage and leverage ratios  prescribes minimum consolidated net worth requirements  limits capital expenditures and new leases and provides for certain other affirmative and restrictive covenants 
the company is in compliance with all of these requirements

for a summary of all of the company s accounting policies  including the accounting policies discussed below  see note to the notes to consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of this annual report on form k requires the company to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amount of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements  and the reported amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting period 
there can be no assurance that actual results will not differ from those estimates 
revenue recognition and accounts receivable revenues are recognized when products are shipped 
provisions for discounts  rebates to customers  returns and other adjustments are provided for in the same period that related sales are recorded 
the recording of these provisions requires the use of estimates  and future periods will be impacted if the actual costs differ from the estimated amounts 
for all sales  the company uses purchase orders from the customer  whether written  oral or electronically transmitted  as evidence of the transaction 
collateral is generally not requested from customers 
the company performs periodic credit evaluations of its customers 
the company continuously monitors collections and payments from its customers and maintains a provision for estimated credit losses based upon the company s historical experience and any specific customer collection issues that it has identified 
while such credit losses have historically been within the company s expectations and the provisions established  the company cannot guarantee that it will continue to experience the same credit loss rates that it has experienced in the past 
in addition  in part  to limit credit risk on occasion and to accelerate collections of certain outstanding accounts receivables  the company has sold certain accounts receivables  without recourse to it in the event of non payment  to certain banks 
the company s accounts receivable balance was million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of million as of december  and million  net of allowance for doubtful accounts of as of december  inventories inventories  consisting of raw materials  work in progress and finished goods  are stated at the lower of cost or market as determined by the first in  first out method 
inventories that the company estimates as either obsolete or unmarketable are written down based upon the difference between the cost of the inventory and its estimated market value 
the company s estimates as to such value are based  in part  on projected future demand and market conditions 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  additional write downs may be required 
obsolete and slow moving inventory reserves were approximately  and  at december  and december   respectively 
property  plant and equipment property  plant and equipment is carried at cost 
depreciation is computed by the straight line method over the estimated useful lives of the assets  which are as follows buildings and improvements years  machinery and equipment years  transportation equipment years  office equipment years  and leasehold improvements years or the lease term  if less 
construction in progress is recorded in property  plant and equipment and amounted to  and  at december  and december   respectively 
interest associated with construction indebtedness is capitalized 
interest amounting to approximately   and  associated with construction in progress was capitalized for  and  respectively 
the cost of repairs and maintenance is charged to expense as incurred 
renewals and betterments are capitalized 
upon retirement or sale of an asset  its cost and related accumulated depreciation or amortization are removed from the accounts and any gain or loss is recorded in income or expense 
the company continually reviews property  plant and equipment to determine that the carrying values have not been impaired by estimating the future undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use of the property  plant and equipment 
other assets goodwill other assets consist primarily of goodwill  cash value of life insurance policies  advances on split dollar insurance arrangements  an investment at cost  and other intangible assets 
the company tests long lived assets  exclusive of goodwill  for recoverability whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that its carrying amount may not be recoverable 
an impairment loss shall be recognized if the carrying amount of long lived assets  to be held and used is not recoverable and exceeds its fair value based on the sum of the undiscounted cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of the asset 
in the company s review of such assets  it is required to make certain estimates and projections 
if these estimates or related projections change in the future  the company may be required to record impairment charges for these assets 
at least annually and whenever events and changes in circumstances warrant  the company compares the fair value of the reporting unit to its carrying amount to determine if there is potential impairment of goodwill 
if the fair value of the reporting unit is less than its carrying value  an impairment loss is recorded to the extent that the fair value of the goodwill within the reporting unit is less than their carrying value 
fair values for goodwill are determined based on discounted cash flows  market multiples or appraised values as appropriate 
the conditions that would trigger an impairment assessment of goodwill include a significant negative trend in the company s operating results or cash flows  a decrease in demand for the company s products  a change in the competitive environment and other industry and economic factors 
accounting for income taxes as part of the process of preparing the consolidated financial statements  the company is required to estimate its income taxes in each of the jurisdictions in which it operates 
this process involves the company estimating its actual current tax exposure together with assessing temporary differences resulting from differing treatment of items  for tax and book purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities  which are included within the company s consolidated balance sheet 
the company must then assess the likelihood that its deferred tax assets will be recovered from future taxable income and to the extent the company believes that recovery is not likely  it must establish a valuation allowance 
to the extent the company establishes a valuation allowance or increases this allowance in a period  the company must include an expense within the tax provision in the statement of operations 
significant management judgment is required in determining the provision for income taxes  the deferred tax assets and liabilities and any valuation allowance recorded against the net deferred tax assets 
in the event that actual results differ from the company s estimates or it adjusts these estimates in future periods  the company may need to establish an additional valuation allowance which could impact its financial position and results of operations
