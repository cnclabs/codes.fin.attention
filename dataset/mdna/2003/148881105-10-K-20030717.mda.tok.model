item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included in this annual report on form k 
in addition  in order to take advantage of the safe harbor provisions of the private securities litigation reform act of  we hereby notify our readers that the factors set forth in certain factors that may affect our future results as set forth below in this item  as well as other factors  in the past have affected and in the future could affect our actual results and could cause our results for future periods to differ materially from those expressed in any forward looking statements made by or on our behalf  including without limitation those made in this report 
all forward looking statements included in this report are based upon information available to us on the date of filing and we assume no obligation to update such forward looking statements 
overview catalyst semiconductor  inc  was incorporated on october  and designs  develops and markets nonvolatile memory semiconductor products including serial and parallel eeproms  flash memory and mixed signal devices 
revenues are derived from sales of semiconductor products designed by us and manufactured by other companies 
our business is highly cyclical and has been subject to significant downturns at various times which have been characterized by reduced product demand  production overcapacity and significant erosion of average selling prices 
throughout fiscal and fiscal  the market for certain flash and eeprom devices  which comprise the majority of our business  experienced an excess market supply relative to demand which resulted in a significant downward trend in prices 
during fiscal and the first half of fiscal  we reduced our manufacturing costs  increased the efficiency of our manufacturing operations and the selling prices for certain products that we produce increased  all contributing to the increased gross margin percentages 
during the second half of fiscal  we experienced cancellations of orders by our customers  increased supplies of competitive products  decreased prices and decreasing revenues 
revenues  gross profits  selling prices and net income continued to decline through the second quarter of fiscal in the second half of fiscal and throughout fiscal  quarterly revenues  gross profits and net income were steadier 
we could  however  experience an increase in our manufacturing costs  a decrease in our unit shipments and a further downward trend in product pricing in the future  all factors which could adversely affect our operating results 
because a large portion of our orders are scheduled for shipment within a short time and our backlog is subject to cancellation and rescheduling  the value of our backlog is not a meaningful indicator of our business 
critical accounting policies and estimates the preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles gaap in the united states of america requires management to make estimates and judgments that affect the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses  and related disclosures 
on an on going basis  we evaluate our estimates  including those related to product shipments and returns  bad debts  inventories  income taxes  warranty obligations  contingencies and litigation 
we base these estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances  the results of which form the basis for making judgments about the carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources 
actual results may differ from these estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
specifically  we believe that the following accounting policies and estimates are most important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results and require management s most difficult judgments inventory reserves we record inventory reserves for estimated unmarketable inventory equal to the cost of inventory estimated to be in excess based upon assumptions about future demand and market conditions 
we generally reserve inventory in excess of future demand for the ensuing twelve months 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  inventory write downs are also required 
inventory reserves are also taken based upon our estimate of the future selling prices of our inventories 
whenever the estimated future selling price is less than the value of and the estimated cost to sell any portion of our 
table of contents inventory  a reserve is taken for the amount by which the cost of the inventory and costs to sell exceeds the estimated future selling price 
if we overestimate the future selling prices  we will incur additional losses when the inventory is sold for a lower price or when we establish additional reserves to cover the even lower estimated sales price 
once established  inventory reserves are not reversed until the associated inventory has been sold or physically scrapped 
revenue recognition for products sold directly to end users  original equipment manufacturers  or to resellers that do not receive price concessions and do not have rights of return  we recognize revenue upon shipment and title transfer if we believe collection is reasonably assured 
reserves for sales returns and allowances are estimated based primarily upon historical experience and provided at the time of shipment 
for sales to distributors with agreements allowing for price concessions and product returns  we recognize revenue at the time the distributor sells the product to its end customer 
revenue is not recognized upon shipment since  due to various forms of price concessions  the sales price is not substantially fixed or determinable at that time 
additionally  these distributors have contractual rights to return products  up to a specified amount  for a given period of time 
revenue is recognized when a distributor sells the product to an end user  at which time the sales price becomes fixed 
on our sales to end users  we record estimated reductions to revenue for the return of products at the time revenue is recognized 
if market conditions were to weaken  we may face higher volumes of product returns possibly resulting in an incremental reduction of revenue at the time products are returned 
if we were to experience an increased rate of product returns  our sales would be further reduced by the increased reserves taken to cover the increased amount of our products expected to be returned 
at the time of shipment to distributors  we record a trade receivable for the selling price since there is a legally enforceable right to payment  we relieve inventory for the carrying value of the goods shipped since legal title has passed to the distributor and we record the gross margin in deferred gross profit on shipments to distributors  a component of current liabilities on our balance sheet 
deferred margin represents the gross margin on the sale to the distributor  however  the amount of gross margin we recognize in future periods could be less than the deferred margin as a result of price concessions 
we do not reduce deferred margin by estimated future price concessions  instead  price concessions are recorded when incurred  which is generally at the time the distributor sells the product to an end user 
the difference between deferred margin and the margin actually recognized has not been material in the past  however  since price concessions are highly dependent upon market conditions  there can be no assurance that the difference will not be material in the future 
price concessions are not granted for amounts in excess of the deferred margin 
allowances for doubtful accounts we maintain allowances for doubtful accounts for estimated losses resulting from the inability of our customers to make required payments 
if the financial condition of our customers were to deteriorate  resulting in an impairment of their ability to make payments  additional allowances may be required 
bad debt expenses  when incurred  are included in our selling expenses 
valuation allowances 
in prior years  we recorded substantial valuation allowances to reduce our deferred tax assets to the amount that was more likely than not to be realized 
as of april   we estimated that amount based on the experience during the year then ended 
we have considered estimated future taxable income in assessing the need for the valuation allowance 
in the fourth quarter of fiscal  we determined that the amount of deferred tax assets that we would be able to realize aggregated million and the valuation allowance was reduced accordingly which increased income and shareholders equity for the fourth quarter and fiscal we continue to record a valuation allowance of million as of april  which may be released as we revise our estimates of the likelihood of portions of that amount being realized 
the release of up to million of that allowance will also benefit our net income and shareholders equity if and when it is 
table of contents released 
the remaining million of valuation allowance will be credited to additional paid in capital if and when it is released 
results of operations fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenues 
total revenues consist of net product sales 
a substantial portion of net product sales are made through independent distributors 
revenues from product sales to original equipment manufacturers and from sales to distributors who have no  or limited  product return rights and no price protection rights  is recognized upon shipment net of allowances for estimated returns 
when distributors have rights to return products or price protection rights  we defer revenue recognition until the distributor sells the product to the end customer 
total revenues increased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a increase in the quantity of our eeprom products sold  the impact of which on our revenues was partially reduced by the effect of a reduction in the average selling price of our products during fiscal caused by an excess supply of semiconductors and other unfavorable industry wide conditions 
shipments of our eeprom devices increased by million to million  or of revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of revenues  in the prior year 
the increase was also attributable to the slightly improved market conditions 
shipments of our flash memory devices decreased by million to million  or of revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of revenues  in the prior year 
the decrease in flash product sales was also attributable to the deteriorating market conditions for the smaller memory sizes that we produce 
shipments of our mixed signal products were approximately  for fiscal  compared to approximately  in fiscal the increase in mixed signal product shipments was due to the limited but growing number of products available for sale and because most of these products were recently introduced 
we expect sales of our mixed signal products to increase in absolute dollars and on a percentage of revenue basis as we continue to introduce additional products and continue our efforts to gain customer acceptance of this product line 
sales to customers outside the united states contributed approximately of total revenues in fiscal as compared to of total revenues in fiscal the increase in percentage of international revenues in fiscal was primarily attributable to our increased sales in japan and europe due to our increased sales efforts in those regions 
substantially all sales of our products are in us dollars  minimizing the effects of currency fluctuations 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or a gross margin of  compared to gross profit of million  or a gross margin of  for fiscal the increase in gross profit was primarily attributable to the impact of a increase in units shipped  the impact of which on gross profit was reduced by a decrease in the average selling prices or our products 
in fiscal and  we benefited from the release of and million  respectively  in inventory reserves due to the sale or other disposal of inventories previously reserved 
the impacts on our gross profits from such reserve releases were reduced by additions to our inventory reserves of and million  respectively  in fiscal and it is our policy to fully reserve all inventories that are not expected to be sold in a reasonable period of time from the balance sheet date  generally within the ensuing twelve months 
we pay certain foreign manufacturing expenses in local currency  primarily baht in thailand and yen in japan 
these expenses in foreign currencies have not been material to us in the past 
we do not hedge our exposure fluctuations in these currencies relative to the us dollar 
a change in the exchange rate of the thai baht to the us dollar would have had a impact on our cost of goods sold in fiscal a change in the exchange rate of the japanese yen to the us dollar would have had a impact on our cost of goods sold in fiscal research and development 
research and development r d expenses consist principally of salaries for engineering  technical and support personnel  contract engineering services  depreciation of equipment and the cost of wafers used to evaluate new products and new versions of current products 
r d expenses increased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the increase was primarily attributable to a  increase in personnel related expenses and a  increase in the depreciation of software and equipment purchased for development purposes 
as of april   we employed people in research and development activities  compared to employees plus under our informal arrangement with lxi as of april  the increase was primarily attributable to the hiring of engineers at catalyst 
table of contents semiconductor romania srl csr  our recently formed subsidiary in romania  to replace and expand the engineering services previously provided by lxi 
as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses increased to in fiscal from in fiscal since most of the costs of csr such as rent and payroll are valued in united states dollars  the amount of our r d expenses in currencies other than the us dollar has been minimal 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative sg a expenses consist principally of salaries for sales  marketing and administrative personnel  commissions  promotional activities  professional fees and director and officer d o insurance 
sg a expenses decreased  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a  decrease in commissions paid to outside representatives  a  reduction in legal expenses and a  decrease in bad debt expense 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses decreased to in fiscal from in fiscal the reason for the decrease in sg a expenses as a percentage of revenue was the decrease in expenses on an absolute dollar basis and the increase in revenues 
a change in the exchange rate of the japanese yen to the us dollar would have had a impact on our sg a expenses in fiscal net interest income and expense 
we earned net interest income of  or of revenues  in fiscal compared to net interest income of  or of revenues  in fiscal the decrease in net interest income was primarily attributable to the decreased interest rate paid on our cash balances 
income tax provision 
the effective income tax benefit rate was in fiscal  as compared to an income tax expense rate of in fiscal the difference between our fiscal and tax rates is primarily attributable to the release of a portion of the valuation allowance previously provided on net deferred tax assets 
fiscal year ended april  compared to fiscal year ended april  revenues 
total revenues decreased by to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a decrease in sales of our eeprom products  as well as a reduction in the average selling price of our products during fiscal  caused by an excess supply of semiconductors and other unfavorable industry wide conditions 
shipments of our eeprom devices decreased by million to million  or of revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of revenues  in the prior year 
the decrease was also attributable to the deteriorating market conditions 
shipments of our flash memory devices decreased by million to million  or of revenues  in fiscal compared to million  or of revenues  in the prior year 
the decrease in flash product sales was also attributable to the deteriorating market conditions 
shipments of our mixed signal products were  for fiscal  compared to  in fiscal the increase in mixed signal product shipments was due to the limited number of products available for sale and because most of these products were introduced in fiscal international sales contributed of total revenues in fiscal as compared to of total revenues in fiscal the increase in percentage of international revenues in fiscal was primarily attributable to our increased sales in asia due to increased market demand and our ability to be more competitive in the region as a result of certain cost reductions 
gross profit 
gross profit for fiscal was million  or a gross margin of  compared to gross profit of million  or a gross margin of  for fiscal the decrease in gross profit was primarily attributable to decreased selling prices and decreased revenues 
in fiscal and  we benefited from the release of and million  respectively  in inventory reserves due to the sale or other disposal of inventories previously reserved 
the decrease in gross margin percentage in fiscal was due to decreased selling prices and decreases in the level of sales of products with higher gross margins 
research and development 
r d expenses decreased to million in fiscal from million in fiscal the decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in wafers purchased for development purposes 
as of april   we employed people in research and development activities in addition to the equivalent of more at lxi  compared to employees plus at lxi as of april  as a percentage of revenues  r d expenses increased to from from fiscal to fiscal this increase in percentage was attributable to the decrease in revenues 

table of contents selling  general and administrative 
sg a expenses decreased million  or  to million in fiscal from million in fiscal this decrease was primarily attributable to a million decrease in personnel related expenses  principally related to reduced bonuses and commissions for employees due to our decreased profitability and a million decrease in commissions paid to outside representatives as a result of the decrease in revenues 
as a percentage of revenues  sg a expenses increased to from from fiscal to fiscal the reason for the increase in the percentage of revenue was the decrease in revenues 
net interest income and expense 
we earned net interest income of  or of revenues  in fiscal compared to net interest income of  or of revenues  in fiscal the decrease in net interest income was primarily attributable to the decreased interest rate paid on our cash balances 
income tax provision 
the effective income tax expense rate was in fiscal as compared with in fiscal the difference between our fiscal and tax rates was due to our utilization of net operating loss and credit carryforwards in fiscal  and our inability to benefit from net operating losses and credits carryforwards generated in fiscal liquidity and capital resources total cash decreased million to million as of april  from million as of april  primarily due to our net purchase of million in short term investments 
net cash provided by operations was million for fiscal  which was due primarily to net income of million  adjusted for depreciation and amortization of million  additions to inventory reserves of million  a reduction of gross accounts receivable of million and an increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities of million mostly from tax related adjustments 
such increases were partially offset by releases of inventory reserves of million resulting from shipments of previously reserved inventory  a reduction in gross inventories of  a reduction in accounts payable of million primarily due to reductions in inventory purchases  an increase in deferred tax assets of million and a decrease in the deferred gross profit on distributor sales due to decreased inventories and margins at distributors of  for fiscal  net cash of million was provided by operations  principally by net income of  adjusted for depreciation and amortization of approximately million  an addition to the provision for doubtful accounts of  a net increase in the provision for excess and obsolete inventory of  and a decrease in gross accounts receivable of million related to decreased sales  an increase in accounts payable of  related to our increased wafer purchases and an increase in other credits of million 
such increases were partially offset by an increase in gross inventories of  an increase in other current assets of  related to an expected refund of income taxes paid in a previous year and a decrease in accrued expenses of million 
our investing activities used million during fiscal which was primarily related to million utilized for the net purchases of short term investments and to million primarily for the acquisition of design software and equipment for r d and our manufacturing operations 
cash used in investing activities for fiscal was  which was primarily related to the purchase of equipment for our manufacturing operations 
financing activities used million during fiscal  consisting primarily of million utilized for the repurchase of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock from open market purchases made through our announced open market repurchase program 
net cash provided by the sale of our common stock through the exercise of stock options totaled  during fiscal financing activities used million during fiscal  consisting primarily of million utilized for the repurchase of an aggregate of  shares of our common stock  million of which were repurchased in a private transaction and the remainder of which were open market purchases made through our announced open market repurchase program and approximately million was used to pay off the bank credit line and the remaining capital lease obligations 
net cash provided by the sale of common stock through the exercise of stock options totaled  during fiscal in september  the board of directors authorized a program for the open market repurchase of up to million shares of our common stock and in march increased the authorized limit to a total of 
table of contents million shares 
the purpose of this share repurchase program is to reduce the long term potential dilution in earnings per share that might result from issuances under our stock option plans and to take advantage of the relatively low price of our common stock 
we have no immediate plans to reissue the repurchased shares and we intend to hold such shares in treasury until suitable opportunities arise 
the following table summarizes the activity of the repurchase program through april  shares total cost avg 
cost years ended april  repurchased of shares per share total additionally  in a separately authorized transaction in april  we purchased million shares of our common stock from our largest shareholder  elex for per share which represented a discount from the closing price on the date of the purchase 
as of april   we were indebted to various creditors in the amount of approximately million 
this amount is comprised of approximately million for wafers and inventory processing and approximately  for other goods and services 
we do not have any material contractual obligations or commercial commitments to make any future payments other than with respect to the facilities lease for our principal business office in sunnyvale which will expire in the lease agreement allows us to exercise an option to extend the term by an additional five years 
further  we do not engage in any off balance sheet financing arrangements or transactions other than the standard building leases 
the following table shows the aggregate future minimum lease payments  by fiscal year  that we are obligated to pay under the terms of the non cancelable operating leases we currently have for our various facilities  principally our headquarters building in sunnyvale  california in thousands operating years ending april  leases in light of the current economic and competitive climate  we continue to monitor our liquid resources 
we believe our existing cash and cash equivalents and anticipated cash flows from our operating activities will be sufficient to fund our working capital and capital expenditure needs for at least the next months 
in our competitive industry  we must constantly consider the need to make significant expenditures in connection with our research and development efforts 
we may use cash to invest in businesses  products and or technologies which we believe to be strategic 
however  we have no present commitments or obligations with respect to any acquisition of other businesses or technology 
we have no present intention to seek additional debt or equity financing  but our need to do so is highly dependent upon factors such as the demand for our products and changes in industry and general economic conditions 
in the event that we do determine to seek such financing  there can be no assurance that such financing will be available on acceptable terms  if at all  and any additional equity financing could result in incremental dilution to our existing investors 
effects of transactions with related parties during the fourth quarter of fiscal  catalyst began taking delivery of wafers fabricated at x fab texas  inc xfab  a wholly owned subsidiary of elex nv  a belgian holding company that owned of our outstanding common stock as of june  mr 
roland duch telet  the chairman and chief executive officer of elex nv  serves as a member of our board of directors 
the wafers provided by xfab supplement the same designs fabricated at oki semiconductor in japan  our principal wafer fab 
other than purchase 
table of contents orders currently open with xfab  there is no purchasing agreement in place with xfab 
each purchase order remains open until the wafers are delivered  which is generally within two months of placement of the order  although in the case of one particular wafer design under development  we have prepaid a purchase order which calls for a mask set and delivery of a prototype wafer lot at a future time to be determined by future events 
the prices of wafers purchased from xfab are determined by periodic negotiations with the management of xfab and compared to quotes obtained from other prospective wafer fabricators and pricing surveys published by various industry trade organizations 
during fiscal  our purchases from xfab totaled million 
as of april   the total amount owed xfab was  we had an informal arrangement from through january to obtain engineering services from lxi corporation  a california corporation lxi  a provider of engineering services through essex com srl essex  lxi s wholly owned subsidiary in romania 
the number of full time engineers we used was dependent upon the scope and number of research and development projects in process at a given time 
for example  during the month of january  essex employed the equivalent of approximately full time engineers to perform services on our behalf 
these services related to our key development projects including development  design  layout and test program development services 
we believe that we received these engineering services from lxi on terms and at rates that were at least as favorable  if not more favorable  than we could obtain from unaffiliated third parties 
two of our officers  messrs 
voicu and gay  owned approximately and  respectively  of lxi until february mr 
gay  who had served as a director of lxi  resigned from that position in january messrs 
voicu and gay received no payments from lxi during fiscal and fiscal other than  and  respectively  from the repurchase of their shares at net book value by lxi in february additionally  we believe that our former ceo  mr 
radu vanco  continues to own a majority of the outstanding shares of lxi 
in january  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary in romania  catalyst semiconductor  romania com srl csr  to perform these engineering design services on our behalf and discontinued our use of the engineering services of lxi in january during fiscal  and we recorded   and  respectively  of engineering fees from lxi for engineering design services provided by essex 
as of april   there was no amount owed to lxi 
one of our directors  mr 
lionel allan  also served as a consultant to us through his consulting company  allan advisors  inc under the terms of his consulting agreement  we paid consulting fees of  per month throughout fiscal and in april  we terminated the agreement and paid the  balance due as required by the agreement 
the consulting agreement was to expire on august  mr 
allan no longer provides consulting services to us and we have no continuing obligations to mr 
allan under the prior agreement 
recent accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses significant issues regarding the recognition  measurement and reporting of costs that are associated with exit and disposal activities  including restructuring activities that are currently accounted for under eitf no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
the scope of sfas also includes costs related to terminating a contract that is not a capital lease and termination benefits that employees who are involuntarily terminated receive under the terms of a one time benefit arrangement that is not an ongoing benefit arrangement or an individual deferred compensation contract 
sfas was effective for exit or disposal activities that were initiated after december  we adopted sfas during the quarter ended january  which had no effect on our financial statements 
the provisions of eitf no 
shall continue to apply for an exit activity initiated under an exit plan that met the criteria of eitf no 
prior to the adoption of sfas the effect of the adoption of sfas will change on a prospective basis the timing of when restructuring charges are recorded from a commitment date approach to the date the liability is incurred 
in november  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others fin 

table of contents fin requires that a liability be recorded in the guarantor s balance sheet upon issuance of a guarantee 
in addition  fin requires disclosures about the guarantees that an entity has issued  including a reconciliation of changes in the entity s product warranty liabilities 
the initial recognition and initial measurement provisions of fin are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december   irrespective of the guarantor s fiscal year end 
catalyst applied the recognition provisions of fin prospectively to guarantees issued after december  the adoption of fin did not have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in december  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for stock based compensation  transition and disclosure sfas 
sfas provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
sfas also requires that disclosures of the pro forma effect of using the fair value method of accounting for stock based employee compensation be displayed more prominently and in a tabular format 
additionally  sfas requires disclosure of the pro forma effect in interim financial statements 
the transition and annual disclosure requirements of sfas are effective for fiscal years ended after december  the interim disclosure requirements are effective for interim periods beginning after december  the adoption of this standard did not have a material impact on our financial statements 
the disclosure required by sfas is made in these consolidated financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued fasb interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities  an interpretation of arb no 
fin 
fin requires certain variable interest entities to be consolidated by the primary beneficiary of the entity if the equity investors in the entity do not have the characteristics of a controlling financial interest or do not have sufficient equity at risk for the entity to finance its activities without additional subordinated financial support from other parties 
fin is effective immediately for all new variable interest entities created or acquired after january  for variable interest entities created or acquired prior to february   the provisions of fin must be applied for the first interim or annual period beginning after june  we do not expect the adoption of fin to have a significant impact on our consolidated financial statements 
in may  fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
this statement establishes standards for how an issuer classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
it requires that an issuer classifies a financial instrument that is within its scope as a liability or an asset in some circumstances 
many of those instruments were previously classified as equity 
the statement is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  it is to be implemented by reporting the cumulative effect of a change in an accounting principle for financial instruments created before the issuance date of the statement and still existing at the beginning of the interim period of adoption 
restatement is not permitted 
we believe that adoption of this standard will not have a material impact on our financial statements 
certain risks that may affect our future results our quarterly operating results may fluctuate due to many factors and are difficult to forecast 
our operating results have historically been and in future quarters may be adversely affected or otherwise fluctuate due to factors such as fluctuations in customer demand for our products  volatility in supply and demand affecting semiconductor market prices generally such as the increases in supply of competitive products and significant declines in average selling prices experienced by us in fiscal  and  the need to establish additional inventory reserves due to the expected average selling prices falling below the amounts paid to produce and sell certain parts  or if our expectations for sales of our inventory fall below the quantities that we have on hand  charges to bad debt expense caused by accounts receivable that become unlikely to be collected in a reasonable amount of time  if ever  
table of contents the timing of new product introductions and significant orders of our products  increased expenses associated with new product introductions  process changes and or expanding our sales channels  gains or losses of significant customers  fluctuations in manufacturing yields  changes in our product mix  increases in wafer prices due to increased market demand and other factors  prices charged by our suppliers due to increased costs  decreased competition and other factors  foreign currency fluctuations  and general economic conditions 
we anticipate that a significant portion of our revenues may be derived from a limited number of large orders and we expect that the timing of receipt and fulfillment of these orders may cause fluctuations which could be material to our operating results  particularly on a quarterly basis 
our quarterly revenues and operating results are difficult to forecast 
we base our expense levels  in significant part  on our expectations as to future revenues and our expenses are therefore relatively fixed in the short term 
if our revenues fall below our forecasts  as occurred during fiscal  net income is likely to be disproportionately adversely affected because our costs are relatively fixed in the short term 
the semiconductor industry is highly cyclical in nature 
we operate in a highly cyclical industry that has been subject to significant economic downturns often in connection with  or in anticipation of  maturing product cycles and declines in general economic conditions 
this type of downturn occurred in calendar and and we currently face and in the future may face diminished product demand  accelerated erosion of average selling prices and gross margins and production overcapacity during such downturns  which may last for more than a year 
accordingly  we may experience substantial period to period fluctuations in future operating results due to general semiconductor industry conditions  overall economic conditions or other factors 
for example  we experienced accelerated erosion of average selling prices caused by adverse industry wide conditions during fiscal  fiscal and the first half of fiscal and incurred substantial losses during that period 
during late fiscal  the semiconductor market rebounded from its cyclical decline which had a favorable impact on both our revenues and our gross margins through the quarter ended october during the second half of fiscal and the first half of fiscal  however  the market for our products became more competitive as a result of increased availability of products when demand was decreasing 
since the quarter ended october  we have seen increased quarterly revenues but the rate of revenue growth that we experienced may not be sustained and could be reversed 
thus we are concerned about the ability of continued price and other competitive pressures to adversely affect our future operating results similar to the adverse affects on our fiscal  and operating results 
our continued success depends in large part on the continued growth of various electronics industries that use semiconductors 
the improved market conditions we experienced in calendar and calendar have deteriorated significantly 
during late calendar to mid calendar  we experienced decreases in orders from customers and found that lower selling prices were necessary to remain competitive in the market 
we attempt to identify changes in market conditions as soon as possible  however  market dynamics make our prediction of and timely reaction to such events difficult 
our business could be harmed in the future by additional cyclical downturns in the semiconductor industry or by slower growth by any of the markets served by our customers products 
general economic conditions may reduce our revenues and harm our business 
we are subject to the risks arising from adverse changes in domestic and global economic conditions 
because of the current worldwide economic slowdown and  the recession in the united states in particular  many industries are delaying or reducing technology purchases 
the impact of this slowdown on us is difficult 
table of contents to predict  but it may result in reductions in purchases of our products by our customers  longer sales cycles and increased price competition 
as a result  if the current economic slowdown continues or worsens  we may fall short of our expectations of revenues for any given quarter or for the entire fiscal year 
these conditions would negatively affect our business  financial condition and results of operations 
if our products fail to keep pace with the rapid technological changes in the semiconductor industry  we could lose customers and revenue 
our product markets are characterized by rapidly changing technology and product obsolescence 
a key factor to our business success is the timely introduction of new products at competitive price and performance levels 
in particular  our future success will depend on our ability to develop and implement new design and process technologies which enable us to achieve higher product densities and thereby reduce product costs 
for example  most of our products are currently designed and manufactured using a micron cmos eeprom process or a micron flash memory process 
although we have recently implemented a micron cmos process for our eeprom products  the time and expense of converting our products to this process will consume a considerable portion of our resources which may result in a reduction of our costs more slowly than the price erosion the effort is intended to counteract  resulting in limited benefit  if any 
we may not be able to select and develop new products and technologies and introduce them to the market in a timely manner and with acceptable fabrication yields and production costs 
furthermore  our products may not achieve market acceptance 
our failure to complete and introduce new products at competitive price performance levels could materially and adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by delays in developing new products  achievement of volume production of new products  successful completion of technology transitions with acceptable yields and reliability  or the lack of commercial acceptance of new products we introduce to the market 
we depend on a small number of suppliers for the supply of wafers 
we do not manufacture the semiconductor wafers used for our products 
oki in japan has supplied wafers to us since and was our sole foundry source until the end of fiscal at that time  an additional foundry  xfab  began to provide a limited number of products to us and the volumes currently provided by xfab are considerably less than oki currently provides 
we do not presently have a wafer supply agreement with oki or xfab and instead purchase wafers on a purchase order and acceptance basis 
our almost exclusive reliance on these independent foundries involves a number of risks  including the risk of inadequate wafer supplies to meet our production needs  increased prices charged by such independent foundries  the unavailability of or interruption in access to required or more cost effective process technologies  reduced control over delivery schedules  manufacturing yields and costs  and the risks associated with international operations more fully described below 
we are not always able to obtain sufficient increased quantities of wafers from oki and xfab to fulfill some of the current customer demand 
although we have a wafer purchase agreement with umc for certain flash products which runs through february  due to declining flash bookings and other circumstances  we have not ordered any wafers from umc since december to address our wafer supply concerns  we plan to continue working on expanding our primary foundry capability at oki and our secondary foundry capability with xfab at its facility in lubbock  texas 
xfab is owned by elex nv which is a stockholder of catalyst as of june  and mr 
roland duch telet  the chairman and ceo of elex nv  serves as a member of our board of directors 
the addition of xfab as a second foundry source has enabled us to somewhat reduce the risks associated with the sourcing and quantity of our wafer supply and thereby improve control over an important component of our business  however  sufficient capacity may not be available from xfab 
additionally  oki may not continue to provide sufficient capacity in the future and that capacity may not be available from another manufacturer at prices acceptable to us 
even if such capacity is available  the qualification process and time required to make the foundry fully 
table of contents operational for us could take many months or longer and be subject to other factors described below and the prices could be materially higher 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of oki or xfab as a supplier  our inability to obtain additional capacity at oki or xfab  our inability to qualify xfab for additional products  our ability to qualify other wafer manufacturers for desired foundry capacity  or any other circumstances causing a significant interruption in our supply of semiconductor wafers 
although we have earned a profit for the five most recent fiscal years  we may not be able to sustain or increase that profitability 
we have incurred significant losses or experienced significant negative cash flow from operations during several fiscal years previous to fiscal such negative cash flow significantly reduced our available capital to a point that  as of april   we had a net worth deficit of million 
although as of april   we had cash on hand and short term investments totaling million  we may not continue to generate sufficient revenues and net income to fund our operations 
we have pursued many measures designed to reduce expenses and conserve our cash in prior periods when we experienced decreased or negative cash flow such as the renegotiation of pricing with manufacturers and suppliers  the transition of engineering services to a lower cost model  the implementation of employee hiring freezes  the reduction of employee headcount and the increased oversight of authorized expense 
we continue to monitor expenses and to conserve our available cash 
however  to the extent we suffer any adverse effects to our revenues or net income because of delays in new product introductions  price competition or other competitive factors  our cash position and our business  operating results and financial condition will be adversely affected 
we may need to seek additional equity or debt financing to address our working capital needs and to provide funding for capital expenditures although we have no present intention to do so 
if required  additional funding may not be available at acceptable terms  if at all 
if we are successful in raising additional funds through the issuance of equity securities  our existing stockholders could experience significant dilution or the securities may have rights  preferences or privileges senior to those of our common stock 
if adequate funds are not available to us or are not available on acceptable terms  further reductions in our operating expenses and capital expenditures may be required to continue operations  either of which could have a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition 
the trading price of our common stock could be subject to wide fluctuations in response to a variety of factors 
our stock price has been and may continue to be subject to significant volatility 
for example  in fiscal  the closing sales prices of our common stock ranged from a low of to a high of 
any shortfall in revenues or earnings from levels expected or projected by investors or others could have an immediate and significant adverse effect on the trading price of our common stock in any given period 
in addition  the stock market in general has experienced extreme price and volume fluctuations  affecting the market prices for many high technology companies and small capitalization companies and these fluctuations have often been unrelated to the operating performance of the specific companies 
these broad fluctuations may adversely affect the market price for our common stock 
the manufacture of semiconductor wafers is highly complex and sensitive to a wide variety of factors that may adversely affect our ability to generate future revenues 
the manufacture of semiconductor wafers for our products is highly complex and sensitive to a wide variety of factors typical in the semiconductor industry such as lower than anticipated production yields experienced by outside wafer foundries from time to time  incurring the time and expense to develop alternative foundry sources  experiencing substandard yield during the initial developmental stages of a new process  
table of contents inability to receive sufficient quantities of wafers at favorable prices on a timely basis  especially in periods of increased demand  material disruptions in the supply of wafers as a result of low manufacturing yield or other manufacturing problems  and production transition delays 
our ability to generate future revenues may be adversely affected by such delays and reductions that result in the cancellation of customer orders 
thus  any of the following events could delay shipments  result in the loss of customers and have a material adverse effect on our business and operating results the loss of oki or xfab as a supplier  the failure to further develop xfab as a reliable foundry in an expeditious and cost effective manner  any prolonged inability to obtain adequate yields or deliveries from oki or xfab  and any other circumstance that would require us to seek and qualify alternative sources of supply of such products 
although we are exploring and seeking to develop alternative wafer supply sources such as xfab  we may not be able to obtain such alternative sources nor may we have adequate facilities available 
failure to have such supplies available would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
intense competition in our markets may lead to reduced average selling prices of our products  reduced sales of our products and reduced gross margins 
the semiconductor industry is intensely competitive and has been characterized by rapid price erosion  declining gross margins  rapid technological change  product obsolescence and heightened international competition in many markets 
average selling prices in the semiconductor industry generally and  for our products in particular  have decreased significantly and rapidly over the life of each product 
we expect that average selling prices for our existing products will decline rapidly in the future and that average selling prices for each new product will decline significantly over the life of the product 
declines in average selling prices for our products  if not offset by reductions in the cost of producing those products or by sales of new products with higher gross margins  would decrease our overall gross margins  could cause a negative adjustment to the valuation of our inventories and could materially and adversely affect our operating results 
we compete with major domestic and international semiconductor companies  most of which have substantially greater financial  technical  sales  marketing  production  distribution and other resources 
we may not be able to compete successfully in the future 
our more mature products  such as serial and parallel eeprom devices  compete on the basis of product performance  price and customer service 
we believe that we compete successfully with respect to each of these factors  however price competition is significant and expected to continue 
principal competitors with respect to our eeprom products currently include atmel corporation  stmicroelectronics nv  microchip technology inc  information storage devices inc and fairchild semiconductor international  inc  all of which have substantially greater resources than we do 
the market for flash memory products has been characterized by long production cycles  irregular yields  competing technologies and  particularly since the first quarter of fiscal  intense price competition resulting in major reductions in average selling prices and corresponding reductions in margins 
our flash memory products compete on the basis of product performance  price and customer service 
however  given the development of higher density lower cost products and the intense price competition prevalent for these products  we may not be able to compete successfully in the future against our competitors on the bases of these or other competitive factors 

table of contents we periodically experience an oversupply or shortage of wafer fabrication capacity due to volatile demand and thus we risk forecasting incorrectly and producing excess or insufficient inventories of particular products  which may adversely affect our results 
we have previously experienced periodic oversupply or shortages of wafer fabrication capacity due to the cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry 
since we must order products and build inventory substantially in advance of product shipments  we risk forecasting incorrectly and producing excess or insufficient inventories of particular products 
demand for our products is volatile and customers often place orders with short lead times 
the ability of our customers to reschedule or cancel orders without significant penalty could adversely affect our liquidity  as we may be unable to adjust our purchases from our wafer suppliers to match any customer changes and cancellations 
our inventory may not be reduced by the fulfillment of customer orders and in the future we may produce excess quantities of our products 
to the extent we have excess inventories of particular products  our operating results could be adversely affected by charges to cost of goods sold that we would be required to recognize due to significant reductions in demand for our products or rapid declines in the market value of inventory  resulting in inventory writedowns or other related factors 
for example  during the last half of fiscal  we recorded charges of approximately million to our cost of sales due to the rapid decrease in demand for and the selling prices of our products 
the net effect of such adjustments amounted to less than million in fiscal and were not material in fiscal inventory reserve adjustments in fiscal totaled million which were partially offset by the release of million of inventory reserves taken in previous periods relating to products that were sold during fiscal during fiscal  the net effect of inventory reserve adjustments was minimal 
during fiscal the net effect of inventory reserve adjustments was a net release of approximately  of inventory reserves 
in addition  in fiscal and to some extent during fiscal and fiscal  our ability to forecast future demand and selling prices diminished due to the increased uncertainty of the semiconductor market 
it is our policy to fully reserve all inventories that we do not expect to be sold in a reasonable period of time  generally within the ensuing twelve months from the balance sheet date 
during most of our recent fiscal years  as a result of reductions in estimated demand for our various products  we have provided additional reserves for excess quantities and obsolescence for certain products  primarily our flash and eeprom products 
in fiscal  the rapid erosion of selling prices also left us with significant amounts of inventory with a carrying value that exceeded its current selling price resulting in adjustments to the carrying value of the inventory to the lower of cost or market value 
we may suffer similar reductions in values of our inventories in the future and we may be unable to liquidate our inventory at acceptable prices 
we may not be able to sustain market acceptance for our flash memory products 
a significant amount of our net revenues have been and continue to be derived from sales of flash memory products 
flash memory products represented of our shipments during fiscal  in fiscal and of our shipments in fiscal the market for flash memory products has been characterized by intense price competition  long production cycles  inconsistent yields  competing technologies  rapidly declining average selling prices  declines in gross margins and intense overall competition 
our operating results in fiscal and were adversely affected by intense price competition caused by increased supplies of products and other adverse industry wide conditions 
intel and other competitors which include advanced micro devices inc  atmel corporation  fujitsu ltd  hitachi ltd  micron technology inc  mitsubishi electric corp  stmicroelectronics nv  sharp corp  texas instruments inc and toshiba corp 
are expected to further increase flash memory production 
most of these competitors are manufacturing and selling devices with larger memories which are utilized in more recently developed products such as digital cameras 
due to intense competition  limited development resources and other factors  we have decided not to develop any of the higher density flash memory devices at this time 
we may not be able to sustain the market acceptance for our flash memory products 
we rely on third party subcontractors to sort  assemble  test and ship our products to customers 
we outsource portions of our planning  finish work and test functions for certain products  as well as our inventory management function to subcontractors who are primarily located in thailand and the philippines 
this reliance on third parties subjects us to risks such as reduced control over delivery schedules and quality  a 
table of contents potential lack of adequate capacity during periods when demand is high and potential increases in product costs due to factors outside our control such as capacity shortages and currency risks 
such risks could lead to delays in product deliveries  lost sales and increased costs which could harm our customer relationships and result in lower profitability 
international sales comprise a significant portion of our product sales  which exposes us to foreign political and economic risks 
for fiscal  and  international sales comprised approximately  and  respectively  of our net revenues 
the rising percentage of our international sales has been primarily attributable to our increased sales efforts in those markets and our ability to compete with the low selling prices in certain asian markets 
we expect that international sales will continue to represent a significant portion of our product sales in the future 
however  our international operations may be adversely affected by the following factors greater fluctuations in demand for our products due to the increased sensitivity to pricing changes in certain markets  particularly asia  fluctuations in exchange rates  imposition of government controls  political and financial instability  trade restrictions  changes in regulatory requirements  difficulties in staffing international operations  and longer payment cycles 
currently  all our sales are invoiced and paid in us dollars  reducing our direct exposure to currency fluctuations 
recently  several customers in europe have requested that we develop the ability to invoice them in euros 
except for yoshikawa semiconductor in japan  a provider of wafer sorting services and certain contract personnel costs and incidental manufacturing supply purchases in thailand  over of our inventory purchases are in us dollars  minimizing any direct currency fluctuation risk 
our business however  is subject to other risks generally associated with doing business with foreign subcontractors including  but not limited to foreign government regulations and political and financial unrest which may cause disruptions or delays in shipments to our customers or access to our inventories 
our business  financial condition and results of operations may be materially adversely affected by these or other factors related to our international operations 
we have formed a wholly owned subsidiary in romania that  if not managed effectively  could cause our business to suffer 
in january  we formed a wholly owned subsidiary in romania to perform the engineering design services previously provided to us by lxi 
we have no prior experience in establishing or operating engineering services outside of our headquarters in sunnyvale  california 
our expansion of engineering design operations to remotely situated offices presents a number of substantial risks that could increase our operating expenses and adversely affect our operating results  financial condition and ability to deliver our products and grow our business  including difficulties in staffing and managing foreign operations  in particular attracting and retaining personnel qualified to provide high quality engineering design services  difficulties in coordinating our engineering operations in romania with those in california  diversion of management attention  difficulties in maintaining uniform standards  controls  procedures and policies with our romanian subsidiary  including product development management and financial consolidation  
table of contents political and economic instability  which may have an adverse impact on foreign exchange rates in romania  and could impair our ability to conduct our business in romania  and inadequacy of the local infrastructure to support our needs 
a relatively small number of customers accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in the past and the loss of one or more of our current customers  additional volume pricing arrangements or unanticipated termination of our agreements with these customers or delay in shipments can affect our operating results adversely 
a relatively small number of customers have accounted for a significant portion of our net revenues in the past 
for fiscal  none of our customers represented more than of our sales 
in fiscal and  sales to future electronics  inc  a worldwide distributor  represented and  respectively  of our revenues 
in addition  we have experienced and may continue to experience lower margins on sales to significant customers as a result of volume pricing arrangements 
we also do not typically enter into long term contracts with our customers and we cannot be certain as to future order levels from our customers 
when we do enter into a long term contact  the contract is generally terminable at the convenience of the customer and it may be difficult to replace that source of revenues in the short term upon cancellation 
our business  operating results and financial condition could be materially adversely affected by the loss of one or more of our current customers  additional volume pricing arrangements  an early termination or delay in shipments by one of our major customers 
we have been unable to fulfill all our customers orders according to the schedule originally requested due to the constraints in our wafer supply 
due to the lead time constraints in our wafer supply  from time to time we have been unable to fulfill all our customers orders according to the schedule originally requested 
although we attempt to maintain an adequate supply of wafers and communicate to our customers delivery dates that we believe that we can reasonably expect to meet  our customers may not accept the alternative delivery date or may cancel their outstanding orders 
reductions in orders received or cancellation of outstanding orders would result in lower revenues and net income  excess inventories and increased inventory reserves 
our operating results have historically been and in future quarters may be adversely affected or otherwise fluctuate due to factors such as timing of new product introductions and announcements by us and our competitors  fluctuations in customer demand for our products  volatility in supply and demand affecting market prices generally such as the increases in supply of competitive products and significant declines in average selling prices experienced by us in recent fiscal years 
we rely upon our intellectual property and proprietary technology and may receive notices from time to time that allege we have infringed the intellectual property rights of others 
in the semiconductor industry  companies place extensive reliance upon their intellectual property and proprietary technology and it is typical for companies to receive notices from time to time that allege infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights of others 
for example  we were served with a complaint alleging that we are infringing the intellectual property rights of xicor 
we entered into a settlement agreement with xicor in june pursuant to which we received a license to manufacture the disputed products in exchange for certain royalty payments to xicor 
we may receive other notices and or become a party to proceedings alleging our infringement of intellectual property rights in the future 
such claims  if successful  could require us to pay royalties on previous sales of the products which are alleged to infringe 
additionally  in such event  we may not be able to obtain any required licenses of third party intellectual property rights or be able to obtain such licenses on commercially reasonable terms 
failure to obtain such a license in any event could require us to cease production of our products until we develop a non infringing design or process 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the cost of litigation of any such claim or resulting damage award 

table of contents our securities are traded in a limited market 
our common stock was traded on the nasdaq national market from may until it was delisted in august for sustained trading below the minimum level of per share required by the nasdaq national market for continued listing 
our stock was traded on the over the counter bulletin board market until september  when we listed on the nasdaq smallcap market 
we may reapply for nasdaq national market listing if and when our shares trade for an extended period above the level  but we are unable to ascertain the amount of time nasdaq will take to consider such application  if nasdaq will reply favorably to such application or  if additional information is requested  how much time and effort will be required on our part to adequately demonstrate and verify our qualifications 
our backlog may not result in future revenues  which may adversely affect our business 
due to possible customer changes in delivery schedules and cancellations of orders  our backlog at any particular date is not necessarily indicative of actual sales for any succeeding period 
a reduction of backlog during any particular period or the failure of our backlog to result in future revenues could harm our business 
our ability to operate successfully depends upon the continued service of certain key employees and the continued ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
our ability to operate successfully will depend  to a large extent  upon the continued service of certain key employees and the continued ability to attract and retain additional highly qualified personnel 
competition for such personnel  particularly for highly skilled design  process and test engineers  is intense and we may not be able to retain such personnel or attract other highly qualified personnel 
our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected by the loss of or failure to attract and retain any such highly qualified personnel 
we depend on manufacturers representatives and distributors to distribute our products 
we market and distribute our products primarily through manufacturers representatives and independent distributors 
our distributors typically offer competing products 
the distribution channels have been characterized by rapid change  including consolidations and financial difficulties 
our operating results could be materially adversely affected by the loss of one or more manufacturers representatives or distributors  or the decision by one or more distributors to reduce the number of our products offered by such distributors or to carry the product lines of our competitors 
we may not be able to expand our proprietary technology if we do not acquire rights to use key technologies  consummate potential acquisitions or investments or successfully integrate them with our business 
to expand our proprietary technologies  we may acquire or make investments in complementary businesses  technologies or products if appropriate opportunities arise 
we may be unable to identify suitable acquisition or investment candidates at reasonable prices or on reasonable terms or consummate transactions with such candidates  the failure of which could slow our growth strategy 
we may also have difficulty in acquiring licenses to use proprietary technologies of third parties to expand our product lines 
we may have difficulty integrating the acquired products  personnel or technologies of any acquisition we might make 
these difficulties could disrupt our ongoing business  distract our management and employees and increase our expenses 
a change of control may be delayed by resistive measures adopted by us 
our stockholder rights plan  which provides stockholders with certain rights to acquire shares of common stock in the event a third party acquires more than of our stock  our board s ability to issue blank check preferred stock without stockholder approval and our staggered terms for our directors  could have the effect of delaying or preventing a change in control of our company 

table of contents item a 
quantitative and quantitative disclosures about market risk interest rate risk 
we do not use derivative financial instruments in our investment portfolio 
our investment portfolio is generally comprised of u 
s 
government securities and cash deposits 
our policy is to place these investments in instruments that meet high credit quality standards and have maturities of less than two years with an overall average maturity of less than one year 
these securities are subject to interest rate risk and could decline in value if interest rates fluctuate 
due to the short duration of the securities in which we invest and conservative nature of our investment portfolio  we do not expect any material loss with respect to our investment portfolio 
foreign currency exchange rate risk 
the majority of our sales  costs of manufacturing  research and development and marketing expenses are transacted in us dollars 
accordingly  our net profitability is not currently subject to material foreign exchange rate fluctuations 
if the us dollar would have decreased in value against the thai baht and japanese yen  the two foreign currencies in which we incurred expenses in fiscal  our net profits before taxes for the year would have decreased 
gains and losses from such fluctuations have not been material to us to date
