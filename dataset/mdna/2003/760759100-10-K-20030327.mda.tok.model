item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations you should read the following discussion in conjunction with our consolidated financial statements and their notes contained in this annual report on form k 
financial objectives in january  we publicly announced our objectives for the year 
these objectives included the following increasing free cash flow by over 
growing revenue by to  with from price increases and 
to from volume growth 
generating earnings per share of to 
using free cash flow to enhance shareholder value by completing strategic acquisitions and repurchasing up to million of our stock 
business performance we exceeded all four of our financial objectives for despite a weak economy 
the economic slowdown which began in continued to negatively impact the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and non residential construction activity during volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity continued to weaken during despite the weakness we experienced in the aspects of our business noted above  our internal growth from core operations for was with from price increases and from volume growth 
during  we secured several long term franchise and municipal contracts 
we also benefited from the geographic mix of our business which favors high growth markets 
as a result  during we were able to exceed the internal growth objectives we established at the beginning of the year 
in addition to the impact of the economic slowdown discussed above  during our operating margins were also negatively impacted by increased costs for risk and health insurance  increased depreciation expense primarily associated with capital additions  and increased revenue from municipal contracts and transfer stations which have lower margins than our other lines of business 
this decrease in operating margins was partially offset by an increase in recycling commodity prices  a decrease in fuel costs and the termination of our operating lease facility 
during  we began a number of initiatives designed to increase efficiencies and reduce costs including the implementation of a number of management information systems such as route optimization  customer relationship tracking and equipment maintenance software 
we continued to realize benefits from these initiatives in notwithstanding the impact of the economic slowdown and the increase in certain expenses  our earnings per share for the year ended december  was  excluding a gain on sale of certain assets  which exceeded the objective we established at the beginning of the year 
we were also able to exceed our free cash flow objective for the year 
during our board of directors increased our previously authorized share repurchase program from million to million 
we used our free cash flow during to repurchase million shares of our common stock for million 
financial objectives our financial objectives for assume no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter specific guidance is as follows our goal is to generate free cash flow of approximately of net income 
we define free cash flow as cash provided by operating activities less purchases of property and equipment plus proceeds from the sale of equipment as presented in our consolidated statement of cash flows 
we anticipate using our free cash flow to repurchase shares of our common stock under our million share repurchase program approved by our board of directors in october we anticipate earnings per share of to  including an estimated 
of additional landfill costs associated with the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations  and a change in accounting associated with methane gas collection systems 
we anticipate internal growth from core operations to be to  with approximately to attributable to price increases and to attributable to volume growth 
business initiatives our business initiatives for are generally a continuation of those initiated in the prior two years and are dependent on standardizing our business processes and improving our systems 
ensuring that our people understand our initiatives and processes and are trained on our new systems is essential to the overall success of our initiatives 
our business initiatives for are as follows improve the quality of our revenue 
the first step in this process was completed in and included installing a standardized billing and operating system 
this system enables us to  among other things  stratify our customers to determine how our rates compare to current market pricing 
during  we implemented the second generation of this software which we call rsi rsi  our company s core business system  provides a variety of functionalities including customer service  dispatch  billing  sales analysis  account retention and route productivity analysis 
we currently monitor our return on investment by market place and are in the process of instituting a return on investment pricing model 
this model will eventually allow us to track our return on investment by customer 
during  we also implemented a customer relationship management system 
this system improves the productivity of our sales force by helping to establish marketing priorities and track sales leads 
it also tracks renewal periods for potential commercial  industrial and franchise contracts 
our focus during will be to ensure our sales force is properly trained on this system and using it as intended 
improve the productivity of our operations 
we have instituted a grid productivity program that enables us to benchmark the performance of our drivers 
in addition  in our larger markets  we use a route optimization program to minimize drive times and improve operational density 
during  we will continue to update our disposal optimization reviews 
these reviews determine which local disposal option maximizes our return on invested capital and cash flow 
improve fleet management and procurement 
in february  we selected dossier as our fleet management and procurement system 
among other features  this system will track parts inventories  generate automatic quantity order points and log all maintenance work 
it will allow us to capture and review information to ensure our preventive maintenance programs comply with manufacturers warranties 
in addition  the purchase order module within this system will allow us to cross reference purchasing information with our inventory 
we expect to have dossier implemented at all of our hauling and landfill operations by the end of enhance operational and financial reporting systems 
we currently have several initiatives underway aimed at improving our operational and financial reporting systems 
the overall goal of these initiatives is to provide us with detailed information  prepared in a consistent manner  that will allow us to quickly analyze and act upon trends in our business 
the most significant of these systems is our enterprise wide general ledger package 
we successfully converted all of our locations to lawson general ledger software in and we are currently in the process of converting all of our locations to lawson fixed asset software 
all of the system initiatives mentioned above will provide us with more consistent and detailed information  thus allowing us to make quicker and more informed business decisions 
in addition  during  all of our significant software applications were standardized and centralized at our data center in fort lauderdale  florida 
this standardization and centralization provides us with consolidated information concerning our operations across a variety of operational and financial disciplines 
it also significantly enhances our ability to execute our disaster recovery plan  if necessary 
expand our safety training programs 
as part of our ongoing emphasis on safe work practices and in light of the recent increase in insurance costs  we expanded our safety training programs in we have signed a multi year agreement with dupont safety resources to assist in successfully completing this initiative 
our business we are a leading provider of non hazardous solid waste collection and disposal services in the united states 
we provide solid waste collection services for commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers through collection companies in states 
we also own or operate transfer stations  solid waste landfills and recycling facilities 
we generate revenue primarily from our solid waste collection operations  and our remaining revenue is from landfill disposal services and other services  including recycling and compost  mulch and soil operations 
the following table reflects our total revenue by source for the years ended december   and in millions collection residential commercial industrial other total collection    transfer and disposal less intercompany transfer and disposal  net other total revenue    our revenue from collection operations consists of fees we receive from commercial  industrial  municipal and residential customers 
our residential and commercial collection operations in some markets are based on long term contracts with municipalities 
we generally provide industrial and commercial collection operations to individual customers under contracts with terms up to three years 
our revenue from landfill operations is from disposal or tipping fees charged to third parties 
in general  we integrate our recycling operations with our collection operations and obtain revenue from the sale of recyclable materials 
no one customer has individually accounted for more than of our consolidated revenue in any of the last three years 
the cost of our collection operations is primarily variable and includes disposal  labor  fuel and equipment maintenance costs 
we try to be more efficient by controlling the movement of waste streams from the point of collection through disposal 
during the three months ended december   approximately of the total volume of waste we collected was disposed of at landfills we own or operate 
our landfill cost of operations includes daily operating expenses  costs of capital for cell development  accruals for closure and post closure costs  and the legal and administrative costs of ongoing environmental compliance 
we expense all indirect landfill development costs as they are incurred 
we use life cycle accounting and the units of consumption method to recognize certain direct landfill costs 
in life cycle accounting  certain direct costs are capitalized or accrued  and charged to expense based upon the consumption of cubic yards of available airspace 
these costs include all costs to acquire  construct  close and maintain a site during the post closure period 
cost and airspace estimates are developed annually by independent engineers together with our engineers 
these estimates are used by our operating and accounting personnel to annually adjust our rates used to expense capitalized costs and accrue closure and post closure costs 
changes in these estimates primarily relate to changes in available airspace  inflation and applicable regulations 
changes in available airspace include changes in design and changes due to the addition of airspace lying in expansion areas that we believe has a probable likelihood of being permitted 
critical accounting policies and disclosures our consolidated financial statements have been prepared using accounting principles generally accepted in the united states and necessarily include certain estimates and judgments made by management 
in the past  we significantly expanded our accounting disclosures in a number of areas that require subjective or complex judgments including landfill accounting  fixed assets and the activity in various balance sheet accounts such as closure and post closure accruals  self insurance reserves and allowance for doubtful accounts 
as part of our continuing commitment to reliable and transparent financial reporting that allows the users of our financial statements to make more informed decisions  we have prepared the following list of accounting policies that we believe are the most critical in understanding our company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows  and may require management to make subjective or complex judgments about matters that are inherently uncertain 
the following policies related to our landfill accounting are effective through december  on january   certain of our policies will change upon the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no

revision of the estimated useful life of long lived assets or whether the remaining balance of these assets should be evaluated for possible impairment 
we use an estimate of the undiscounted cash flow over the remaining life of the assets in assessing their recoverability 
in addition  goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if indicators of impairment arise 
in testing for impairment  we estimate the fair value of each operating segment of our business and compare the fair values with the carrying values 
we measure impairment loss as the amount by which the carrying amount of the asset or operating segment exceeds its fair value 
business combinations we make decisions to acquire or invest in businesses based on financial and strategic considerations 
businesses acquired are accounted for under the purchase method of accounting and are included in our consolidated financial statements from the date of acquisition 
we acquired various solid waste businesses during the year ended december  the aggregate purchase price we paid for these transactions was million 
we acquired various solid waste businesses during the year ended december  the aggregate purchase price we paid for these transactions was million 
the aggregate purchase price paid  less cash and restricted cash acquired plus debt assumed  was million 
in july  we entered into a definitive agreement with allied waste industries to acquire certain solid waste assets 
in  we had completed the purchase of these assets for approximately million in cash  million of which were acquired during in october  we entered into a definitive agreement with allied for the simultaneous purchase and sale of certain other solid waste assets 
in  we and allied had completed the purchase and sale of these assets of which annual revenue was approximately million 
our net proceeds from the cash portion of the exchange of assets were million 
all of these transactions have been accounted for under the purchase method of accounting 
in addition to the acquisitions from allied  we also acquired various other solid waste businesses during the year ended december  the aggregate purchase price we paid in these transactions was million in cash 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for acquisitions totaled approximately million 
as of december  we had intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of  million  which consist primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired 
during  million of the total purchase price paid for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace 
as of december   we had  million of landfill development costs which includes purchase price allocated to landfill airspace as well as other capitalized landfill costs 
when a landfill is acquired as part of a group of assets  purchase price is allocated to airspace based upon the discounted expected future cash flows of the landfill relative to the other assets within the acquired group and is adjusted for other non depletable landfill assets and liabilities acquired primarily closure and post closure liabilities 
landfill purchase price is amortized using the units of consumption method over total available airspace which includes probable expansion airspace where appropriate 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for acquisitions totaled approximately million 
as of december   we had intangible assets  net of accumulated amortization  of  million  which consists primarily of the cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired 
in addition  during  million of the total purchase price for acquisitions and contingent payments to former owners was allocated to landfill airspace 
cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired for acquisitions totaled approximately million

operating income revenue 
revenue was  million   million and  million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
revenue increased by million  or  from to revenue increased by million  or  from to the following table reflects the components of our revenue growth for the years ended december   and core price recycling commodities 
total price 
core volume non core volume 

total volume total internal growth acquisitions 
taxes a 
total revenue growth a represents new taxes levied on landfill volumes in certain states that are passed on to customers 
the economic slowdown which began in continued to negatively impact the portion of our business servicing the manufacturing sector and non residential construction industry during volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity continued to weaken during the weakness in our business attributable to the economic slowdown was partially offset by an increase in recycling commodity prices in the early part of despite the weakness we experienced in the aspects of our business noted above  our internal growth from core operations for was 
during  we secured several long term franchise and municipal contracts 
we also benefited from the geographic mix of our business which favors high growth markets 
during the first and second quarters of  our revenue was negatively impacted by weakness in recycling commodity prices 
in addition  during the second quarter of  we began to see a slowdown in revenue from the manufacturing sector  particularly in the midwestern and mid atlantic states 
during the third quarter of  the economic slowdown began to impact our industrial business servicing the non residential construction industry 
landfill volumes attributable to manufacturing and construction activity began to weaken 
in addition  the slowdown we began to experience in the second quarter in the manufacturing sector became more acute as we experienced significant shift reductions and plant closings in the southeastern united states  particularly in the textile and home furnishing industries in the carolinas 
these conditions were reflected in our internal growth numbers  which were approximately half of what we experienced in prior quarters 
during the fourth quarter of  we continued to see a weakening in waste volumes from the manufacturing sector 
we also continued to see a slowdown in commercial construction and special waste activity which resulted in both volume reductions and price sensitivity for these services 
furthermore  we began to see a softening in residential construction activity 
we anticipate internal growth from core operations to be to during assuming no deterioration or improvement in the overall economy from that experienced during the fourth quarter of however  our price and volume growth may remain flat or may decline in depending upon the severity and duration of the economic slowdown 
cost of operations 
cost of operations was  million   million and  million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in aggregate dollars from to is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million on an after tax basis  or million on a pre tax basis 
of this pre tax amount  million was recorded to cost of operations which relates primarily to the downsizing of our compost  mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments and an increase in self insurance reserves 
excluding the impact of this charge  cost of operations for was  million  or as a percent of revenue 
the increase in adjusted cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily the result of the economic slowdown  higher costs for risk and health insurance  and increased revenue from municipal contracts and transfer stations which have higher operating costs 
these increases in cost of operations were partially offset by improved operating efficiencies  higher recycling commodity prices  lower fuel costs and the termination of our operating lease facility 
the increase in aggregate dollars from to is primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth 
the increase in cost of operations as a percentage of revenue from to  excluding the impact of the charge recorded in the fourth quarter of  is primarily a result of the economic slowdown  lower recycling commodity prices  higher labor costs and higher costs for risk and health insurance partially offset by improved operating efficiencies and revenue mix 
in addition  during the third quarter of we continued to be successful in attracting municipal customers  however  these customers generally produce lower margins than other customers 
to date in  we have experienced a significant increase in fuel prices 
we believe that cost of operations as a percentage of revenue may continue to remain high or increase further depending upon the cost of fuel  health insurance  risk insurance and other key components of our cost structure and the severity and duration of the economic slowdown 
depreciation  amortization and depletion of property and equipment 
depreciation  amortization and depletion expenses for property and equipment were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in aggregate dollars for all periods presented is primarily due to acquisitions and capital expenditures 
the increase as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to higher depreciation expense resulting from capital expenditures  acquisitions and the purchase of equipment originally placed into service pursuant to an operating lease 
the decrease as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to lower depletion expense at our landfills resulting from higher compaction and more cost efficient cell construction 
amortization of intangible assets 
intangible assets consist primarily of cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired  but also includes values assigned to long term contracts and covenants not to compete 
expenses for amortization of intangible assets were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in aggregate dollars and as a percent of revenue from to is due to the adoption of statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets  effective january  under which most of our intangible assets are no longer subject to amortization 
the increase in aggregate dollars and as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to an increase in the aggregate dollar amount of acquisitions accounted for using the purchase method of accounting 
selling  general and administrative expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses were million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increases in aggregate dollars are primarily a result of the expansion of our operations through acquisitions and internal growth 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million on an after tax basis  or million on a pre tax basis 
of this pre tax amount  million was recorded to selling  general and administrative expenses which relates primarily to an increase in bad debt expense resulting from the economic slowdown 
excluding the impact of this charge  selling  general and administrative expenses for were million  or as a percent of revenue  which is consistent with the increase in selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue from to is primarily due to the strengthening of our regional management structure and various systems and training initiatives 
we believe that selling  general and administrative expenses in the range of of revenue is appropriate for given our business platform 
however  selling  general and administrative expenses as a percentage of revenue may increase depending upon the severity and duration of the economic slowdown 
other charges 
during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a million gain on the sale of certain assets for amounts exceeding estimates originally made during the fourth quarter of during the fourth quarter of  we recorded a charge of million on an after tax basis  or million on a pre tax basis 
of this pre tax amount  million was recorded to other charges which relates primarily to completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and non core businesses and asset impairments 
other charges were million for the year ended december  these charges relate primarily to the early closure of a landfill in south texas 
operating income 
operating income was million  million and million  or  as a percentage of revenue   and  for the years ended december   and  respectively 
excluding the impact of the other charges income we recorded in the fourth quarters of and  our operating income was million  or  and million  or  for the years ended december  and  respectively 
interest expense 
we incurred interest expense on our revolving credit facility  unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds 
interest expense was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the decrease in interest expense is due to a general market decrease in interest rates and an increase in tax exempt financings which generally bear interest at lower rates than our unsecured notes 
the decrease in interest expense is also due to interest rate swap agreements that we entered into during and capitalized interest was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
interest and other income expense  net 
interest and other income  net of other expense  was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the variances during the periods are primarily due to fluctuations in cash balances on hand and related interest income and net gains on the disposition of assets during and income taxes 
our provision for income taxes was million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
our effective income tax rate was  and for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the increase in our effective tax rate from to is the result of certain non tax deductible items included in the charge that we recorded during the fourth quarter of excluding the impact of this charge  our effective tax rate for was 
consolidated results of operations 
our net income for the year ended december  was million 
our adjusted net income was million for the year ended december  our adjusted operating results exclude a million pre tax  or a million after tax  gain we recorded during the fourth quarter of on the sale of certain assets for amounts exceeding estimates originally made during the fourth quarter of landfill and environmental matters among our most significant investments and most valuable assets are our landfills 
the additional disclosures included in this section provide the users of our financial statements with a clearer understanding of our investment in our landfills and various accounting principles that are unique to landfill operations

changes in design typically include significant modifications to a landfill s footprint or vertical slopes 
during  we actively pursued obtaining landfill permits which resulted in adding over twice as much permitted airspace during the year than was consumed 
during  total available airspace increased by million cubic yards primarily due to changes in design partially offset by consumption 
during  total available airspace increased by million cubic yards primarily due to the opening of a greenfield site in south carolina  and changes in engineering estimates partially offset by consumption 
as of december   we owned or operated solid waste landfills with total available disposal capacity estimated to be billion in place cubic yards 
total available disposal capacity represents the sum of estimated permitted airspace plus an estimate of probable expansion airspace 
these estimates are developed annually by independent engineers together with our engineers utilizing information provided by annual aerial surveys 
as of december   total available disposal capacity is estimated to be billion in place cubic yards of permitted airspace plus 
billion in place cubic yards of probable expansion airspace 
before airspace included in an expansion area is determined to be probable expansion airspace and  therefore  included in our calculation of total available disposal capacity  it must meet our expansion criteria 
see note  accrued landfill  environmental and legal costs of the notes to our consolidated financial statements for further information 
as of december   twenty of our landfills meet the criteria for including probable expansion airspace in their total available disposal capacity 
at projected annual volumes  these twenty landfills have an estimated remaining average site life of years  including probable expansion airspace 
the average estimated remaining life of all of our landfills is years 
as of december   five of our landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had obtained approval from local authorities and are proceeding into the state permitting process 
also  as of december   nine of our twenty landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace had submitted permit applications to state authorities 
the remaining six landfills that meet the criteria for including expansion airspace are in the process of obtaining approval from local authorities and have not identified any fatal flaws or impediments associated with the expansions at either the local or state level 
closure and post closure costs the following table reflects our closure and post closure expense per cubic yard of airspace consumed for the years ended december   and closure and post closure expense in millions cubic yards of airspace consumed in millions closure and post closure expense per cubic yard 


as of december   accrued closure and post closure costs were million 
the current portion of these costs of million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in other current liabilities 
the long term portion of these costs of million is reflected in our consolidated balance sheets in accrued landfill  environmental and legal costs 
as of december   assuming that all available landfill capacity is used  we expect to expense approximately million of additional closure and post closure costs over the remaining lives of our facilities 
our estimates for closure and post closure do not take into account discounts for the present value of total estimated costs 
if total estimated costs were discounted to present value  they would be lower

as of december   we expect to spend an estimated additional  million on existing landfills  primarily related to cell construction and environmental structures  over their expected remaining lives 
our total expected gross investment  excluding non depletable land  estimated to be billion  or per cubic yard  is used in determining our depletion and amortization expense based upon airspace consumed using the units of consumption method 
our estimates for expected future investment in landfills do not take into account inflation or discounts for the present value of total estimated costs 
for further information  see closure and post closure costs 
we accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities through a charge to income in the period such liabilities become probable and can be reasonably estimated 
we also accrue costs related to environmental remediation activities associated with properties acquired through business combinations as a charge to cost in excess of fair value of net assets acquired or landfill purchase price allocated to airspace  as appropriate 
no material amounts were charged to expense during the years ended december   and financial condition one of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple  cost effective and transparent capital structure 
at december   we had million of cash and cash equivalents 
we also had million of restricted cash  of which million relates to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financing that will be used to fund capital expenditures 
at december   we had million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financing outstanding at favorable interest rates 
in july  we entered into a billion unsecured revolving credit facility with a group of banks 
million of the credit facility was scheduled to expire in july and the remaining million was scheduled to expire in july as a result of our strong financial position and liquidity  in february we reduced the short and long term portions of our credit facility to million and million  respectively 
in july  we renewed the short and long term portions of our credit facility on substantially the same terms and conditions 
the short term portion of the facility expires in july and the long term portion expires in july borrowings under the credit facility bear interest at libor based rates 
we use our operating cash flow and proceeds from our credit facilities to finance our working capital  capital expenditures  acquisitions  share repurchases and other requirements 
as of december   we had million available under our credit facility 
in may  we sold million of unsecured notes in the public market 
million of these notes bear interest at per annum and mature in the remaining million bear interest at per annum and mature in interest on these notes is payable semi annually in may and november 
the million and million in notes were offered at a discount of million and 
million  respectively 
proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility 
in december  we entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles 
in july  we exercised our right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying million using our excess cash  which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time 
in august  we sold million of unsecured notes in the public market 
the notes bear interest at and mature in interest on these notes is payable semi annually in february and august 
the notes were offered at a discount of million 
proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility 
in order to manage risk associated with fluctuations in interest rates  in september and october  we entered into interest rate swap agreements with investment grade rated financial institutions 
the swap agreements have total notional values of million and million  respectively  and require our company to pay interest at floating rates based upon changes in libor and receive interest at fixed rates of and  respectively 
the swap agreements terminate in may and august  respectively 
at december   we had million of tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings outstanding of which approximately million was obtained during fiscal borrowings under these bonds and other financings bear interest based on fixed or floating interest rates at the prevailing market ranging from to at december  and have maturities ranging from to as of december   we had million of restricted cash related to proceeds from tax exempt bonds and other tax exempt financings 
this restricted cash will be used to fund capital expenditures under the terms of the agreements 
we plan to extend the maturity of our revolving short term credit facility prior to its expiration in july to july we believe that such an extension would provide us with sufficient financial resources to meet our anticipated capital requirements and obligations as they come due 
we believe that we would be able to raise additional debt or equity financing  if necessary  to fund special corporate needs or to complete acquisitions 
however  we cannot assure you that we would be able to obtain additional financing under favorable terms or to extend the existing short term credit facility on the same terms 
selected balance sheet accounts we were the first in our industry to provide the users of our financial statements with additional disclosures regarding selected balance sheet accounts 
these additional disclosures include schedules that show the activity in our available airspace  investment in landfills  property and equipment  and other selected balance sheet accounts 
we believe that these disclosures permit the readers of our financial statements to gain a better understanding of our company s financial condition  results of operations and cash flows

liquidity and capital resources the major components of changes in cash flows for the years ended december   and are discussed below 
cash flows from operating activities 
cash flows provided by operating activities were million  million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively 
the changes in cash provided by operating activities during the periods are due to the expansion of our business  deferred taxes and timing of receipts and payments from accounts receivable and accounts payable  respectively 
we use cash flow from operations to fund capital expenditures  acquisitions  share repurchases and debt repayments 
cash flows used in investing activities 
cash flows used in investing activities consist primarily of cash used for capital additions and business acquisitions 
cash used to acquire businesses  net of cash acquired  was million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
capital additions were million  million and million during the years ended december   and  respectively 
we intend to finance capital expenditures and acquisitions through cash on hand  cash flows from operations  our revolving credit facility  tax exempt bonds and other financings 
we expect to use primarily cash for future business acquisitions 
cash flows from used in financing activities 
cash flows provided by used in financing activities during the years ended december   and included commercial bank borrowings and repayments of debt in all three years  proceeds from our sale of unsecured notes in  and proceeds from issuances of tax exempt bonds in  and in august  we sold unsecured notes with a face value of million at a discounted price of million 
proceeds from the notes were used to repay our revolving credit facility 
in december  we entered into an operating lease facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles 
in july  we retired this facility using our excess cash 
during  and  our board of directors authorized the repurchase of up to million  million and million  respectively  of our common stock 
as of december   we paid million to repurchase approximately million shares of our stock  of which we paid million during to repurchase approximately million shares of our stock 
we intend to finance future stock repurchases through cash on hand  cash flow from operations  our revolving credit facility and other financings 
we used proceeds from our revolving credit facility  unsecured notes and tax exempt bonds to fund capital expenditures and acquisitions and to repay debt 
credit rating our company has received investment grade credit ratings 
as of december   our senior debt was rated baa by moody s  bbb by standard poor s and bbb by fitch 
one of our key financial objectives is to maintain our investment grade credit rating on our senior debt 
we believe that frequently communicating with our rating agencies and providing them with detailed information concerning our financial and operational performance is critical in achieving this objective 
the following table demonstrates our improvement in certain financial ratios as of and for the years ended december   and that we believe are important to our credit rating agencies adjusted a net debt to total capitalization net debt to ebitda b x x x x ebitda to interest expense b x x x x operating income to total assets a adjusted results for exclude an million after tax charge we recorded in the fourth quarter of related to the completed and planned divestitures and closings of certain core and non core businesses  asset impairments  downsizing our compost  mulch and soil business and related inventory adjustments  an increase in self insurance reserves and an increase in bad debt expense related to the economic slowdown 
b ebitda represents operating income plus depreciation  amortization and depletion 
while ebitda data should not be construed as a substitute for operating income  net income or cash flows from operations in analyzing our operating performance  financial position and cash flows  we have included ebitda data  which is not a measure of financial performance calculated in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states  because we believe that this data is commonly used by certain credit rating agencies to evaluate a company s financial performance 
due to the fact that not all companies calculate non gaap measures in the same manner  the ebitda presentation herein may not be comparable to similarly titled measures reported by other companies 
we believe that our investment grade rating from our credit rating agencies and the financial ratios above are indicative of the financial strength of our company 
operating lease facility one of our key financial objectives is to maintain a simple  cost effective and transparent capital structure 
as we previously disclosed in our quarterly and annual filings with the securities and exchange commission  in december  we entered into a million facility established to finance the acquisition of operating equipment consisting primarily of revenue producing vehicles 
the facility had a term of three years with two consecutive one year renewals and was entered into primarily because its implicit interest rate was over ten basis points less than our revolving credit facility at the time 
the facility met the criteria of an operating lease under generally accepted accounting principles 
accordingly  during the term of this facility  we did not record this facility as debt nor did we record the related operating equipment as assets on our balance sheets 
however  we included the cost of operating equipment acquired under the facility as capital expenditures for purposes of calculating our free cash flow 
in july  we exercised our right to purchase the equipment underlying this facility by paying million using our excess cash  which was the balance outstanding under the facility at that time 
as a result of our success in obtaining financing in the public markets  including tax exempt bonds  we do not anticipate using this form of financing again in the foreseeable future 
fuel hedge we have minimized our risk associated with changes in the price of diesel fuel by entering into derivatives with a group of financial institutions having investment grade ratings 
our derivative instruments qualify for hedge accounting treatment under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  as amended 
under these option agreements  we receive or make payments based on the difference between actual average heating oil prices and predetermined fixed prices 
these option agreements protect us from fuel prices rising above a predetermined fixed price in the option agreements  but also limit our ability to benefit from price decreases below the predetermined fixed price in the option agreements 
during june  we entered into option agreements for approximately million gallons of heating oil 
these option agreements settled each month in equal notional amounts through december the option agreements were structured as zero cost collars indexed to the price of heating oil 
the option agreements expired in december in accordance with sfas  million and million  net of tax  representing the effective portion of the change in fair value during the periods have been recorded in stockholders equity as a component of accumulated other comprehensive income loss for the years ended december  and  respectively 
the ineffective portions of the changes in fair value of approximately 
million and 
million for the years ended december  and  respectively  have been included in other income expense  net in the accompanying consolidated statements of income 
realized losses of 
million and 
million for the years ended december  and  respectively  related to these option agreements are included in cost of operations in our consolidated statements of income 
future obligations the following table summarizes our significant future obligations as of december  maturities of notes operating payable and closure and year ending december  leases long term debt post closure remediation total thereafter   total   quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the table below provides information about our market sensitive financial instruments and constitutes a forward looking statement

average interest rates interest rate swaps amount outstanding in millions average interest rates the fair value of variable rate debt approximates the carrying value since interest rates are variable and  thus  approximate current market rates 
seasonality our operations can be adversely affected by periods of inclement weather which could delay the collection and disposal of waste  reduce the volume of waste generated or delay the construction or expansion of our landfill sites and other facilities 
new accounting pronouncements in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement is effective for financial statements issued for fiscal years beginning after june  and applies to all legally enforceable obligations associated with the retirement of tangible long lived assets 
sfas will require our company to change the methodology we currently use to record closure and post closure costs related to our landfills 
the most significant change to our methodology promulgated by this statement is inflating and discounting obligations to reflect today s dollars 
sfas does not change the basic landfill accounting policies followed by us and others in the waste industry 
in general  the industry has amortized capitalized costs and accrued future closure and post closure obligations using the units of consumption method as cubic yards of available airspace are consumed over the life of the related landfill 
this practice is referred to as life cycle accounting and will continue to be followed except as modified by sfas as discussed below 
under sfas  obligations associated with final capping activities that occur during the operating life of the landfill will be recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed within each discrete capping event 
obligations related to closure and post closure activities that occur after the landfill has ceased operations will be recognized on a units of consumption basis as airspace is consumed throughout the entire landfill 
landfill retirement obligations will be capitalized as the related liabilities are recognized and amortized using the units of consumption method over the airspace consumed within the capping event or the airspace consumed throughout the entire landfill  depending upon the nature of the obligation 
all obligations will be initially measured at estimated fair value 
fair value will be calculated on a present value basis using the company s credit adjusted  risk free rate 
upon adopting sfas  the company will no longer record closure and post closure expense as a component of cost of operations 
instead  amortization expense will be recorded on the capitalized portion of the obligation and accretion expense will be recorded using the effective interest method 
the table below reflects significant changes between our current methodology and the methodology we will use upon adopting sfas practice upon adoption of description current practice sfas no 
definitions final capping costs related to installation of no change 
the components that comprise the permanent final cover over areas of a landfill where airspace capacity has been consumed 
closure includes routine maintenance no change  except that it will costs incurred after a site include the final portion of the ceases to accept waste  but methane gas collection system to prior to being certified closed

we will adopt sfas no 
beginning january  and  based on current estimates  will record an after tax expense of approximately million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
in addition  beginning january   we will modify our accounting for methane gas collection systems and  based on current estimates  will record an after tax expense of approximately million as a cumulative effect of a change in accounting principle 
we expect that the impact of adopting sfas no 
and changing our accounting for methane gas collection systems in will decrease earnings per share in the range of 
to 
per share 
the adoption of sfas no 
will have no net effect on our cash flow 
in july  the financial accounting standards board issued statement no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
sfas no 
addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  such as restructurings  involuntarily terminating employees and consolidating facilities initiated after december  the implementation of sfas no 
is not expected to have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows
