see forward looking information 
we undertake no obligation to publicly release any revisions to any forward looking statement in this discussion to reflect events and circumstances occurring after the date of this prospectus or to reflect unanticipated events 
overview we provide equipment as well as technical and administrative services to physicians  hospitals  and surgery centers performing lithotripsy and orthotripsy extracorporeal shock wave surgery 
we were formed in december and began offering lithotripsy services in in october  we received fda approval to market an orthopaedic extracorporeal shock wave surgery device  the ossatron  and since then we have invested significant resources in developing our orthopaedic services network while expanding our lithotripsy operations 
our services are provided principally through limited partnerships or other entities that we manage which use lithotripsy devices or the ossatron orthopaedic shock wave device 
many of these partnerships were formed by us  and we have retained an equity interest ranging from to while selling any remaining interests to physicians 
we generally retain the sole general partnership interest in the partnerships and manage their daily operations 
we also provide equipment maintenance services to the partnerships and supply them with various consumables used in lithotripsy and orthotripsy extracorporeal shock wave surgery procedures 
to date we have expanded our operations by forming partnerships in new geographic markets and acquiring interests in partnerships from third parties  and we expect to continue to do so in the future 
as a result of the control we exert over the partnerships by virtue of our sole general partnership interest  management contract and otherwise  for financial reporting purposes we consolidate the results of operations of the partnerships with our own even though we own less than all and in many cases less than of their outstanding equity interests 
we reflect the equity of third party partners in the partnerships results of operations in our consolidated statements of income and on our consolidated balance sheet as minority interest 
in certain instances  we do not control partnerships or other entities in which we have ownership interests 
we account for our interests in these entities either on the equity or cost basis  depending on the degree of influence we exert over the entity 
we recognize revenue in our consolidated statements of income from the following three principal sources fees for clinical services provided by the partnerships 
a substantial majority of our consolidated revenues are derived from technical fees relating to treatments performed using our equipment and related services 
we bill for these fees under two different models 
under the wholesale billing model  we charge a fee to the hospital or other surgery center at which the treatment is performed 
our fee might be a set fee per procedure  a set fee per month based on a specified number of days of service at the facility per month  or set as a percentage of revenue derived 
under the retail billing model  we charge the patient s insurer  hmo or other responsible party  and we pay a fee to the health care facility for access to its premises 
under either model  the professional fee payable to the physician performing the procedure is generally billed and collected by the physician 
the billing and collection cycle for wholesale fees is typically significantly shorter than for retail fees  although the gross margin for retail billing is moderately higher than for wholesale billing 
technical services  equipment maintenance and sale of consumables to unaffiliated third parties 
we charge fees to unaffiliated third parties who own or operate lithotripsy devices for equipment maintenance  technical support and related services 
we also sell a variety of consumables used in lithotripsy and orthopaedic extracorporeal shock wave surgery procedures to unaffiliated third parties 
equipment sales to third parties 
to a limited extent  we generate revenue from the sale of shock wave devices to third parties 
historically  our revenue was derived primarily from service fees and the sale of lithotripsy devices and related consumables 
we have implemented a strategy of structuring our operations to focus on revenues from treatment fees  which generate significantly greater operating margins 
as the percentage of our revenue attributable to treatment fees has increased  we have become more dependent  both directly in the case of retail billing and indirectly in the case of wholesale billing  on the reimbursement policies of governmental and private third party payors 
while the reimbursement status of lithotripsy is well established  orthopaedic extracorporeal shock wave surgery is a relatively new procedure in the us  and the reimbursement policies of third party payors for this treatment are still developing 
our results of operations could be significantly affected by changes in reimbursement policies regarding lithotripsy or by decisions made regarding the reimbursement status of orthotripsy extracorporeal shock wave surgery 
we completed several acquisitions in that significantly expanded our operations 
in may we acquired heritage medical services of texas  inc and hsc of gulf coast  inc 
for  in cash 
these entities provided lithotripsy operations similar to our own and recorded net revenues in of million 
in december we acquired litho group  inc for million in cash 
we financed this purchase with borrowings under a credit facility established at the time of the acquisition 
litho group  inc  which also provided lithotripsy services similar to our own  had net revenues in of million and net revenues in through the date of acquisition of million 
each of these acquisitions was accounted for as a purchase  and consequently the results of operations of the acquired companies are included in our own since the date of their respective acquisitions 
see note of the notes to consolidated financial statements 
historically our business has consisted primarily of lithotripsy equipment sales and  more recently  patient treatments 
in october we received fda approval to market our orthotripsy extracorporeal shock wave device for the treatment of plantar fasciitis 
since then we have been engaged in an active program of forming orthopaedic services partnerships  selling interests in these partnerships to physicians and other activities designed to promote this new orthopaedic treatment modality 
on march   we received fda approval to market our orthopaedic shock wave device for the treatment of lateral epicondylitis or tennis elbow 
results of consolidated operations year ended december  compared to year ended december  net revenue net revenue increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   an increase of 
this increase is primarily attributable to the increase in clinical treatment revenues generated as a result of the acquisition of heritage medical services of texas  inc  hsc of gulf coast  inc  and litho group  inc and  to a lesser extent  to the increase in clinical treatment revenues generated by orthopaedic and urology partnerships over cost of devices  service parts and consumables cost of devices  service parts and consumables increased from  for the year ended december  to  for the year ended december   an increase of

all significant intercompany accounts and transactions have been eliminated in consolidation 
see note to the financial statements for discussion of minority interests 
quarterly statement of earnings data the following table presents certain quarterly statement of earnings data for the years ended december  and the quarterly statement of earnings data set forth below was derived from our unaudited financial statements and includes all adjustments  consisting of normal recurring adjustments  which we consider necessary for a fair presentation thereof 
results of operations for any particular quarter are not necessarily indicative of results of operations for a full year or predictive of future periods 
quarterly statement of earnings data q q q q q q q q revenues       earnings  before income taxes     net income     diluted earnings per common share earnings per common share amounts are calculated on a quarterly basis and may not total to the annual amount 
critical accounting policies our consolidated financial statements are based on the selection and application of accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america  which require us to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in our financial statements and the accompanying notes 
future events and their effects cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgment 
estimates and assumptions are reviewed periodically and the effects of the revisions are reflected in the consolidated financial statements in the period they are determined to be necessary 
actual results could differ from those estimates  and any such differences may be material to the financial statements 
if different assumptions or conditions were to prevail  the results could be materially different from our reported results 
consolidation our consolidated financial statements include the accounts of those significant subsidiaries that we control 
they also include our undivided interests in these subsidiaries assets and liabilities 
amounts representing our percentage interest in the underlying net assets of other significant affiliates that we do not control  but over which we exercise significant influence  are included in investments in unconsolidated entities  our share of the net income of these companies is included in the consolidated statement of income caption equity in earnings of unconsolidated entities 
the accounting for these non consolidated companies is referred to as the equity method of accounting 
our investments in other companies that we do not control and for which we do not have the ability to exercise significant influence as discussed above are carried at cost or fair value  as appropriate 
revenue recognition  gain recognition and allowance for doubtful accounts net revenue includes treatment fees for medical devices in the clinical setting 
treatment revenue is primarily wholesale or retail 
wholesale revenue is generated primarily from fixed fee contracts with various medical facilities and is recorded in the month the related treatments are performed 
retail revenue  generated when we bill third party payors for medical facility and technical fees  is recorded at the time services are rendered 
these third party billings may or may not be contractual 
adjustments which reduce revenue from established contractual or estimated non contractual billing rates to amounts estimated to be reimbursable are recognized in the period the services are rendered 
differences in estimates recorded and final settlements are reported during the period final settlements are made 
we may sell medical devices to certain entities in which we have an interest and may have guaranteed a portion of the long term obligations related to such purchases 
we eliminate profits on such transactions where the purchaser is a consolidated subsidiary of ours 
a pro rata portion of the profit will be deferred on sales to unconsolidated subsidiaries where we have accounted for our investment interest using the equity or cost basis methods of accounting depending on our ability to exercise significant influence over the operating and financial policies of the joint venture 
revenue is recognized upon delivery at the customer s destination for sales of medical devices to unaffiliated entities 
for miscellaneous sales of consumables  revenue is recognized at the time of shipment by the company 
revenue generated from service contracts is recognized ratably over the life of the related contract 
we form wholly owned limited partnerships in which we are the general partner and then contribute a medical device to the partnership 
we may sell interests in these partnerships to physicians or other investors 
we generally recognize a gain on the interest sold as non operating income at the time the subscription agreement is signed 
certain gains on the sale of partnership interests are deferred when payment terms exceed one year 
in order to record our accounts receivable at their net realizable value  we must assess their collectibility 
a considerable amount of judgment is required in order to make this assessment including the analysis of historical bad debts and other adjustments  a review of the aging of our receivables and the current creditworthiness of our customers 
we have recorded allowances for receivables which we feel are uncollectible  including amounts for the resolution of potential credit and other collection issues 
however  depending upon how such potential issues are resolved  or if the financial condition of any of our customers was to deteriorate and their ability to make required payments became impaired  increases in these allowances may be required 
inventory we are required to state our inventories at the lower of cost or market 
our inventories include medical devices  parts for servicing the medical equipment we sell and consumables for the medical equipment we use 
we continually evaluate the inventory for excess and obsolescence 
at this time we believe that no inventory reserve is required to reduce the carrying value of our inventory to its net realizable value 
however  if the demand for our product were to decline we might be required to establish such reserves 
long lived assets we have recorded property  plant and equipment and intangible assets at cost less accumulated depreciation and amortization 
the determination of useful lives and whether or not these assets are impaired involves significant judgment 
we review long lived assets  including intangible assets and goodwill for impairment annually  or sooner whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying amounts of such assets may not be recoverable 
goodwill is the excess of the purchase price over the fair value of identifiable net assets acquired in business combinations accounted for as purchases 
goodwill and certain other intangible assets having indefinite lives  which were previously amortized on a straight line basis over the periods benefited  are no longer being amortized to earnings  but instead are subject to periodic testing for impairment 
intangible assets determined to have definite lives are amortized over their remaining useful lives 
goodwill of a reporting unit is tested for impairment on an annual basis or between annual tests if an event occurs or circumstances change that would reduce the fair value of a reporting unit below its carrying amount 
income taxes we account for income taxes in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for income taxes 
under this method  deferred tax assets and liabilities are determined based on differences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and liabilities 
they are measured using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in effect when the differences are expected to be recovered or settled 
we regularly review our deferred tax assets for recoverability and establish a valuation allowance based upon projected future taxable income and the expected timing of the reversals of existing temporary differences 
a valuation allowance is required when it is more likely than not that all or a portion of a deferred tax asset will not be realized 
based on our continued profitability  we have determined that it is likely that we will realize a portion of the deferred tax asset 
however  after consideration of several factors  including but not limited to the uncertainty and lack of visibility of future economic conditions  declining medical reimbursement and because the use of the asset will be spread over a number of future years  it is difficult for us to say with certainty that all of the asset will be realized 
therefore  we have established a valuation allowance for that portion of the deferred tax asset for which it is more likely than not that it will not be realized 
derivative instruments and hedging we manage risks associated with interest rates and we may use derivative instruments to hedge these risks 
as a matter of policy  we do not use derivative instruments unless there is an underlying exposure and  therefore  we do not use derivative instruments for trading or speculative purposes 
the evaluation of hedge effectiveness is subject to assumptions based on the terms and timing of the underlying exposures 
all derivative instruments are recognized in our consolidated balance sheet at fair value 
the fair value of our derivative instruments is generally based on quoted market prices 
related party transactions transactions between related parties occur in the normal course of business 
we provide services and products to our subsidiaries  our subsidiaries provide services and products to other subsidiaries 
we eliminate transactions with our consolidated subsidiaries and appropriately disclose other significant related party transactions 
recently issued accounting standards in july  the fasb issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets sfas  which establishes new rules on the accounting for goodwill and other intangible assets 
under sfas  goodwill and intangible assets with indefinite lives will no longer be amortized  however  they will be subject to annual impairment tests as prescribed by the statement 
intangible assets with definite lives will continue to be amortized over their estimated useful lives 
we adopted sfas effective january   however  the transition provisions of this statement preclude the amortization of goodwill acquired in a business combination for which the acquisition date is after june  in accordance with these transition provisions  we did not amortize the goodwill acquired through the acquisition of litho group  inc on december  see note 
we adopted the provision of sfas for our other goodwill effective january  sfas required companies with goodwill to complete an initial impairment test by june  the company completed the impairment test of its goodwill and did not identify an asset impairment as a result of the impairment test 
additionally  the company completed its periodic review of its goodwill for impairment as of december   and did not identify an asset impairment as a result of the review 
the company will continue to review its goodwill annually for impairment 
in october  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets sfas 
sfas establishes a single accounting model for the impairment of long lived assets  including discontinued operations 
sfas supersedes sfas no 
accounting for the impairment of long lived assets and for long lived assets to be disposed of and apb opinion no 
 reporting the results of operations reporting the effects of disposal of a segment of a business  and extraordinary  unusual and infrequently occurring events and transactions apb no 

we adopted this accounting standard effective january  there was no effect on our financial statements from this adoption

 accounting for leases  to eliminate an inconsistency between the required accounting for sale leaseback transactions and the required accounting for certain lease modifications that have economic effects that are similar to sale leaseback transactions 
the provisions of sfas no 
related to the recision of sfas no 
will be applied in fiscal years beginning after may  the provisions of sfas no 
related to sfas no 
is effective for transactions occurring after may   with early application encouraged 
all other provisions of sfas no 
are effective for financial statements issued on or after may   with early application encouraged 
the adoption of sfas no 
did not have an effect on our financial statements 
in july  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities sfas 
sfas addresses financial accounting and reporting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities and supercedes emerging issues task force issue no 
 liability recognition for certain employee termination benefits and other costs to exit an activity including certain costs incurred in a restructuring 
sfas requires that a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
the provisions of this statement are effective for exit or disposal activities that are initiated after december  we do not expect there to be a material impact on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows as a result of adopting this accounting standard 
in november  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
this interpretation will significantly change current practice in the accounting for and disclosure of guarantees 
guarantees meeting the characteristics described in the interpretation are required to be initially recorded at fair value  which is different from the general current practice of recording a liability only when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable 
the interpretation s initial recognition and initial measurement provisions are applicable on a prospective basis to guarantees issued or modified after december  the interpretation also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures for virtually all guarantees even if the likelihood of the guarantor s having to make payments under the guarantee is remote 
the interpretation s disclosure requirements are effective for this year s financial statements 
in january  the fasb issued interpretation no 
 consolidation of variable interest entities 
many variable interest entities have commonly been referred to as special purpose entities or off balance sheet structures  but this interpretation applies to a larger population of entities 
in general  a variable interest entity is any legal structure used for business purposes that either does not have equity investors with voting rights or has equity investors that do not provide sufficient financial resources for the entity to support its activities 
a variable interest entity often holds financial assets  including loans or receivables  real estate or other property 
until now  one company generally has included another entity in its consolidated financial statements only if it controlled the entity through voting interests 
this interpretation changes that by requiring a variable interest entity to be consolidated by a company if that company is subject to a majority of the risk of loss from the variable interest entity s activities or entitled to receive a majority of the entity s residual returns or both 
the consolidation requirements of this interpretation apply to variable interest entities created after january  and apply to existing variable interest entities in the first fiscal year or interim period beginning after june  we have not determined the effect of adopting this interpretation 
liquidity and capital resources we have funded our working capital requirements and capital expenditures from net cash provided by operating activities and borrowings under bank credit facilities 
in conjunction with the purchase of litho group  inc  we obtained a  credit facility 
at december  and  we had  and  respectively  outstanding under the credit facility and additional debt primarily at the subsidiary level 
included in the credit facility is a  line of credit under which  was available at december  debt at the subsidiary level is typically related to equipment purchased and operated by that subsidiary and is secured by that equipment 
cash and cash equivalents increased from  at december  to  at december  it is our intention to use the after tax cash proceeds received from the sales of lithotripsy partnership interests to reduce our existing debt as has been done with the proceeds from sales since january  net cash provided by operating activities increased from  in to  in as a result of an increase in earnings before depreciation  amortization and minority interest 
included in the increase in accrued expenses and other liabilities is a  liability related to cash received pending the sale of lithotripsy partnership interests 
this sale of partnership interests was completed in the first quarter of net cash used in investing activities was  in compared to  in the investment activity in included approximately  used in the acquisition of litho group  inc  while the investment activity included approximately  provided by the sale of us lithotripsy  us net cash of  was provided by financing activities primarily for the financing of the litho group  inc lgi acquisition compared to the  net cash used by financing activities including approximately  used to pay down debt related to the purchase of lgi 
net cash provided by operating activities for was  compared to  for this increase was primarily the result of increased earnings before depreciation and amortization and minority interest 
net cash used in investing activities was  in compared to  in the increase in was due primarily to the purchase of businesses and increased capital expenditures 
net cash provided by financing activities aggregated  in and  in and consisted primarily of proceeds form short term borrowings and long term debt offset by principal payments on short term borrowings and long term debt 
our capital expenditures totaled approximately  in  primarily for the purchase of mobile medical equipment put in service 
we currently estimate that our capital expenditures will total approximately  to  in for the purchase of additional medical equipment for our consolidated subsidiaries  which may be secured by additional debt at the related partnership 
we believe that we will more likely than not be able to realize the benefit of  of the total current and non current deferred tax assets  based on our expected future income  our historical income and our understanding of current market trends 
for the remaining  in deferred tax assets  we have established a valuation allowance 
the deferred tax assets relate primarily to our acquisition of lgi 
as such  future realizations of those assets will be recorded as a reduction to goodwill 
partnership interest sales could result in a reduction of future earnings  however  we believe that our cash generated from operations and borrowings under our revolving credit facility will be sufficient to meet our liquidity and capital spending needs at least through the end of this and other significant contractual obligations are as follows payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years years after years short term borrowings   long term debt     capital lease obligations    operating leases     purchase obligations    total contractual cash obligations   pursuant to our distribution agreement with hmt we have an ongoing commitment to purchase certain medical devices 
based upon current market prices  this commitment is approximately million in cautionary statements included in this report are forward looking statements that reflect management s current outlook for future periods 
as always  these expectations and projections are based on currently available competitive  financial  and economic data  along with operating plans  and are subject to future events and uncertainties  including those uncertainties identified under the caption risk factors in item of this report 
item a quantitative and qualitative disclosure about market risk we are subject to market risk from exposure to changes in interest rates on our variable rate debt 
although there can be no assurances that interest rates will not change significantly  we do not expect changes in interest rates to have a material effect on income or cash flows in as of december   and  our corporate level fixed rate debt was  and million  and our corresponding corporate level variable rate debt was million  million and million 
based on our variable rate debt at december   in the absence of the swaps discussed below  a one percent change in interest rates would result in an annual change in interest rate expense calculated on a simple interest basis of approximately  in order to protect the company from interest rate volatility  effective february   the company entered into two two year interest rate swap agreements the swaps  with a total notional amount of million at february  and million at december  the swaps effectively convert a portion of the company s floating rate debt to a fixed rate basis for the next two years  thus reducing the impact of interest rate changes on future interest expense 
the swaps qualify as cash flow hedges under statement of financial accounting standards no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities  and expire on february  the company believes that its hedge is effective with changes in fair value to be reported in other comprehensive income 
as of december  the market value of the derivatives was a liability of  which is included on the accompanying balance sheet  and the related comprehensive loss of  has been recorded 
the counterparties to the interest rate swap agreements are major commercial banks 
the company is exposed to counterparty credit risk for nonperformance and  in the event of nonperformance  to market risk for changes in interest rates 
the company does not anticipate nonperformance of the counterparties
