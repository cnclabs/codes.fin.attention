with these two acquisitions  trizetto obtained a customer base with more than million enrollees of the us insured population and attained a leadership position in two of its target markets  payers and benefits administrators 
financial information please refer to item  selected financial data  and item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  for a review of revenue  net loss  and total assets for the last three years 
our strategy rising healthcare costs are causing employers to shift more of the cost of healthcare benefits to employees 
in turn  employees are demanding better service from their health plans  more information about doctors  hospitals and other providers  and more help navigating the healthcare delivery system 
we believe that many health plans lack the technology and operational efficiency to operate in a more consumer driven environment 
our strategy is to provide the healthcare expertise  technology and services that our customers need today and in the future 
key elements of our strategy include help customers anticipate change and migrate toward a successful future 
in  we developed our vision of the future for three customer segments health plans  benefits administrators  and preferred provider organizations ppos 
we named these futures health plan  benefits administrator  and ppo has become the centerpiece of our sales strategy  supported by trizetto s comprehensive portfolio of solutions and a clear migration path for customers

sales and marketing our sales and marketing approach is to promote trizetto as the single source for comprehensive healthcare information technology products and services 
as of december   we had approximately sales and marketing employees throughout the united states 
our professional sales force  comprised of experienced sales executives with established track records  sells our entire range of offerings to current and prospective customers  including enterprise software  outsourced services  and consulting services 
separate sales teams have been established for the payer and benefits administration markets 
the sales team for the payer market is divided into national and middle market accounts 
we have payer sales support teams for enterprise software and for outsourced services 
the support teams are responsible for providing in depth technical information to the customer or prospect  providing product demonstrations  and for negotiating customer contracts 
to support the sales process  multi disciplinary pursuit teams are established for each major prospect  spearheaded by a member of executive management 
our marketing organization is organized by target market and is closely aligned with the sales force to provide market specific campaigns and lead generation initiatives for our enterprise software  outsourced services  and consulting 
these initiatives include direct mail campaigns  marketing collateral  trade shows  seminars and events 
the marketing organization also develops and supports our corporate positioning and branding  coordinates market research  and handles all tradeshows  customer conferences and events 
our consulting services group works closely with the sales organization to provide a consultative  executive selling approach that complements our sales program 
this team of healthcare information technology professionals is trained in a proprietary assessment methodology that allows a quick and comprehensive analysis of a customer s information technology capabilities and requirements 
in conjunction with their consulting responsibilities  our consulting services group identifies opportunities to introduce customers to the broad range of applications and technology solutions available to them  including those that we offer 
customer service we believe that a high level of support is necessary to maintain long term relationships with our customers 
an account manager is assigned to each of our customers and is responsible for proactively monitoring customer satisfaction  providing customers with additional training and process improvement opportunities  and coordinating issue resolution 
we employ functional and technical support personnel who work directly with our account management team and customers to resolve technical  operational and application problems or questions 
our service desk provides a wide range of customer support functions 
our customers may contact the service desk through a toll free number hours a day  seven days a week

because we support multiple applications and technology solutions  our functional and technical support staff are grouped and trained by specific application and by application type 
these focused staff groups have concentrated expertise that we can deploy as needed to address customer needs 
we cross train employees to support multiple applications and technology solutions to create economies of scale in our support staff 
we further leverage the capabilities of our support staff through the use of sophisticated software that tracks solutions to common computer and software related problems 
this allows our support staff to learn from the experience of other people within the organization and reduces the time it takes to solve problems 
in addition  we provide customer support for our business process outsourcing services 

table of contents competition the market for healthcare information technology services is intensely competitive  rapidly evolving  highly fragmented and subject to rapid technological change 
by using proprietary technologies and methods  we develop  integrate and deliver packaged software applications  internet connections  electronic communications infrastructure and it consulting services 
our competitors provide some or all of the services that we provide 
our competitors can be categorized as follows information technology and outsourcing companies  such as perot systems corporation  ibm  affiliated computer services  computer sciences corporation  and electronic data systems corporation  healthcare software application vendors  such as quality care solutions  inc  platinum equity  llc owns amisys and denovis  inc  healthcare information technology consulting firms  such as first consulting group  inc  superior consultant holdings corporation and the consulting divisions or former affiliates of the major accounting firms  such as deloitte consulting and accenture  healthcare e commerce and portal companies  such as webmd corporation  navimedix and healthtrio  and enterprise application integration vendors such as vitria  seebeyond  tibco  fuego and m each of these types of companies can be expected to compete with us within various segments of the healthcare information technology market 
furthermore  major software information systems companies and other entities  including those specializing in the healthcare industry that are not presently offering applications that compete with our products and services  may enter our markets 
in addition  some of our third party software vendors compete with us from time to time by offering their software on a licensed or hosted basis 
we believe companies in our industry primarily compete based on performance  price  software functionality  customer awareness  ease of implementation and level of service 
although our competitive position is difficult to characterize due principally to the variety of current and potential competitors and the evolving nature of our market  we believe that we presently compete favorably with respect to all of these factors 
while our competition comes from many industry segments  we believe no single segment offers the integrated  single source solution that we provide to our customers 
to be competitive  we must continue to enhance our products and services  as well as our sales  marketing and distribution channels to respond promptly and effectively to changes in the healthcare industry  including consolidation  constantly evolving standards and government regulation affecting healthcare transactions  the challenges of technological innovation and adoption  evolving business practices of our customers  our competitors new products and services  new products and services developed by our vendor partners and suppliers  and challenges in hiring and retaining information technology professionals 

table of contents backlog our total backlog is defined as the revenue we expect to generate in future periods from existing customer contracts 
our month backlog is defined as the revenue we expect to generate from existing customer contracts over the next months 
most of the revenue in our backlog is derived from multi year recurring revenue contracts including software hosting  business process outsourcing  it outsourcing  and software maintenance 
we classify revenue from software license and consulting contracts as non recurring 
such revenue is included in the backlog when the term of the software license or consulting contract exceeds months 
our total backlog at december   was approximately million 
the month backlog at december   was approximately million 
for a breakout of total and month backlog by recurring and non recurring revenue  see item  management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
backlog can change due to a number of factors  including unforeseen changes in implementation schedules  contract cancellations subject to penalties paid by the customer  or customer financial difficulties 
unless we enter into new customer agreements that generate enough revenue to replace or exceed the revenue that is recognized in any given quarter  our backlog will decline 
our backlog at any date may not indicate demand for our products and services and may not reflect actual revenue for any period in the future 
intellectual property our intellectual property is important to our business 
we rely on certain developed software assets and internal methodologies for performing customer services 
our consulting services group develops and utilizes information technology life cycle methodology and related paper based and software based toolsets to perform customer assessments  planning  design  development  implementation and support services 
we rely primarily on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
our efforts to protect our intellectual property may not be adequate 
our competitors may independently develop similar technology or duplicate our products or services 
unauthorized parties may infringe upon or misappropriate our products  services or proprietary information 
in addition  the laws of some foreign countries do not protect proprietary rights as well as the laws of the united states 
in the future  litigation may be necessary to enforce our intellectual property rights or to determine the validity and scope of the proprietary rights of others 
any such litigation could be time consuming and costly 
we could be subject to intellectual property infringement claims as we expand our product and service offerings and the number of competitors increases 
defending against these claims  even if not meritorious  could be expensive and divert our attention from operating our company 
if we become liable to third parties for infringing upon their intellectual property rights  we could be required to pay a substantial damage award and be forced to develop non infringing technology  obtain a license or cease using the applications that contain the infringing technology or content 
we may be unable to develop non infringing technology or content or obtain a license on commercially reasonable terms  or at all 
we also rely on a variety of technologies that are licensed from third parties to perform key functions 
these third party licenses are an essential element of our hosted solutions business 
these third party licenses may not be available to us on commercially reasonable terms in the future 
the loss of or inability to maintain any of these licenses could delay the introduction of software enhancements and other features until equivalent technology can be licensed or developed 
any such delay could materially adversely affect our ability to attract and retain customers 
significant customers as of december   we served approximately customers 
altius health plans  inc  unitedhealth group  inc  the regence group  and qualchoice of arkansas  inc  each represented approximately   and  respectively  of our total revenue for the twelve months ended december employees as of december   we had approximately  employees 
our employees are not subject to any collective bargaining agreements  and we generally have good relations with our employees 

table of contents available information our website is located at www 
trizetto

we make available free of charge through this website all of our sec filings including our annual report on form k  quarterly reports on form q  current reports on form k  and all amendments to those reports  as soon as reasonably practicable after those reports are electronically filed with the sec 
risk factors our business is changing rapidly  which could cause our quarterly operating results to vary and our stock price to fluctuate 
our quarterly operating results have varied in the past  and we expect that they will continue to vary in future periods 
our quarterly operating results can vary significantly based on a number of factors  such as our mix of non recurring and recurring revenue  our ability to add new customers  renew existing accounts  sell additional products and services to existing customers  meet project milestones and customer expectations  and the timing of new customer sales 
the variation in our quarterly operating results could affect the market price of our common stock in a manner that may be unrelated to our long term operating performance 
we expect to increase activities and spending in substantially all of our operational areas 
we base our expense levels in part upon our expectations concerning future revenue  and these expense levels are relatively fixed in the short term 
if we record lower revenue  we may not be able to reduce our short term spending in response 
any shortfall in revenue would have a direct impact on our results of operations 
for these and other reasons  we may not meet the earnings estimates of securities analysts or investors  and our stock price could decline 
our sales cycles are long and unpredictable 
we have experienced long and unpredictable sales cycles  particularly for contracts with large customers  or customers purchasing multiple products and services 
enterprise software typically requires significant capital expenditures by customers  and the decision to outsource it related services is complicated and time consuming 
major purchases by large payer organizations typically range from to months or more from initial contact to contract execution 
there can be no assurance that the prospects currently in our pipeline will sign contracts within a reasonable period of time or at all 
in addition  our implementation cycle has ranged from to months or longer from contract execution to completion of implementation 
during the sales cycle and the implementation cycle  we will expend substantial time  effort and financial resources preparing contract proposals  negotiating the contract and implementing the solution 
we may not realize any revenue to offset these expenditures  and  if we do  accounting principles may not allow us to recognize the revenue during corresponding periods  which could harm our future operating results 
additionally  any decision by our customers to delay implementation may adversely affect our revenues 
we have a history of operating losses and cannot predict when  or if  we will achieve positive net income 
we have generated net losses in of our past quarters through december  
although our revenue has grown in recent periods  we cannot assure you that our revenue will be maintained at the current level or increase in the future 
in addition  we have a limited operating history and it is difficult to evaluate our business 
our stockholders must consider the risks  uncertainties  expenses and difficulties frequently encountered by companies in their early stages of development  particularly companies in rapidly evolving markets 
we cannot assure you that we will achieve or sustain positive earnings on either a quarterly or annual basis 
we currently derive our revenue primarily from providing hosted solutions  software licensing and maintenance  and other services such as consulting 
we depend on the continued demand for healthcare information technology and related services 
we plan to continue investing in administrative infrastructure  research and development  sales and marketing  and acquisitions 
as a result  we may never achieve or sustain positive net income 

table of contents we depend on our software application vendor relationships  and if our software application vendors terminate or modify existing contracts or experience business difficulties  or if we are unable to establish new relationships with additional software application vendors  it could harm our business 
we depend  and will continue to depend  on our licensing and business relationships with third party software application vendors 
our success depends significantly on our ability to maintain our existing relationships with our vendors and to build new relationships with other vendors in order to enhance our services and application offerings and remain competitive 
although most of our licensing agreements are perpetual or automatically renewable  they are subject to termination in the event that we materially breach such agreements 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to maintain relationships with our vendors or establish relationships with new vendors 
we cannot assure you that the software  products or services of our third party vendors will achieve or maintain market acceptance or commercial success 
accordingly  we cannot assure you that our existing relationships will result in sustained business partnerships  successful product or service offerings or the generation of significant revenue for us 
our arrangements with third party software application vendors are not exclusive 
we cannot assure you that these third party vendors regard our relationships with them as important to their own respective businesses and operations 
they may reassess their commitment to us at any time and may choose to develop or enhance their own competing distribution channels and product support services 
if we do not maintain our existing relationships or if the economic terms of our business relationships change  we may not be able to license and offer these services and products on commercially reasonable terms or at all 
our inability to obtain any of these licenses could delay service development or timely introduction of new services and divert our resources 
any such delays could materially adversely affect our business  financial condition and operating results 
our licenses for the use of third party software applications are essential to the technology solutions we provide for our customers 
loss of any one of our major vendor agreements may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
revenue from a limited number of customers comprises a significant portion of our total revenue  and if these customers terminate or modify existing contracts or experience business difficulties  it could adversely affect our earnings 
as of december   we were providing services to approximately customers 
four of our customers  altius health plans  inc  unitedhealth group  inc  the regence group  and qualchoice of arkansas  represented an aggregate of approximately of our total revenue for the twelve months ended december  although we typically enter into multi year customer agreements  a majority of our customers are able to reduce or cancel their use of our services before the end of the contract term  subject to monetary penalties 
we also provide services to some hosted customers without long term contracts 
in addition  many of our contracts are structured so that we generate revenue based on units of volume  which include the number of members  number of physicians or number of users 
if our customers experience business difficulties and the units of volume decline or if a customer ceases operations for any reason  we will generate less revenue under these contracts and our operating results may be materially and adversely impacted 
our operating expenses are relatively fixed and cannot be reduced on short notice to compensate for unanticipated contract cancellations or reductions 
as a result  any termination  significant reduction or modification of our business relationships with any of our significant customers could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
we are growing rapidly  and our inability to manage this growth could harm our business 
we have rapidly and significantly expanded our operations and expect to continue to do so 
this growth has placed  and is expected to continue to place  a significant strain on our managerial  operational  and financial resources and information systems 
as of december   we had grown to approximately  employees  from approximately employees and independent contractors in december if we are unable to manage our growth effectively  it could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our acquisition strategy may disrupt our business and require additional financing 
since inception  we have made several acquisitions and may continue to seek strategic acquisitions as part of our growth strategy 
we compete with other companies to acquire businesses  making it difficult to acquire suitable companies on favorable terms 
we may be unable to successfully integrate companies that we have acquired or may acquire in the future in a timely manner 
if we are unable to successfully integrate acquired businesses  we may incur substantial costs and delays or other operational  technical or financial problems 
in addition  the failure to successfully integrate 
table of contents acquisitions may divert management s attention from our existing business and may damage our relationships with our key customers and employees 
to finance future acquisitions  we may issue equity securities that could be dilutive to our stockholders 
we may also incur debt and additional amortization expenses related to goodwill and other intangible assets as a result of acquisitions 
the interest expense related to this debt and additional amortization expense may significantly reduce our profitability and have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
our need for additional financing is uncertain as is our ability to raise capital if required 
if we continue to incur losses  we may need additional financing to fund operations or growth 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to raise additional funds through public or private financings  at any particular point in the future or on favorable terms 
future financings could adversely affect your ownership interest in comparison with those of other stockholders 
our business will suffer if our software products contain errors 
the proprietary and third party software products we offer are inherently complex 
despite testing and quality control  we cannot be certain that errors will not be found in current versions  new versions or enhancements of our products 
significant technical challenges also arise with our products because our customers purchase and deploy those products across a variety of computer platforms and integrate them with a number of third party software applications and databases 
if new or existing customers have difficulty deploying our products or require significant amounts of customer support  our costs would increase 
moreover  we could face possible claims and higher development costs if our software contains undetected errors or if we fail to meet our customers expectations 
as a result of the foregoing  we could experience loss of or delay in revenue and loss of market share  loss of customers  damage to our reputation  failure to achieve market acceptance  diversion of development resources  increased service and warranty costs  legal actions by customers against us which could  whether or not successful  increase costs and distract our management  and increased insurance costs 
our software products contain components developed and maintained by third party software vendors  and we expect that we may have to incorporate software from third party vendors in our future products 
we may not be able to replace the functions provided by the third party software currently offered with our products if that software becomes obsolete  defective or incompatible with future versions of our products or is not adequately maintained or updated 
any significant interruption in the availability of these third party software products or defects in these products could harm the sale of our products unless and until we can secure or develop an alternative source 
although we believe there are adequate alternate sources for the technology currently licensed to us  such alternate sources may not be available to us in a timely manner  may not provide us with the same functions as currently provided to us or may be more expensive than products we currently use 
we could lose customers and revenue if we fail to meet the performance standards and other obligations in our contracts 
many of our service agreements contain performance standards 
if we fail to meet these standards or breach other material obligations under our agreements  our customers could terminate their agreements with us or require that we refund part or all of the fees charged under those agreements 
the termination of any of our material services agreements and or any associated refunds could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 

table of contents if our ability to expand our network infrastructure is constrained in any way  we could lose customers and damage our operating results 
we must continue to expand and adapt our network and technology infrastructure to accommodate additional users  increased transaction volumes and changing customer requirements 
we may not be able to accurately project the rate or timing of increases  if any  in the use of our hosted solutions or be able to expand and upgrade our systems and infrastructure to accommodate such increases 
we may be unable to expand or adapt our network infrastructure to meet additional demand or our customers changing needs on a timely basis  at a commercially reasonable cost or at all 
our current information systems  procedures and controls may not continue to support our operations while maintaining acceptable overall performance and may hinder our ability to exploit the market for healthcare applications and services 
service lapses could cause our users to switch to the services of our competitors 
performance or security problems with our systems could damage our business 
our customers satisfaction and our business could be harmed if we  or our customers experience any system delays  failures or loss of data 
although we devote substantial resources to meeting these demands  errors may occur 
errors in the processing of customer data may result in loss of data  inaccurate information and delays 
such errors could cause us to lose customers and be liable for damages 
we currently process substantially all of our customers transactions and data at our data centers in colorado and illinois 
although we have safeguards for emergencies and we have contracted backup processing for our customers critical functions  the occurrence of a major catastrophic event or other system failure at any of our facilities could interrupt data processing or result in the loss of stored data 
in addition  we depend on the efficient operation of telecommunication providers that have had periodic operational problems or experienced outages 
a material security breach could damage our reputation or result in liability to us 
we retain confidential customer and patient information in our data centers 
therefore  it is critical that our facilities and infrastructure remain secure and that our facilities and infrastructure are perceived by the marketplace to be secure 
despite the implementation of security measures  our infrastructure may be vulnerable to physical break ins  computer viruses  programming errors  attacks by third parties or similar disruptive problems 
our services agreements generally contain limitations on liability  and we maintain insurance with coverage limits of million for general liability and million for professional liability to protect against claims associated with the use of our products and services 
however  the contractual provisions and insurance coverage may not provide adequate coverage against all possible claims that may be asserted 
in addition  appropriate insurance may be unavailable in the future at commercially reasonable rates 
a successful claim in excess of our insurance coverage could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
even unsuccessful claims could result in litigation or arbitration costs and may divert management s attention from our existing business 
our success depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate management and other key personnel 
our success will depend in large part on the continued services of management and key personnel 
competition for personnel in the healthcare information technology market is intense  and there are a limited number of persons with knowledge of  and experience in  this industry 
we do not have employment agreements with most of our executive officers  so any of these individuals may terminate his or her employment with us at any time 
the loss of services from one or more of our management or key personnel  or the inability to hire additional management or key personnel as needed  could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
although we currently experience relatively low rates of turnover for our management and key personnel  the rate of turnover may increase in the future 
in addition  we expect to further grow our operations  and our needs for additional management and key personnel will increase 
our continued ability to compete effectively in our business depends on our ability to attract  retain and motivate these individuals 
we rely on an adequate supply and performance of computer hardware and related equipment from third parties to provide services to larger customers and any significant interruption in the availability or performance of third party hardware and related equipment could adversely affect our ability to deliver our products to certain customers on a timely basis 
as we offer our hosted solution services and software to a greater number of customers and particularly to larger customers  we may require specialized computer equipment that can be difficult to obtain on short notice 
any delay in obtaining such equipment may prevent us from delivering large systems to our customers on a timely basis 
we 
table of contents also rely on such equipment to meet required performance standards 
if such performance standards are not met  we may be adversely impacted under our service agreements with our customers 
any failure or inability to protect our technology and confidential information could adversely affect our business 
our success depends in part upon proprietary software and other confidential information 
the software and information technology industries have experienced widespread unauthorized reproduction of software products and other proprietary technology 
we do not own any patents 
we rely on a combination of copyright  trademark and trade secret laws  confidentiality procedures and contractual provisions to protect our intellectual property 
however  these protections may not be sufficient  and they do not prevent independent third party development of competitive products or services 
we believe that our proprietary rights do not infringe upon the proprietary rights of third parties 
however  third parties may assert infringement claims against us in the future  and we could be required to enter into a license agreement or royalty arrangement with the party asserting the claim 
we may also be required to indemnify customers for claims made against them 
if our consulting services revenue does not grow substantially  our revenue growth could be adversely impacted 
our consulting services revenue represents a significant component of our total revenue and we anticipate that it will continue to represent a significant percentage of total revenue in the future 
the level of consulting services revenue depends upon the healthcare industry s demand for outsourced information technology services and our ability to deliver products that generate implementation and follow on consulting services revenue 
our ability to increase services revenue will depend in part on our ability to increase the capacity of our consulting group  including our ability to recruit  train and retain a sufficient number of qualified personnel 
if we fail to meet the changing demands of technology  we may not continue to be able to compete successfully with other providers of software applications 
the market for our technology and services is highly competitive and rapidly changing and requires potentially expensive technological advances 
we believe our ability to compete in this market will depend in part upon our ability to maintain and continue to develop partnerships with vendors  enhance our current technology and services  respond effectively to technological changes  introduce new technologies  and meet the increasingly sophisticated needs of our customers 
competitors may develop products or technologies that are better or more attractive than those offered by us or that may render our technology and services obsolete 
many of our current and potential competitors are larger and offer broader services and have significantly greater financial  marketing and other competitive resources than us 
part of our business will suffer if health plan customers do not accept internet solutions 
the success of facets e business functions and individual healthweb modules depend in part on the adoption of internet solutions by health plan customers and their constituents enrollees  employers  physicians and other providers 
adoption requires the acceptance of a new way of conducting business and exchanging information 
we expect internet use to continue to grow in number of users and volume of traffic 
the internet infrastructure may be unable to support the demands placed on it by this continued growth 
our business could suffer substantially if internet solutions are not accepted or not perceived to be effective 
the internet may not prove to be a viable commercial marketplace for a number of reasons  including inadequate development of the necessary infrastructure for communication speed  access and server reliability  
table of contents security and confidentiality concerns  lack of development of complementary products  such as high speed modems and high speed communication lines  implementation of competing technologies  delays in the development or adoption of new standards and protocols required to handle increased levels of internet activity  and government regulation 
the intensifying competition we face from both established entities and new entries in the market may adversely affect our revenue and profitability 
we face intense competition 
many of our competitors and potential competitors have significantly greater financial  technical  product development  marketing and other resources and greater market recognition than we have 
many of our competitors also have  or may develop or acquire  substantial installed customer bases in the healthcare industry 
as a result  our competitors may be able to respond more quickly to new or emerging technologies and changes in customer requirements or to devote greater resources to the development  promotion and sale of their applications or services than we can devote 
our competitors can be categorized as follows information technology and outsourcing companies  such as perot systems corporation  ibm  affiliated computer services  computer sciences corporation  and electronic data systems corporation  healthcare information software vendors  such as quality care solutions  inc  platinum equity  llc owns amisys and denovis  inc  healthcare information technology consulting firms  such as first consulting group  inc  superior consultant holdings corporation and the consulting divisions or former affiliates of the major accounting firms  such as deloitte consulting and accenture  healthcare e commerce and portal companies  such as webmd corporation  navimedix and healthtrio  and enterprise application integration vendors such as vitria  seebeyond  tibco  fuego and m each of these types of companies can be expected to compete with us within the various segments of the healthcare information technology market 
in addition  some of our third party software vendors may compete with us from time to time by offering their software on a licensed or hosted basis 
further  other entities that do not presently compete with us may do so in the future  including major software information systems companies  financial services entities or health plans 
we cannot assure you that we will be able to compete successfully against current and future competitors or that competitive pressures faced by us will not have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
the insolvency of our customers or the inability of our customers to pay for our services could negatively affect our financial condition 
healthcare payers are often required to maintain restricted cash reserves and satisfy strict balance sheet ratios promulgated by state regulatory agencies 
in addition  healthcare payers are subject to risks that physician groups or associations within their organizations become subject to costly litigation or become insolvent  which may adversely affect the financial stability of the payer 
if healthcare payers are unable to pay for our services because of their need to maintain cash reserves or failure to maintain balance sheet ratios or solvency  our ability to collect fees for services rendered would be impaired and our financial condition could be adversely affected 

table of contents consolidation of healthcare payer organizations could decrease the number of our existing and potential customers 
there has been and continues to be acquisition and consolidation activity among healthcare payers 
mergers or consolidations of payer organizations in the future could decrease the number of our existing and potential customers 
the acquisition of a customer could have a negative impact on our financial condition 
a smaller overall market for our products and services could result in lower revenue 
changes in government regulation of the healthcare industry could adversely affect our business 
during the past several years  the healthcare industry has been subject to increasing levels of government regulation of  among other things  reimbursement rates and certain capital expenditures 
in addition  proposals to substantially reform medicare  medicaid  and the healthcare system in general have been or are being considered by congress 
these proposals  if enacted  may further increase government involvement in healthcare  lower reimbursement rates and otherwise adversely affect the healthcare industry which could adversely impact our business 
the impact of regulatory developments in the healthcare industry is complex and difficult to predict  and our business could be adversely affected by existing or new healthcare regulatory requirements or interpretations 
participants in the healthcare industry  such as our payer and provider customers  are subject to extensive and frequently changing laws and regulations  including laws and regulations relating to the confidential treatment and secure transmission of patient medical records and other healthcare information 
legislators at both the state and federal levels have proposed and enacted additional legislation relating to the use and disclosure of medical information  and the federal government is likely to enact new federal laws or regulations in the near future 
pursuant to the health insurance portability and accountability act of hipaa  the department of health and human services dhhs has issued a series of regulations setting forth security  privacy and transactions standards for all health plans  clearinghouses and healthcare providers to follow with respect to individually identifiable health information 
dhhs has issued final regulations mandating the use of standard transactions and code sets  with compliance initially required by october  in december  president bush signed hr into law enabling covered entities under hipaa to delay compliance with the standard transactions and code sets rule by one year until october  to qualify for the extension  covered entities were required to submit a compliance plan to the dhhs by october  the plan must include a budget  schedule  work plan and implementation strategy for achieving compliance 
dhhs has also issued final hipaa privacy regulations  with a scheduled compliance date of april   and final hipaa security regulations 
many of our customers will also be subject to state laws implementing the federal gramm leach bliley act  relating to certain disclosures of nonpublic personal health information and nonpublic personal financial information by insurers and health plans 
our payer and provider customers must comply with hipaa  its regulations and other applicable healthcare laws and regulations 
in addition  we may be deemed to be a covered entity subject to hipaa because we offer our customers products that convert data to a hipaa compliant format 
accordingly  we must comply with certain provisions of hipaa and in order for our products and services to be marketable  they must contain features and functions that allow our customers to comply with hipaa and other healthcare laws and regulations 
we believe our products currently allow our customers to comply with existing laws and regulations 
however  because hipaa and its regulations have yet to be fully interpreted  our products may require modification in the future 
if we fail to offer solutions that permit our customers to comply with applicable laws and regulations  our business will suffer 
we perform billing and claims services that are governed by numerous federal and state civil and criminal laws 
the federal government in recent years has imposed heightened scrutiny on billing and collection practices of healthcare providers and related entities  particularly with respect to potentially fraudulent billing practices  such as submissions of inflated claims for payment and upcoding 
violations of the laws regarding billing and coding may lead to civil monetary penalties  criminal fines  imprisonment or exclusion from participation in medicare  medicaid and other federally funded healthcare programs for our customers and for us 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
federal and state consumer protection laws may apply to us when we bill patients directly for the cost of physician services provided 
failure to comply with any of these laws or regulations could result in a loss of licensure or other fines and penalties 
any of these results could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and operating results 
in addition  laws governing healthcare payers and providers are often not uniform among states 
this could require us to undertake the expense and difficulty of tailoring our products in order for our customers to be in compliance with applicable state and local laws and regulations 

table of contents part of our business is subject to government regulation relating to the internet that could impair our operations 
the internet and its associated technologies are subject to increasing government regulation 
a number of legislative and regulatory proposals are under consideration by federal  state  local and foreign governments and agencies 
laws or regulations may be adopted with respect to the internet relating to liability for information retrieved from or transmitted over the internet  on line content regulation  user privacy  taxation and quality of products and services 
many existing laws and regulations  when enacted  did not anticipate the methods of the internet based hosted  software and information technology solutions we offer 
we believe  however  that these laws may be applied to us 
we expect our products and services to be in substantial compliance with all material federal  state and local laws and regulations governing our operations 
however  new legal requirements or interpretations applicable to the internet could decrease the growth in the use of the internet  limit the use of the internet for our products and services or prohibit the sale of a particular product or service  increase our cost of doing business  or otherwise have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial conditions 
to the extent that we market our products and services outside the united states  the international regulatory environment relating to the internet and healthcare services could also have an adverse effect on our business 
a number of legislative proposals have been made that would impose additional taxes on the sale of goods and services over the internet 
although in october congress placed a three year moratorium on state and local taxes on internet access or on discriminatory taxes on electronic commerce  existing state or local laws were specifically excluded from this moratorium

impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets 
under financial accounting standards board fasb statement no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets statement  goodwill and intangible assets deemed to have indefinite lives are subject to annual impairment tests using a two step process prescribed in statement the first step looks for indicators of impairment 
if indicators of impairment are revealed in the first step  then the second step is conducted to measure the amount of the impairment  if any 
we adopted statement effective as of january  and performed our initial impairment test as of march  our first test did not reveal any indicators of impairment as of march  during the fourth quarter of  we performed another test for impairment  which also did not reveal any indicators of impairment 
after the end of the fourth quarter of  our market capitalization decreased to an amount below our book value prior to any impairment charges 
as a result of this decrease  we concluded that sufficient indicators existed to warrant an analysis of whether any portion of our goodwill was impaired as of the fourth quarter of we engaged an independent valuation firm to perform a review of the value of our goodwill 
based on this independent valuation  which used a discounted cash flow valuation technique  we recognized an impairment charge of million to our goodwill in the fourth quarter of net of a tax effect of million 
additionally  we performed a review of the value of our property  plant and equipment  capitalized research and development costs and other intangible assets in accordance with fasb statement no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets statement no 

based on this review  we recognized an impairment charge of million in the fourth quarter of related to certain intangible assets  as the value of the undiscounted cash flows expected to be generated by these assets over their useful lives did not exceed their carrying value as of december  restructuring and related impairment charges 
in december  we initiated a number of restructuring actions focused on eliminating redundancies  streamlining operations and improving overall financial results

table of contents critical accounting policies and estimates we recognize revenue when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  the product or service has been delivered  fees are fixed and determinable  collectibility is probable and all other significant obligations have been fulfilled 
our revenue is classified into two categories recurring and non recurring 
for the year ended december   approximately of our total revenue was recurring and was non recurring 
we generate recurring revenue from several sources  including the provision of outsourcing services  such as software hosting and other business services  and the sale of maintenance and support for our proprietary software products 
recurring revenue is billed and recognized monthly over the contract term  typically three to seven years 
many of our outsourcing services agreements contain performance standards that require us to maintain a certain level of operating performance 
recurring software maintenance revenue is typically based on one year renewable contracts 
software maintenance and support revenues are recognized ratably over the contract period 
cash for software maintenance received in advance is recorded on the balance sheet as deferred revenue 
we generate non recurring revenue from the licensing of our software 
we follow the provisions of the securities and exchange commission staff accounting bulletin no 
 revenue recognition  aicpa statements of position sop software revenue recognition as amended  and eitf issue  multiple element arrangements 
software license revenue is recognized upon the execution of a license agreement  upon delivery of the software  when fees are fixed and determinable  when collectibility is probable and when all other significant obligations have been fulfilled 
for software license agreements in which customer acceptance is a material condition of earning the license fees  revenue is not recognized until acceptance occurs 
for arrangements containing multiple elements  such as software license fees  consulting services and maintenance  and where vendor specific objective evidence vsoe of fair value exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method 
under the residual method  the arrangement fee is recognized as follows the total fair value of the undelivered elements  as indicated by vendor specific objective evidence  is deferred and subsequently recognized in accordance with the relevant sections of sop and the difference between the total arrangement fee and the amount deferred for the undelivered elements is recognized as revenue related to the delivered elements 
for arrangements in which vsoe does not exist for each element  including specified upgrades  revenue is deferred and not recognized until delivery of the element without vsoe has occurred 
we also generate non recurring revenue from consulting fees for implementation  installation  data conversion  and training related to the use of our proprietary and third party licensed products 
we recognize revenues for these services as they are performed  if contracted for on a time and material basis  or using the percentage of completion method  if contracted for on a fixed fee basis 
we may pay certain up front fees in connection with the establishment of our hosting and outsourcing services contracts 
the costs are capitalized and amortized over the life of the contract  provided that such amounts are recoverable from future revenue under the contract 
if an up front fee is not recoverable from future revenue  or it cannot be offset by contract cancellation penalties paid by the customer  the fee will be written off as an expense in the period it is deemed unrecoverable 
total up front fees outstanding as of december  were million 
in july  we renegotiated one of our contracts with an outsourcing services customer  resulting in a reimbursement to us of million in cash 
we had previously paid million as an up front fee when the contract was signed and had amortized approximately  of the amount at the time it was renegotiated 
in return for the payment of million  we agreed to lower our monthly service fees and to issue a million letter of credit to the state in which the customer operates business  to maintain the customer s regulatory capital requirement 
the letter of credit is secured by million of our cash  which is included in restricted cash 
the face amount of the letter of credit may be reduced over time if the customer s regulatory capital increases to certain prescribed levels and other conditions exist 
we recorded no revenue or expense as a result of this transaction 
cost of revenue includes costs related to the products and services we provide to our customers and costs associated with the operation and maintenance of our customer connectivity centers 
these costs include salaries and related expenses for consulting personnel  customer connectivity centers personnel  customer support personnel  application software license fees  amortization of capitalized software development costs  telecommunications costs and maintenance costs 
research and development r d expenses are salaries and related expenses associated with the development of software applications prior to establishing technological feasibility 
such expenses include compensation paid to engineering personnel and fees to outside contractors and consultants 
costs incurred internally in the development of our software products are expensed as incurred as r d expenses until technological feasibility has been established  at which time any future production costs are properly capitalized and amortized to the cost of revenue based on current and future revenue over the remaining estimated economic life of the product 

table of contents to the extent that amounts capitalized for r d become impaired due to the introduction of new technology  such amounts will be written off 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of salaries and related expenses for sales  sales commissions  account management  marketing  administrative  finance  legal  human resources and executive personnel  and fees for professional services

 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets  we review property  plant and equipment  capitalized research and development costs and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated undiscounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset  plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset if any  are less than the carrying value of the asset 
this approach uses our estimates of future market growth  forecasted revenue and costs and expected periods the assets will be utilized 
when an impairment is identified  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value

 elements of financial statements  is met  and be measured at fair value  consistent with fasb concepts statement no 
 using cash flow information and present value in accounting measurements

 accounting for contingencies 
fin 
table of contents also requires a guarantor to make significant new disclosures for virtually all guarantees even if the likelihood of the guarantor s having to make payments under the guarantee is remote
