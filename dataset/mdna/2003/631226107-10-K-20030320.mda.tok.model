through our efforts we achieved both top and bottom line growth in a challenging economic environment 
while our overall results were positive  our gross margin percentage decreased during due to over capacity in the paper industry and competitive pricing 
our results for included the contributions of our strategic acquisitions of the assets of computer imaging supplies  known as cis  used in the fraud prevention business and certain assets of dietzgen llc dietzgen  used in the wide format business

the reincorporation eliminated certain restrictions on our ability to borrow funds and our new corporate charter increases shareholder rights and reduces our corporate expenses 
in connection with our reincorporation  our authorized capitalization was reduced from million shares of common stock and million shares of preferred stock  each with a par value of per share  to million shares of common stock  par value per share 
as part of the reincorporation  the  shares of common stock held in treasury were retired with their cost above par value allocated on a pro rata basis against additional paid in capital and retained earnings

increased volume in our automatic identification  retail shelf  ticket and inform product lines was partially offset by overall pricing pressures stemming from current economic conditions and overcapacity in the label industry  as well as by volume declines in our supermarket thermal product line 
sales improvements in our automatic identification and inform product lines were driven by growth in the transportation label product used for automatic identification  as well as new business 
sales declines for our supermarket thermal product line were due to pricing pressures  the decision by a customer to produce labels internally and the movement of some existing customers to outsourced centralized meatpacking  partially offset by new lower margin business with other customers 
for  we expect our acquisition of the label company to contribute approximately million to top line growth 
we also anticipate continued pricing pressures due to overcapacity in the label industry 
during the first quarter of  our label products segment lost a major customer to pricing 
sales to this customer will continue through the first quarter of as this customer transitions to a new supplier 
we expect the loss in sales to be offset by new business 
gross margin percentage for our label products segment declined compared to the prior year  primarily due to unabsorbed fixed manufacturing costs in our omaha facility and pricing pressures stemming from current economic conditions and industry overcapacity 
manufacturing costs for the year were negatively impacted by the decreased utilization and unfavorable fixed cost absorption at our omaha  nebraska plant caused by our exit from the lamination business

sales volume for our financial product line improved with the addition of a significant new customer 
sales in our heat seal product line declined primarily due to technology changes

changes in our distribution channel mix were driven in part by an increased focus on value added distributors with lower cost to serve 
we expect this trend to continue 
we also experienced delays in new high speed product launches that prevented us from replacing eroding sales in toners for older machines 
the decline in the segment s gross margin percentage was primarily due to changes in product mix and distribution channel mix  offset partially by savings from outsourcing our filling operation 
our product mix was negatively impacted by a drop in sales for our higher margin xerox compatible developer

the agreement received final approval by the joint committee on taxation of the united states congress as indicated in a letter from the irs appeals office dated december  and is now final 
our agreement determines the tax liability for the period through and results in a net tax refund in the amount of

this assessment represents a total of million of adjustments to taxable income for the years under review 
the proposed adjustments relate to the deductibility of restructuring and other reserves for continuing and discontinued operations and the utilization of foreign net operating losses associated with discontinued operations 
we disagree with the position taken by the irs and filed a formal protest of their proposed adjustments on april  we are working through the irs appeals process to resolve open issues 
we believe that we are adequately reserved for potential liabilities that could arise from the resolution of the irs assessment for the years through while we believe that we have adequately provided for tax liabilities through december   we can provide no assurances that we will prevail in our defense against adjustments proposed in pending or future federal and state examinations 
in addition  we can provide no assurances that the ultimate resolution of open tax matters will not be either in excess of or less than current reserves

in march  the same individual plaintiffs joined by a third plaintiff filed a consolidated amended class action complaint 
the consolidated complaint alleged that  in connection with cerion s initial public offering  the defendants issued materially false and misleading statements and omitted the disclosure of material facts regarding  in particular  certain significant customer relationships 
in october  the circuit court on motion by the defendants  dismissed the consolidated complaint 
the plaintiffs filed a second amended consolidated complaint alleging similar claims as the first consolidated complaint seeking damages and injunctive relief 
on may   the circuit court  on motion by the defendants  dismissed with prejudice the second amended consolidated complaint 
the plaintiffs filed with the appellate court an appeal of the circuit court s ruling 
on november   the appellate court reversed the circuit court s ruling that dismissed the second amended consolidated complaint 
the appellate court ruled that the second amended consolidated complaint represented a valid claim and sent the case back to the circuit court for further proceedings 
on december   we filed a petition with the supreme court of illinois 
in that petition  we asked the supreme court of illinois to determine whether the circuit court or the appellate court is correct 
our petition was denied and the case was sent to the circuit court for trial 
discovery has been completed  but no date has been set for trial and pre trial motions 
non binding mediation discussions were held in november without resolving the dispute 
we believe that the lawsuit is without merit and will continue to defend ourselves in this matter 
we also believe that we will receive the value of our percent ownership in cerion liquidating trust which was valued at 
million on an after tax basis at december  our investment in cerion is included under other assets in our consolidated balance sheet

krasnecki and egk realty corporation filed suit against nashua corporation in the superior court of the commonwealth of massachusetts  middlesex county 
the plaintiffs are the owners of real property  formerly leased by us  located at billerica road  chelmsford  massachusetts 
the plaintiffs allege that when we vacated the premised in  we failed to remove improvements we had made to the property  failed to clean the premises as required by our lease  and left contamination on the property resulting in lost opportunities to the plaintiffs  for which the plaintiffs seek damages 
we responded to their complaint  denying all liability and asserting affirmative defenses 
we maintain that when we vacated the premises  we removed three underground tanks that we were entitled to remove under the terms of our lease  we detected soil contamination  reported and took prompt remedial action all in accordance with massachusetts law  and are not liable to the plaintiffs 
we also deny that we failed to remove improvements or that we failed to clean the premises in accordance with the terms of our lease 
the matter has been scheduled for a jury trial in april we believe that the lawsuit is without merit and will continue to defend ourselves in this matter 
we are involved in certain environmental matters and have been designated by the environmental protection agency  referred to as the epa  as a potentially responsible party for certain hazardous waste sites 
in addition  we have been notified by certain state environmental agencies that some of our sites not addressed by the epa require remedial action 
these sites are in various stages of investigation and remediation 
due to the unique physical characteristics of each site  the technology employed  the extended timeframes of each remediation  the interpretation of applicable laws and regulations and the financial viability of other potential participants  our ultimate cost of remediation is difficult to estimate 
accordingly  estimates could either increase or decrease in the future due to changes in such factors 
at december   based on the facts currently known and our prior experience with these matters  we have concluded that there is at least a reasonable possibility that site assessment  remediation and monitoring costs will be incurred 
we have estimated a range for these costs of 
million to million for continuing operations and approximately 
million for discontinued operations 
these estimates could increase if other potentially responsible parties or our insurance carriers are unable or unwilling to bear their allocated share and cannot be compelled to do so 
at december   our accrual balances relating to environmental matters were 
million for continuing operations and 
million for discontinued operations 
based on information currently available  we believe that it is probable that the major potentially responsible parties will fully pay the costs apportioned to them 
we believe that our remediation expense is not likely to have a material adverse effect on our consolidated financial position or results of operations 
we are involved in various other lawsuits  claims and inquiries  most of which are routine to the nature of our business 
in the opinion of our management  the resolution of these matters will not materially affect our company 
application of critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires that we make estimates and assumptions for the reporting period and as of the financial statement date 
our management has discussed our critical accounting estimates  policies and related disclosures with the audit committee of our board of directors 
these estimates and assumptions affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosure of contingent liabilities and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses 
actual results could differ from those amounts 
critical accounting policies are those that are important to the portrayal of our financial condition and results  and which require us to make difficult  subjective and or complex judgments 
critical accounting 
table of contents policies cover accounting matters that are inherently uncertain because the future resolution of such matters is unknown 
we believe that our critical accounting policies include accounts receivable allowance for doubtful accounts we evaluate the collectibility of our accounts receivable based on a combination of factors 
in circumstances where we become aware of a specific customer s inability to meet its financial obligations to us  such as a bankruptcy filing or a substantial down grading of a customer s credit rating  we record a specific reserve to reduce our net receivable to the amount we reasonably expect to collect 
we also record reserves for bad debts based on the length of time our receivables are past due  the payment history of our individual customers and the current financial condition of our customers based on obtainable data and historical payment and loss trends 
our allowance for doubtful accounts was 
million at december  and million at december  the decrease in our estimate during resulted from the write off of previously reserved accounts receivables 
uncertainties affecting our estimates include future industry and economic trends and the related impact on the financial condition of our customers  as well as the ability of our customers to generate cash flows sufficient to pay us amounts due 
if circumstances change  such as higher than expected defaults or an unexpected material adverse change in a customer s ability to meet its financial obligations to us  our estimates of the recoverability of the receivables due us could be reduced by a material amount 
inventories slow moving and obsolescence we estimate and reserve amounts related to slow moving and obsolete inventories that result from changing market conditions 
we develop our estimates based on the quantity and quality of individual classes of inventory compared to historical and projected sales trends 
inventory at december  has been reduced by a reserve of million  based on our assessment of the probable exposure related to excess and obsolete inventories 
our estimated reserve was million at december  major uncertainties in our estimation process include future industry and economic trends  future needs of our customers  our ability to retain or replace our customer base  and other competitive changes in the marketplace 
significant changes in any of the uncertainties used in estimating the loss exposure could result in a materially different net realizable value for our inventory 
goodwill as of december   we had million of goodwill included in our balance sheet 
effective january   we adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
under fas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets are no longer amortized but are reviewed annually  or more frequently if impairment indicators arise  for impairment 
we have performed the initial and annual impairment tests required by fas and have concluded that no impairment exists as of january  and november  we computed the fair value of our reporting units based on a discounted cash flow model and compared the result to the book value of each unit 
the fair value exceeded book value for each reporting unit as of our valuation dates of january  and november  significant estimates included in our valuation included future business results and the discount rate 
material changes in our estimated future operating results or discount rate could significantly impact our carrying value of goodwill 
pension benefits we account for our defined benefit pension plans in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and statement of financial accounting standards no 
 employers accounting for settlements and curtailments of defined benefit pension plans and for termination benefits  which requires that amounts recognized in financial statements be determined on an actuarial basis 
fas and our policies generally reduce the volatility of our pension income or expense resulting from changes in pension liability discount rates and the market performance of our plan assets 

table of contents the most significant elements in determining our pension income or expense in accordance with fas are the expected return on plan assets and the discount rate 
we assumed an expected long term rate of return on plan assets of percent for the year ended december   down from percent for the year ended december  the assumed long term rate of return on assets is applied to a calculated value of plan assets  which recognizes changes in the fair value of plan assets in a systematic manner over five years 
this produces the expected return on plan assets that is included in the determination of our pension income or expense 
the difference between this expected return and the actual return on plan assets is deferred 
the net deferral of past asset gains or losses affects the calculated value of plan assets and  ultimately  our future pension income or expense 
should our long term return on plan assets either fall below or increase above percent  our future pension expense would either increase or decrease 
each year  we determine the discount rate to be used to discount plan liabilities 
the discount rate reflects the current rate at which our pension liabilities could be effectively settled 
in estimating this rate  we look at rates of return on high quality investments 
for the years ended december  and  we used a discount rate of percent 
this rate was used to determine fiscal year and expense 
for year ended december  disclosure purposes  we used a discount rate of percent 
should the discount rate either fall below or increase above  our future pension expense would either increase or decrease 
our policy is to defer the net effect of changes in actuarial assumptions and experience as allowed by fas as discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements  we froze benefits under our salaried pension plans at december  at december   our consolidated pension liability was million compared to a prepaid pension asset of million at the end of this balance sheet change was principally due to a decline in the fair market values of assets held by company sponsored pension plans  as well as decreases in our expected return on plan assets and discount rate resulting from interest rate trends 
as a result  we recognized an other comprehensive loss of million  net of a million tax benefit for excluding a million loss incurred as a result of freezing our salaried pension plans  we recognized consolidated pretax pension expense of 
million for the year ended december   up from 
million in future changes in our actuarial assumptions and investment results due to future interest rate trends could have a material adverse effect on our future costs and pension obligations 
deferred tax assets as of december   we had approximately million of deferred tax assets 
during  we added deferred tax assets of million associated with a minimum pension liability adjustment as discussed in detail in note to our consolidated financial statements 
a portion of our deferred tax assets relates to state loss carryforwards that expire between and we have established a valuation allowance of 
million for our state loss carryforwards 
the realization of our deferred tax assets is based upon estimates of future taxable income and tax planning strategies 
in preparing estimates of future taxable income  we have used the same assumptions and projections utilized in our internal forecasts 
based on these projections and tax planning strategies  we estimate that our unreserved loss carryforwards and other deferred tax assets will be fully utilized 
significant changes in any of the uncertainties used in estimating our future taxable income could impair our ability to utilize our deferred tax assets 
additional disclosures relating to income taxes and our deferred tax assets are included in note to our consolidated financial statements 
environmental reserves we expense environmental expenditures relating to ongoing operations unless the expenditures extend the life  increase the capacity or improve the safety or efficiency of our property  mitigate or prevent environmental contamination that has yet to occur and improve our property compared with its original condition  or are incurred for property held for sale 
we record specific reserves related to site assessments  remediation or monitoring when the costs are both probable and the amount can be reasonably estimated 
we base estimates on in house and third party studies considering current technologies  remediation alternatives and current environmental standards 
in addition  if there are other participants and the site is joint and several  the financial stability of other participants is considered in determining our accrual 
at december   we 
table of contents believe the probable range for future expenditures related to continuing operations is 
million to million and have accrued 
million 
we believe the probable amount for future expenditures for discontinued operations is 
million and have accrued this amount 
the decline in our accruals from million for continuing operations and 
million for discontinued operations at december  were due to current year payments 
uncertainties affecting our estimates include changes in the type or degree of contamination uncovered during assessment and actual clean up  changes in available treatment technologies  changes in the financial condition of other participants for sites with joint and several responsibility  changes in the financial condition of insurance carriers financially responsible for our share of the remediation costs at certain sites  changes in local  state or federal standards or the application of those standards by governmental officials 
we believe a material change in any of the uncertainties described above could result in spending materially different from the amounts accrued 
item a 
quantitive and qualitative disclosures about market risk we are exposed to market risks from interest rate fluctuations relating to our debt 
we performed a sensitivity analysis assuming a hypothetical percent increase in interest rates for our debt as of december  this analysis indicated that a percent increase in interest rates would not have a material effect on our consolidated financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
actual changes in interest rates and their impact on us could differ materially from this hypothetical analysis
