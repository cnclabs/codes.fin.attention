customers we serve a variety of customers in three major categories advertising and design agencies  publishing and media companies and corporate communications departments 
due to the wide variety of customers and channels to and through which our products and services are marketed  as well as their dispersion across many geographic areas  the company is not dependent upon a single customer or a few customers  the loss of which would have a material adverse effect on the company 
advertising and design agencies for our advertising and design agency customers  we supply images that cover a wide variety of contemporary subjects including lifestyles  business  science  health and beauty  sports  transportation and travel 
these customers usually have a commercial  advertising or editorial message they are trying to convey and  consequently  are typically looking for a specific conceptual image 
image quality and relevance are important factors in the customer s decision 
advertising and design agency customers need to access imagery as part of their everyday working life 
publishing and media companies we supply images to a customer base of professional image users who are involved in the publication of newspapers  books and magazines  both online and in traditional media  as well as the production of commercial motion pictures  television advertisements and programming  documentaries and other editorial media 
the imagery that is provided to these customers ranges from contemporary editorial imagery  to contemporary and archival moving imagery  or film  and still imagery covering major political  social and sporting events since the beginning of photography in the early nineteenth century

all new images accepted into our collections are digitized  assigned keywords and posted on our website and are available for search  selection  license and download hours a day  seven days a week

for customers seeking film footage  we maintain and license a growing library of commercially desirable cinematography covering a broad range of contemporary and archival subject matter 
our film collection represents imagery from hundreds of cinematographers and film producers  and is cataloged on computer for quick access and retrieval in film  tape and digital formats 
for our publishing and media customers  availability of imagery is time critical 
our success in this area is dependent on our ability to source imagery from news  sports and celebrity events as they occur and to make them immediately available to customers

form k part i item in  we expanded the number of images from third party providers available to customers on our website 
we believe that by offering a selection of the highest quality images from other providers of visual content  we enhance our ability to serve our customers and to generate additional sales with minimal incremental cost 
marketing  sales and distribution marketing we reach our customers through diverse marketing campaigns including print ads  direct mail  e mail communications  printed catalogs and our website 
these campaigns aim to build awareness for the getty images brand  promote the latest imagery available on gettyimages 
com and  in many cases  act as sales tools in the selection of image products for license 
we also serve our international markets by producing localized marketing materials where appropriate 
in  we implemented a worldwide communication campaign to promote getty images as the premium brand that creates and distributes many types of imagery to a wide range of customers 
the campaign channels all of our customers to the gettyimages 
com website 
online marketing our website acts as a marketing tool as well as a sales tool  making the images of each collection available for research and selection online 
for example  we often invite customers to view our latest creative photography in special galleries on our website 
we also promote images available on cd rom and regularly provide a summary of the latest breaking stories in the news section of our website where customers can view  license and download available imagery 
printed catalogs and direct marketing catalogs  direct mail and e mail communications are part of our integrated marketing campaigns aimed at gaining new customers and promoting our latest imagery to our existing customer base 
in  we began to shift our marketing strategy from an emphasis on printed catalogs to a focus on e mail marketing and new forms of interactive communications 
we also launched a magazine  called taxi  which is designed to communicate the strength of the new taxi image collection as well as to provide information for customers about visual trends around the world 
in addition  we consolidated several catalogs into one web companion promoting our latest royalty free imagery 
we believe these forms are more cost effective than printed catalogs  provide more opportunities for targeted marketing and better meet our customers needs 
demonstration reels in addition to specific print advertising  e mail and direct marketing  we market our film collections through demonstration reels sent directly to our existing and potential customers 
these demonstration reels contain samples of available footage 
in  we undertook an effort to digitize our core film collection and upload it to our website in order to make the collection more readily available to customers for search and download via the internet 
sales and distribution we license our imagery through our broad international distribution network of company operated offices and distributors in approximately countries 
we believe that control of our outlets results in more focused sales and marketing activities 
a direct sales force and key accounts management team target advertising  publishing and communications companies  as well as other high volume users of images 
our direct sales force focuses on reaching buyers who are generally responsible for significant licenses of imagery 
in order to assist our customers in using the images  our sales force includes technical support staff and training personnel who provide assistance to customers 
these consultants have expertise in digital image applications  design tools and photo manipulation methodologies 
we encourage our customers to take advantage of the comprehensive image search capabilities of our website and digital delivery of selected images 
over the past few years  the percentage of our business that originates on our website and is digitally delivered over the internet to our customers has increased substantially 
in  virtually all still imagery was delivered to customers digitally 
we believe the ability to search for  select  license and download images over the internet offers our customers advantages in terms of convenience  speed and cost efficiency  and enables us to achieve greater economies of scale 
we will continue to focus on digital delivery as the primary method of delivering images to our customers 
direct communication with our customers  however  remains a significant component of our sales strategy 
our sales representatives assist customers in finding the images they need and keep them informed about new products and services offered by the company 
we also support and serve our customers who wish to receive our imagery through traditional analog means  which involves the physical distribution of imagery on duplicate film transparencies and tape 
in many instances  we serve customers through a combination of e commerce and more traditional methods of customer service

form k part i item product rights we maintain control of our products at all times 
customers may license the rights  on an exclusive or non exclusive basis  to use single images  film clips or cd rom products containing multiple images 
customers may also license rights to our editorial images on a subscription basis 
ownership of the images never passes to the customer 
licensing methods there are three primary types of imagery in our collections and three corresponding licensing methods rights managed  including still and moving contemporary and archival imagery  royalty free  including still and moving imagery  and annual subscription  encompassing editorial imagery only 
for rights managed licensing  the price of the license is based on how the image will be used 
the criteria used in establishing the price include geographical distribution  image size  license duration and circulation 
for example  an image to be used as an eighth of a page photo in a brochure to be distributed in one city for three months will cost less to license than an image to be used in a global advertising campaign for a year that includes print advertising  billboards and point of purchase displays 
for an additional fee  customers may also license exclusive rights to an image in a particular geography or industry for a prescribed period of time 
for royalty free licensing  the price of the license is based on the size of the digital file  from standard resolution generally one megabyte to high resolution generally megabytes 
once the customer has licensed the image  that customer may use the image for any purpose without paying additional fees 
royalty free images may be licensed on a single image basis or as part of a collection of images on a cd rom 
subscription licensing is available only for editorial images 
under this licensing method  editorial customers pay an annual fee based on the number of images they expect to use over the next year 
they may then download as many images as they need during the subscription period 
operations and technology in  we completed the first major steps in the implementation of an enterprise wide initiative to integrate the company s web offerings and business processes within one website utilizing one set of back office support systems 
our objective was two fold 
first  we wanted to enable customers to search  select  license and download all of getty images digital content including photographs  film clips and illustrations and services to manage  present  commission and license imagery from one location  gettyimages 
com 
second  we wanted to consolidate sales order processing  customer database management  finance and accounting under one central set of back office systems to support our website 
these new systems span multiple operational activities  including customer interaction  transaction processing  order fulfillment and invoicing 
in  we continued the implementation with the launch of localized language websites that enable customers to search for and license imagery and related materials in united states us english  us english  french  german and spanish and complete transactions in us dollars  euros and british pounds 
in addition  we migrated the remainder of our stock photography and editorial collections to gettyimages 
com 
the technology architecture supporting gettyimages 
com employs a set of software applications to categorize digital content and embed appropriate keywords and search data metadata  search large information databases across languages and linguistic context  present detailed information related to specific digital content elements  manage online e commerce transactions for the license of digital content  manage invoice generation and accounts receivable from customers  and track a broad range of intellectual property rights and permissions 
these services and systems use a combination of our proprietary technologies and commercially available licensed technologies 
we focus our internal development efforts on creating and enhancing the specialized proprietary software that is unique to our business 
we intend to continue to investigate  qualify and develop technology and internal systems that support key areas of our business to enhance the online and offline experience for our customers 
in particular  we have implemented and continue to develop a flexible infrastructure that will facilitate the sale and distribution of third party digital content through our online e commerce systems 
certain of our image search  image selection  rights management  customer interaction  order collection  fulfillment and back office systems are proprietary 
our online platform architecture is primarily based on microsoft technologies 
these systems were designed to provide reliable e commerce connectivity and responsive online customer interaction 
our systems infrastructure is hosted internally at multiple locations and externally at cable wireless internet services 
both internal and external hosting centers provide hour monitoring  power generators and limited back up systems 
competition the market for visual content and related products and services is highly competitive

form k part i item quality of contributing photographers and cinematographers under contract with a company  effective use of developing technology  customer service  pricing  accessibility of imagery  distribution capability and speed of fulfillment 
our current or potential competitors include other general visual content providers such as comstock  corbis corporation  photonica  superstock and zefa visual media  specialized visual content companies that are well established in their local  content or product specific markets such as reuters news service  the associated press  agence france presse  action images plc  wireimage and zuma press  stock film footage businesses such as corbis motion  and commissioned photographers 
there are also hundreds of small stock photography and film footage agencies and image content aggregators throughout the world 
please see factors that may affect the business below for more information about the competitive conditions in the visual content industry 
intellectual property most of the images licensed by us are obtained from independent photographers and cinematographers on an exclusive basis 
professional photographers and cinematographers prefer to retain ownership of their work 
as a result  copyright to an image remains with the contributing photographer or cinematographer in most cases  while we obtain the exclusive right to market the image on their behalf for a period of time 
a substantial portion of the editorial images  hulton archive images and certain images in our other collections are owned by us or are in the public domain 
we also own numerous trademarks that are important to our business 
depending upon the jurisdiction  trademarks are valid as long as they are in use and or their registrations are properly maintained and they have not been found to have become generic 
registrations of trademarks generally can be renewed indefinitely as long as the trademarks are in use 
please see factors that may affect the business our right to use the getty images trademarks is subject to forfeiture in the event we experience a change of control below for more information about certain of our trademarks 
factors that may affect the business we may not be able to compete effectively against existing or potential competitors the visual content industry is highly competitive 
we compete directly with a number of large and small visual content companies  news wire services  and commissioned photographers to provide imagery to businesses 
we believe that the principal competitive factors in the visual content industry are name recognition  company reputation  the quality  relevance and diversity of the images in a company s collections  effective use of developing technology  customer service  pricing  accessibility of imagery  distribution capability and speed of fulfillment 
some of our existing and potential competitors may have or may develop resources superior to ours  or other such competitive advantages 
our future performance also depends on our ability to provide timely and unique editorial content  and to review and refresh our creative collections in order to provide our customers with the most relevant content 
if we fail to add relevant new imagery in a timely manner  customers requiring such content may use other visual content providers to obtain imagery 
our quarterly financial results and stock price may fluctuate our revenues and operating results are expected to vary from quarter to quarter due to a number of factors  both within and outside of our control  including  but not limited to the following demand for our existing and new products and services  and those of our competitors  changes in our pricing policies  changes in the sales mix of our products and services  including the mix of licenses of analog and digital imagery  company owned and licensed imagery  and the geographic distribution of such licenses  our ability to attract customers to our websites and the frequency of repeat licensing by our customers  shifts in the nature and amount of publicity about us  our competitors or the visual content industry  the effect of fluctuations in foreign exchange rates on the results of our operations outside the us  costs related to potential acquisitions and development of technology  services  or businesses  and changes in us and global capital markets and economies  or in applicable tax laws and regulations

form k part i item because of these risks and others  it is possible that some future quarterly results may be below or above the expectations of analysts and investors and our stock price may fluctuate 
third party image providers are important to our business we have entered into commercial agreements with other businesses to host and license their imagery on the gettyimages 
com website 
these arrangements require resource and personnel commitments by getty images  limiting the number of third party images we may host or integrate during a given period 
additionally  if there are problems with the relevancy  technical quality  or market and customer acceptance of this third party imagery  our revenues and operating results may be adversely affected 
impairment of the value of significant assets could have an adverse impact on our operating results our operating results and earnings in future periods may be adversely affected as a result of impairments to the reported value of certain significant assets  the valuation of which requires management s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill is the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill arising from business combinations prior to july  was amortized over the associated estimated useful lives  ranging from three to years 
amortization of goodwill was million and million for and  respectively 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible assets 
this statement required us to cease amortization of goodwill and alternatively test the net goodwill balance for impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
when assessing impairment  the company must estimate the implied fair value of its goodwill 
this fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model that involves significant assumptions and estimates based on management s best judgments of current and future circumstances  including currently enacted tax laws  future risk free rates of return  and the company s future financial performance 
as circumstances change  it is reasonably possible that future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings 
any impairment would be recognized as a loss on impairment of assets  which would be included in the calculation of income from operations 
the net balance of goodwill at december  was million 
identifiable intangible assets are assets that do not have physical representation  but that arise from contractual or other legal rights or are capable of being separated or divided from the company and sold  transferred  licensed  rented or exchanged 
for the company  these assets consist mostly of customer lists  covenants not to compete and trademarks  tradenames and copyrights 
identifiable intangible assets are generally valued based on discounted estimated future cash flows  which are inherently uncertain and therefore require management s most difficult judgments 
should future cash flows associated with these assets not meet management s current expectations  it is reasonably possible that the company would be required to accelerate the amortization  or write off the impaired portion  of the unamortized balance of such assets 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives two to years  which are determined in most cases based on contractual or other legal terms 
the net balance of identifiable intangible assets at december  was million 
certain long lived assets the useful lives of certain of the company s long lived assets  including capitalized image content costs and hardware and software included within property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets  are based on the estimated period over which the assets are expected to provide benefit to the company 
should we determine at some point in the future that the useful lives of these assets are shorter than previously determined  the company would be required to accelerate the depreciation  or possibly write off the impaired portion  of the undepreciated balance of such assets 
the estimated useful lives of image content  ranging from generally four years for contemporary content to years for archival content  are determined based on sales history 
historical sales may not be indicative of future sales  and therefore  these estimated lives are inherently uncertain and require management s most difficult judgments 
the balance of capitalized image content costs  net of accumulated depreciation  was million at december  the three year estimated useful life of hardware and software is determined based on prior experience with related technology and the expected future utility of the assets to the company 
as hardware and software providers future support of today s technology and the future of technology in general are inherently uncertain  these estimated lives require management s most difficult judgments 
the balance of hardware and software  net of accumulated depreciation  was million at december  deferred income taxes deferred income taxes  reflecting the impact of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and of tax loss carryforwards  are based on currently enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part i item based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified into net current and net non current amounts  based on the balance sheet classification of the related asset or liability 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million  net of a valuation allowance of million that was established in at million and increased by million in approximately million of the increase was associated with the exercise of employee stock options in the us  and million was related to a capital loss that will likely not be recognized for tax purposes 
while we generated taxable income from our primary us operations in  we had not consistently done so in prior years 
it will be necessary to generate taxable income from our primary us operations of approximately million in order to utilize enough of the domestic tax loss carryforwards to realize the associated deferred tax asset 
furthermore  there may be significant limitations on the ability of the company to realize the tax benefits attributable to these domestic tax loss carryforwards in the event of a change in ownership 
during  we implemented cost reduction programs designed to improve both us and foreign levels of current and prospective taxable income and also implemented tax planning strategies that increased us taxable income 
management believes it is currently reasonable to estimate the impact of these actions on the results of near term future periods and has computed the net deferred tax asset at december  accordingly 
although realization is not assured  management believes  based on its current estimates of near term future taxable income for the company s us operations and tax planning strategies  that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized within a reasonable period of time and substantially prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards between and in the event that actual results differ from management s current expectations  the valuation allowance could materially change  directly impacting our consolidated financial statements 
management will reevaluate the valuation allowance at least annually  most likely early in the fourth quarter 
this timing is appropriate  as it will coincide with completion of our tax filings for the prior year  updating of estimated results of operations for the current year  and preparation of the budget for the following year 
if such evaluation indicates that we are able to utilize more of the deferred tax asset than the net balance  all or a portion of the valuation allowance will be credited to income tax expense or additional paid in capital in the period that such a determination is made 
if the evaluation indicates that we are unable to utilize all or a portion of the net deferred tax asset balance  a greater valuation allowance will be recorded and charged to income tax expense in the period of that determination  which could be in advance of the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
allowance for doubtful accounts the accounting policies and methodology used to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts are based on historical losses as a percentage of sales  existing economic conditions  and specific account analysis of at risk customers and distributors 
historical losses and existing economic conditions may not necessarily be indicative of future losses  and the impact of economic conditions on each of our customers is difficult to estimate  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management s most difficult judgments 
should future uncollectible amounts not reflect management s current estimates  it is reasonably possible that we would be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts or write off specific uncollectible balances through bad debt expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations 
the recorded investment in trade receivables  net of allowances for doubtful accounts  past due days or more as of december  and was million and million  respectively

while we have made improvements in this area  we cannot guarantee that we can prevent these interruptions in the future 
additionally  we have certain dependencies on third party software and system providers for the processing and distribution of our imagery and related products 
system failures or interruptions  whether as a result of our internally developed systems or those of the third party providers  will inconvenience our users  may result in negative publicity and may reduce the volume of images we license online and the attractiveness of our online products and services to our customers

general overview the company is a leading provider of high quality  relevant imagery and related services to creative professionals at advertising agencies  graphic design firms  corporations  and film and broadcasting companies  press and editorial customers involved in newspaper  magazine  book  cd rom and online publishing  and corporate communications departments and other business customers 
revenue we generate our revenue from licensing rights to use imagery and from providing related services 
revenue is principally derived from a large number of relatively small transactions involving licensing rights to use single still images  film clips or pre packaged cd rom 
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item products containing between and images 
we also generate revenue from subscription or bulk purchase agreements under which customers are provided access to imagery online 
still imagery the majority of the still imagery that the company licenses can be broken down into three portfolios rights managed  royalty free  and editorial 
rights managed images are licensed by customers on a use by use basis and generally have higher license fees based on the intended use of the image  including type of media  geographical distribution  image size  license duration  circulation and level of rights protection 
approximately of the company s sales for were for rights managed imagery  with an average license fee for a single rights managed image of approximately  and an average gross margin of approximately 
royalty free images are licensed by customers on a nonexclusive basis and can be used for multiple projects over an unlimited time period 
license fees for pre packaged royalty free cd rom products are generally the same for each licensee  while license fees for single royalty free images differ depending on the file size of the selected image 
approximately of the company s sales for were for royalty free imagery  with an average license fee for a single royalty free image of approximately  and an average gross margin of approximately 
editorial imagery is generally not for resale  trade  packaging  promotion or advertising and is licensed on a single image or subscription basis 
approximately of the company s sales for were for editorial imagery 
because many of these images are licensed on a subscription basis  average license fee is not meaningful 
average gross margin for all editorial images licensed in was approximately 
moving imagery the company also licenses moving imagery  or film  which may be rights managed or royalty free  with license fees based on the intended use of the imagery  including market  geographic area and duration of use 
approximately of the company s sales for were for film  with an average price for a rights managed film clip in north america of approximately  and an average gross margin for all film licensed of approximately 
cost of sales our cost of sales primarily consists of commission payments to contributing photographers  cinematographers and third party image providers collectively referred to as contributors 
these contributors are under contract with the company and typically receive payments of up to of the sales value  depending on the portfolio as discussed above  how the imagery is delivered delivery via digital download results in a lower commission  and where the imagery is licensed licenses outside a contributor s home territory result in lower commissions 
we own a significant number of the images in our collections  and these images do not require commission payments 
aside from direct licensing to customers  the company licenses imagery through distributors worldwide 
licenses through distributors comprised approximately of the company s sales in distributors typically earn and retain of the license fee  and we recognize the remaining as revenue 
commissions paid to contributors on distributor sales are generally of the company s share of the license fee generally of the total license fee 
this results in an average gross margin of approximately on distributor sales 
critical accounting policies and estimates and assumptions the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america us requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements and the revenues and expenses reported during the period 
following are accounting policies that management believes are both most important to the portrayal of the company s financial condition and results of operations and that require management s most difficult judgments as a result of the need to make estimates and assumptions about the effects of matters that are inherently uncertain 
goodwill and identifiable intangible assets goodwill is the excess of the purchase price and related costs over the fair value of net assets acquired in business combinations 
goodwill arising from business combinations prior to july  was amortized over the associated estimated useful lives  ranging from three to years 
amortization of goodwill was million and million for and  respectively 
effective january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 goodwill and other intangible 
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item assets 
this statement required us to cease amortization of goodwill and alternatively test the net goodwill balance for impairment annually and between annual tests in certain circumstances 
when assessing impairment  the company must estimate the implied fair value of its goodwill 
this fair value is based on a discounted cash flow model that involves significant assumptions and estimates based on management s best judgments of current and future circumstances  including currently enacted tax laws  future risk free rates of return  and the company s future financial performance 
as circumstances change  it is reasonably possible that future goodwill impairment tests could result in a charge to earnings 
any impairment would be recognized as a loss on impairment of assets  which would be included in the determination of income from operations 
the net balance of goodwill at december  was million 
identifiable intangible assets are assets that do not have physical representation  but that arise from contractual or other legal rights or are capable of being separated or divided from the company and sold  transferred  licensed  rented  or exchanged 
for the company  these assets consist mostly of customer lists  covenants not to compete and trademarks  tradenames and copyrights 
identifiable intangible assets are generally valued based on discounted estimated future cash flows  which are inherently uncertain and therefore require management s most difficult judgments 
should future cash flows associated with these assets not meet management s current expectations  it is reasonably possible that the company would be required to accelerate the amortization  or write off the impaired portion  of the unamortized balance of such assets 
identifiable intangible assets are amortized on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives two to years  which are determined in most cases based on contractual or other legal terms 
the net balance of identifiable intangible assets at december  was million 
certain long lived assets the useful lives of certain of the company s long lived assets  including capitalized image content costs and hardware and software included within property and equipment in the consolidated balance sheets  are based on the estimated period over which the assets are expected to provide benefit to the company 
should we determine at some point in the future that the useful lives of these assets are shorter than previously determined  the company would be required to accelerate the depreciation  or possibly write off the impaired portion  of the undepreciated balance of such assets 
the estimated useful lives of image content  ranging from generally four years for contemporary content to years for archival content  are determined based on sales history 
historical sales may not be indicative of future sales  and therefore  these estimated lives are inherently uncertain and require management s most difficult judgments 
the balance of capitalized image content costs  net of accumulated depreciation  was million at december  the three year estimated useful life of hardware and software is determined based on prior experience with related technology and the expected future utility of the assets to the company 
as hardware and software providers future support of today s technology and the future of technology in general are inherently uncertain  these estimated lives require management s most difficult judgments 
the balance of hardware and software  net of accumulated depreciation  was million at december  deferred income taxes deferred income taxes  reflecting the impact of temporary differences between financial and tax reporting and of tax loss carryforwards  are based on currently enacted tax laws 
deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance if  based on the weight of available evidence  it is more likely than not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realized 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are classified into net current and net non current amounts  based on the balance sheet classification of the related asset or liability 
as of december   we had net deferred tax assets of million  net of a valuation allowance of million that was established in at million and increased by million in approximately million of the increase was associated with the exercise of employee stock options in the us  and million was related to a capital loss that will likely not be recognized for tax purposes 
while we generated taxable income from our primary us operations in  we had not consistently done so in prior years 
it will be necessary to generate taxable income from our primary us operations of approximately million in order to utilize enough of the domestic tax loss carryforwards to realize the associated deferred tax asset 
furthermore  there may be significant limitations on the ability of the company to realize the tax benefits attributable to these domestic tax loss carryforwards in the event of a change in ownership 
during  we implemented cost reduction programs designed to improve both us and foreign levels of current and prospective taxable income and also implemented tax planning strategies that increased us taxable income 
management believes it is currently 
table of contents getty images  inc 
form k part ii item reasonable to estimate the impact of these actions on the results of near term future periods and has computed the net deferred tax asset at december  accordingly 
although realization is not assured  management believes  based on its current estimates of near term future taxable income for the company s us operations and tax planning strategies  that it is more likely than not that the net deferred tax assets will be realized within a reasonable period of time and substantially prior to the expiration of the net operating loss carryforwards between and in the event that actual results differ from management s current expectations  the valuation allowance could materially change  directly impacting our consolidated financial statements 
management will reevaluate the valuation allowance at least annually  most likely early in the fourth quarter 
this timing is appropriate  as it will coincide with completion of our tax filings for the prior year  updating of estimated results of operations for the current year  and preparation of the budget for the following year 
if such evaluation indicates that we are able to utilize more of the deferred tax asset than the net balance  all or a portion of the valuation allowance will be credited to income tax expense or additional paid in capital in the period that such a determination is made 
if the evaluation indicates that we are unable to utilize all or a portion of the net deferred tax asset balance  a greater valuation allowance will be recorded and charged to income tax expense in the period of that determination  which could be in advance of the expiration of the loss carryforwards 
the deferred tax assets in respect of loss carryforwards and the related loss carryforwards at december  expire as follows deferred taxes net operating loss carryforwards in thousands between and primarily domestic between and foreign indefinite foreign totals foreign exchange foreign exchange gains and losses that arise from the revaluation of foreign currency denominated balances  other than long term intercompany balances  are included in the consolidated statements of operations for the period in which the exchange rates change 
foreign exchange gains and losses that arise from the revaluation of intercompany balances that are of a long term investment nature  for which settlement is not planned or anticipated in the foreseeable future  are reported and accumulated in other comprehensive income loss in the consolidated balance sheets 
should the company reclassify and settle a portion of these intercompany balances at some point due to domestic cash needs or other purposes  these intercompany balances would be redesignated as short term  and all future revaluation gains and losses would be taken through the consolidated statements of operations 
in addition  should the company sell one of the subsidiaries with which it has a long term intercompany balance  the accumulated other comprehensive income or loss associated with that entity would be included in the calculation of the gain or loss on the sale of the subsidiary 
see part ii  item a quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk for disclosure of significant long term intercompany balances 
foreign exchange gains of million and losses of million and million for the years ended december   and  respectively  arose from the revaluation of intercompany balances deemed to be long term in nature and were thus excluded from the consolidated statements of operations and included in the consolidated balance sheets as a component of other comprehensive income loss 
allowance for doubtful accounts the accounting policies and methodology used to estimate our allowance for doubtful accounts are based on historical losses as a percentage of sales  existing economic conditions  and specific account analysis of at risk customers and distributors 
historical losses and existing economic conditions may not necessarily be indicative of future losses  and the impact of economic conditions on each of our customers is difficult to estimate  therefore  the allowance for doubtful accounts requires management s most difficult judgments 
should future uncollectible amounts not reflect management s current estimates  it is reasonably possible that we would be required to increase the allowance for doubtful accounts or write off specific uncollectible balances through bad debt expense included in selling  general and administrative expenses in the consolidated statements of operations

catalogs as described in part iv  item a  note to the consolidated financial statements summary of significant accounting policies  effective october   the costs of producing image marketing catalogs are expensed upon initial distribution of each catalog rather than deferred and amortized

management believes these pro forma figures are useful as the company acquired and disposed of multiple companies during the periods shown  and the pro forma figures allow changes in the results of operations of the company to be presented on a comparable basis 
these pro forma results should not be considered alternatives to the reported results  but should be considered supplemental information

recent accounting pronouncements effective january   the company will adopt sfas no 
 accounting for asset retirement obligations 
this statement requires that the fair value of a liability for an asset retirement obligation  such as an obligation to return leased property to its original state  be recognized in the period in which the obligation is incurred if a reasonable estimate of the fair value of the obligation can be made 
the fair value of the obligation is capitalized as part of the carrying amount of the long lived asset and as an asset retirement obligation liability 
the long lived asset is depreciated over its estimated useful life  and the retirement obligation liability increases over the term of the obligation until it comes due with a corresponding charge to accretion expense 
accretion expense is classified as an operating expense in the consolidated statements of operations and represents the effect of the passage of time on the amount of a liability 
management does not expect the adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements 
effective january   the company adopted sfas no 
 accounting for the impairment or disposal of long lived assets 
this statement requires one model for accounting for long lived assets to be disposed of and broadens the presentation of discontinued operations to include more transactions 
adoption of this statement did not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements  however  it could cause any future long lived asset impairments or disposals to be accounted for or presented in a different manner than in the past 
effective january   the company will adopt sfas no 
 rescission of fasb statements no 
  and  amendment of fasb statement no 
 and technical corrections 
this statement prohibits the classification of gains and losses from extinguishments of debt as extraordinary items unless the extinguishments are unusual in nature and infrequently occurring 
management expects that initial adoption of this statement will not have an impact on the company s consolidated financial statements but could in the future if the company were to extinguish all or a portion of its convertible subordinated debt  or any future debt  prior to maturity 
a gain or loss on the future extinguishment of debt is not likely to be unusual or infrequent and would therefore not be recorded as an extraordinary item as in the past but as a non operating gain or loss in the consolidated statements of operations 
effective january   the company will adopt sfas no 
 accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
this statement requires that liabilities associated with exit or disposal activities be recognized when the liabilities are incurred and can be measured  as opposed to the date that management commits to the activities  thereby delaying the recognition of some liabilities 
in addition  under this standard  employee liabilities are to be recorded at the present value of expected future cash outflows  and operating lease liabilities are to be recorded net of reasonable sublease income  even if it is not management s intent to sublease the property 
changes in the liabilities due to the passage of time are to be recognized as increases in the carrying amounts of the liabilities and as accretion expense 
as management s current plans do not include exit or disposal activities  management does not expect adoption of this statement to have a material impact on the company s consolidated financial statements

the company s forward exchange contracts generally range from one to three months in original maturity and do not cross over quarter ends 
the company does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes 
in general  the company s derivative activities do not create foreign currency exchange rate risk because fluctuations in the value of the instruments used for hedging purposes are offset by fluctuations in the value of the underlying exposures being hedged 
counterparties to derivative financial instruments expose the company to credit related losses in the event of non performance 
however  the company has entered into these instruments with creditworthy financial institutions and considers the risk of non performance to be unlikely

form k part ii item a gains and losses on foreign exchange contracts that are identified as and are effective as hedges of existing assets and liabilities are included in the consolidated statements of operations for the period in which the exchange rates change 
if an underlying hedged transaction were terminated earlier than initially anticipated  the offsetting gain or loss on the related forward foreign exchange contract would be recognized in consolidated statements of operations in the same period 
there were no outstanding foreign exchange contracts or related deferred gains or losses as of december
