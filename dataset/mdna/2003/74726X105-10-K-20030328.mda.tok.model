table of contents professional services 
total revenue for totaled million  down from levels 
our trading community management revenues declined in due to continued competitive pricing pressures  offset to some degree by increases in volume 
this intense pricing pressure is continuing 
software applications revenues also declined  despite growth in revenues from our qrs catalogue product  due to declines in revenues from our enterprise software applications and certain discontinued hosted software products 
the increase in our global services revenues was due to continued growth in our qrs retail intelligence services sm product line offset by declines in qrs professional services and software maintenance revenues  both of which were negatively impacted by the decline in enterprise software revenues 
total revenue for was million  up from the million we reported in  reflecting growth in qrs catalogue and qrs retail intelligence services sm as well as the sale of several enterprise software application licenses 
the growth in these products was offset to a significant degree by declines in our trading community management revenues due to competitive pricing pressure 
our revenues are derived primarily from the north american general merchandise and apparel segment 
general merchandise and apparel represented  and of total revenues in  and  respectively 
the remainder of our revenues was primarily derived from grocery and consumer packaged goods customers 
greater than of our revenues were generated from north american customers for all three years 
gross margins for the full year were  up from the reported in this improvement in our gross margin was due to the impact of million in impairment losses included in cost of revenues in  cost savings from our amended network services agreement with ibm  reduced headcount and facilities expenses  and an overall enhanced focus on cost controls 
gross margins for were the same as levels at 
on a quarterly basis  our total revenues declined each quarter during we expect this trend to continue during the first quarter of primarily due to ongoing competitive pricing pressures within our trading community management solutions group 
we also expect our first quarter gross margins to decline somewhat from the we reported in the fourth quarter of in  we expect to maintain gross margins as a percentage of revenues in the mid to upper forties 
software applications the software applications solutions group includes the qrs catalogue  a hosted application  enterprise software applications  including qrs sourcing and qrs merchandising  and other hosted software applications  including qrs showroom as well as tradeweave logistics and tradeweave sales and inventory analysis 
we discontinued selling tradeweave logistics and tradeweave sales and inventory analysis as stand alone products in mid going forward  any revenues from our recently introduced qrs insight product  acquired through a non exclusive reseller license agreement in january  will be included in enterprise software applications

revenues for the software applications solutions group were down million  or  in as compared to this decline was due to the lack of new enterprise software applications license sales during resulting in a million decline in revenue and the discontinuation of several products which were included in other hosted software applications resulting in an additional decline of million 
these decreases were partially offset by the increase in qrs catalogue revenues of million 
between and  software applications revenue increased  driven primarily by growth in qrs catalogue 
gross margins for the software applications solutions group improved by percentage points from to  due to the discontinuation in of several unprofitable products 
gross margins improved percentage points from to due primarily to an improvement in qrs catalogue gross margins  as discussed further below 
cost of revenues for software applications include million of severance in there was minimal severance included in cost of revenues for software applications in and as indicated in the table above  our qrs catalogue product represented of the revenues in the software applications solutions group in qrs catalogue revenues consist of fees charged for the transmission of uniform product code upc records to from vendors and retailers and of monthly fees for trading partnerships established between vendors and retailers 
qrs catalogue revenues increased from to and from to the increase is primarily attributable to increased usage by our core customer base as well as a revised pricing structure that took effect in july the increase is primarily attributable to an increase in the number of trading partnerships  offset by the consolidation of certain retail divisions of a large customer  may company  which resulted in lower usage of the qrs catalogue 
this 
table of contents consolidation has reduced the number of may company related trading partnerships which  under the current pricing structure  reduced current and expected future qrs catalogue revenues associated with this customer 
we expect that retailers will continue to reorganize their operations in attempts to improve operating efficiencies 
to the extent that such reorganizations reduce the number of their retail operations  the number of our trading partnerships could also be reduced  which  under our present pricing structure  would reduce revenues in future periods 
to date  essentially all qrs catalogue revenues have been derived from north american general merchandise and apparel customers  and we expect this to continue in recently  we expanded our european sales focus beyond qrs sourcing to include qrs catalogue 
we are currently implementing a qrs catalogue trading community enablement program with selfridges  plc  one of the top department store groups in europe 
cost of revenues for qrs catalogue consists primarily of customer and technical support personnel  allocated costs of our data center and purchased network services to transmit catalogue data to and from our data center 
cost of revenues for qrs catalogue increased by from the year ended to the year ended the increase was due to an increase in data center costs allocated to the qrs catalogue concurrent with the phase out of certain other hosted applications in mid  and the costs associated with the opening of a customer support center in europe  partially offset by reductions in headcount costs for our us based customer support team 
in spite of this increase in cost of revenues  qrs catalogue gross margins for the year ended improved by percentage point from the year ended due to an increase in revenues 
in  we experienced a decrease in our qrs catalogue cost of revenues of million  or  which together with an increase in revenues resulted in a significant increase in gross margin 
this cost decline is attributable to the decrease in the cost of purchased network services as a result of a contract which took effect january  effective use of alternative technologies to transmit data to and from the network  and cost savings from customer and technical support headcount reductions during the first quarter of enterprise software applications revenues decreased by during we attribute the significant reduction in enterprise software applications revenues to an economic environment in which companies are hesitant to make large it purchases and the high average sales price of the full qrs sourcing product 
software sales during were incremental sales to existing customers  we sold no new licenses to new customers 
in  we sold several new licenses as well as upgrades 
our qrs sourcing software application is designed to enable customers to improve their sourcing and supply capabilities  financial order management  international logistics and customs management  and merchandising efforts 
enterprise software applications revenues increased in by due to licensed software sales to new and existing customers 
we intend to continue to invest in qrs sourcing to meet customer needs and have several upgrades to the product scheduled for the rest of and early in january of  we introduced qrs insight  another enterprise software application  which allows companies to monitor  escalate and resolve supply chain problems in real time 
cost of revenues for enterprise software applications increased from million in to million in cost of revenues for consists of million of amortization costs related to the ibm crossworlds licenses purchased during the first quarter of we entered into a licensing agreement with ibm crossworlds for the license of their enterprise applications integration tools to enable qrs retail industry customers to accelerate the implementation of qrs solutions 
we amortize the license fees to cost of revenues at the greater of the pro rata of licenses sold or straight lined over the two year estimated life of the licenses see note to the consolidated financial statements 
while we did not sell any licenses of ibm crossworlds software in  we are actively marketing enterprise software applications that include ibm crossworlds licenses and believe the assets associated with enterprise software applications are recoverable 
we continue to monitor these assets for potential impairment 
cost of revenues for enterprise software applications for includes personnel and related costs for custom software development contracts  media and shipping  and product documentation  which is provided online 
other hosted applications revenues declined million  or  during and million  or  during essentially no revenues were recognized during the third and fourth quarters of as previously 
table of contents announced  we discontinued tradeweave sales and inventory analysis and tradeweave logistics in mid our qrs showroom product enables vendors and private label groups to create customized  targeted on line merchandise presentations for their retail buyers 
users can perform a visual review of on line merchandise via access to a standard web browser 
in the third quarter of  we entered into a marketing relationship with magic international  a subsidiary of advanstar  inc and a leading organizer of tradeshows for the fashion and apparel industry  to establish an on line trading community  magiconline powered by qrs 
this marketing agreement was renegotiated in the third quarter of to date  revenues for our qrs showroom product have been insignificant 
cost of revenues for other hosted software applications consists primarily of allocated costs of our data center  amortization of capitalized product and service development costs and customer and technical support personnel 
the million decline in cost of revenues for other hosted applications from to is primarily the result of the inclusion in cost of revenues of the million write off of capitalized service and product development costs for qrs showroom and the impact this write off has on amortization expense in subsequent periods 
in addition  our decision to discontinue tradeweave sales and inventory analysis and tradeweave logistics reduced customer and technical support personnel costs for these hosted applications 
certain data center costs that were associated with the discontinued products and which remain fixed in the short term have been reallocated across the remaining products that utilize our self hosted data center  including qrs catalogue and hosted products within our trading community management solutions group 
cost of revenues for other hosted software applications decreased by million  or  from to due to the february restructuring efforts that substantially reduced the personnel and facility expenses for the qrs showroom product  restructuring efforts that reduced customer and technical support personnel for tradeweave sales and inventory analysis and tradeweave logistics and reduced data center costs 
these savings were offset by the million write off of capitalized product and service development costs related to the qrs showroom product discussed above see also note to the consolidated financial statements 
trading community management the trading community management solutions group includes qrs compliance link and qrs exchange products and services data exchange  internet transaction exchange  enterprise business exchange  qrs web forms  qrs managed ec and access services 
revenues consist primarily of fees charged for the transmission of standard business documents measured in kilocharacters kcs over the ibm van  monthly fees for leased line connections  and service fees to convert documents from paper to electronic format 
revenues are recognized in the month that the services are performed 
trading community management revenues declined million  or  from to the primary reason was a decline in revenues from data exchange which resulted from continued pricing pressure offset to some extent by an increase in volumes 
the volume increases were due to the addition of new customers  volume growth by existing customers  and the expansion of our product capabilities to support a broader range of available technologies  including internet  xml and as technologies  helping customers to accommodate collaboration with trading partners of any size 
in spite of these volume increases  trading community management revenues declined in each quarter during when compared to due to a decline in unit pricing  or net revenue per kilocharacter 
the unit pricing declines for these services were due primarily to competitive pressures impacting pricing for both new and existing customers 
if in future periods we are required to reduce prices further  these reductions in our net revenue per kilocharacter will reduce our trading community management revenues to the extent not offset by increased unit volume or other factors 
the decline in data exchange revenue was somewhat offset by growth in our trading community enablement solutions which support smaller trading partners  such as our qrs managed ec and qrs web forms offerings 
these two products help small and medium sized businesses effectively communicate by converting paper transactions to the electronic transmissions supported by their larger trading partners 
revenues for these two solutions totaled million for  up million  or  from the million for 
table of contents which was up million  or  from the million for revenues generated by qrs compliance link had minimal impact on total trading community management revenues 
trading community management revenues declined million  or  from to the decline was primarily due to a decline in data exchange revenues as customers responded to lower prices offered by competitors 
looking forward  as the industry continues to adopt existing and new information technologies  we expect competition and pricing pressures to increase 
we will likely continue to offer the full breadth of standardized technologies so that our customers  regardless of size  can electronically communicate across virtually any infrastructure 
included in trading community management revenues are revenues generated from services we provide to kmart and its trading partners 
kmart filed for chapter xi bankruptcy protection in january if kmart emerges from its chapter xi bankruptcy proceeding as a smaller company or is unable to successfully reorganize and ceases to exist  revenues from kmart and its trading partners  which represented less than of trading community management revenues for both and  would be substantially decreased or lost 
trading community management gross margins for improved to as compared to for despite a million decline in revenues  gross profit decreased only million primarily because of savings from our amended network services agreement with ibm and decreases in headcount costs for our customer services organization achieved from continuing efficiency improvements 
these cost decreases were partially offset by increases in costs allocated from our data center 
this new three year agreement with ibm  effective as of july   extended and enhanced our longstanding relationship and supersedes and replaces the previous agreement that was due to have expired on december  see note to the consolidated financial statements 
additional trading community management cost of revenue components include customer support services  including qrs managed ec personnel  allocated costs for our data center and other technical support personnel  and amortization of capitalized service and product development costs for technology used in our qrs managed ec operations centers 
trading community management cost of revenues include million and million of severance expense for and  respectively 
there was minimal severance expense included in trading community management cost of revenues for global services the global services solutions group consists primarily of qrs retail intelligence services sm  qrs professional services  primarily services provided to help our customers with their implementations of our licensed software products  and software maintenance for our qrs sourcing and qrs merchandising products  including post contract support services for licensed software applications  and  in  tradeweave digital photography 
we discontinued tradeweave digital photography services in september due to underperformance 
global services revenue increased million  or  in over levels  due to continued strong demand for qrs retail intelligence services sm 
qrs retail intelligence services sm revenue were million  up or million from the million in  and up  or million  from the million in during the same period  qrs professional services sm qrs professional services sm revenues declined due to the completion of engagements related to enterprise license sales made in prior periods 
the increase in global services revenue of million  or  from to was primarily attributable to the growing demand for qrs retail intelligence services sm and increased qrs professional services sm revenue associated with higher enterprise software applications sales 
this was offset by the significant decline in tradeweave digital photography revenues that were largely dependent on internet related companies 
both qrs professional services sm and software maintenance revenues will continue to be dependent  to a large extent  on new sales of our licensed software products 
cost of revenues for global services consist primarily of payroll and outsourcing costs for data collecting field personnel  software application consultants  and technical support personnel for our licensed software applications 
global services gross margins improved from negative in to in in  global services gross margins were 
the improvement in gross margin in is due to the absence of a 
table of contents million impairment loss recorded in related to the discontinuation of the tradeweave digital photography service  the deferral of million of fourth quarter revenues associated with the january kmart bankruptcy filing  and ongoing efficiency improvements in our qrs retail intelligence services sm 
global services cost of revenues include million of severance for there was minimal severance expense included in global services cost of revenues for or operating expenses the following table sets forth the operating expenses and the related percentages of total revenues of the company and a breakdown of full time headcount by sales and marketing  service and product development and general and administrative for the years ended december    and dollars in thousands amount amount amount operating expenses sales and marketing service and product development general and administrative operating expenses  before amortization of goodwill and other intangible assets and other non recurring operating expenses amortization of other intangible assets amortization of goodwill in process research and development restructuring expenses impairment loss total operating expenses headcount at year end sales and marketing service and product development general and administrative overview operating expenses  before amortization and other non recurring operating expenses  declined from million in to million in  reflecting our focus on cost controls and operational discipline during the last year 
total operating expenses declined much more significantly due to the inclusion in results of significant charges for restructuring expenses and impairment losses 
in addition  amortization expense was also reduced because the impairment losses significantly reduced the value of goodwill and other intangible assets and  to a lesser extent  because of the cessation of goodwill amortization under statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
fas  goodwill and other intangible assets 
from to  operating expenses before amortization and other non recurring operating expenses increased due to increased service and product development expenses 
total operating expense increased significantly from to due to increased amortization  restructuring and impairment charges 
total operating expenses include million  million and million of severance for  and  respectively 
while we will continue our aggressive approach to cost management  our million fourth quarter operating expense level is approaching the expected run rate for 
table of contents sales and marketing expenses sales and marketing expenses consist primarily of personnel and related costs in our sales and marketing organizations as well as the costs of various marketing programs 
at december   we sold our products and services to the global marketplace primarily through our direct field sales force and our telesales group 
at december   we had full time employees in our sales and marketing groups  compared to at the end of and at the end of our sales and marketing expenses declined million  or  from to the decline was due primarily to a million decline in our provision for doubtful accounts together with decreased provisions for sales commissions  decreased stock based compensation expense  declines in headcount and cost savings produced from the renegotiation of our marketing agreement with advanstar 
we incurred million and million of severance expense in sales and marketing during and  respectively 
there was minimal severance expense in sales and marketing during our sales and marketing expenses remained essentially flat in total and as a percentage of revenues in when compared to during  we had stock based compensation expense related to the restricted stock program 
we also increased the level of sales operations in europe and increased our domestic sales force to focus specifically on software applications 
the costs associated with these operational expansions were offset entirely by cost savings realized from the integration of our subsidiary  tradeweave  inc  in february service and product development expenses service and product development expenditures consist primarily of personnel  consulting and equipment costs related to research  development and enhancements of our enterprise software and hosted software applications  qrs web forms solution  and other software for internal use at our qrs managed ec operations centers  a portion of which is capitalized under american institute of certified public accountants aicpa statement of position sop  accounting for costs of computer software developed or obtained for internal use 
at december   we had full time employees in our service and product development groups  compared to at the end of and at the end of during the years and  we supplemented our internal development resources through arrangements with several outsourced development companies 
the service and product development expense amounts in the foregoing table of million  million and million for  and  respectively  are net of capitalized service and product development costs that totaled million  million and million in  and  respectively 
for our licensed software applications that were introduced in the first quarter of  capitalized amounts under sfas no 
 accounting for the costs of computer software to be sold  leased  or otherwise marketed  are immaterial because products and enhancements have generally reached technological feasibility and have been released for sale at substantially the same time 
for our hosted software applications which include qrs catalogue and qrs showroom  we capitalize  as prescribed by the sop  all the costs incurred during the application development stage  which include designing the software configuration and interfaces  coding  installation and testing 
after adding back the capitalized amounts to service and product development expenses  actual spending has been up slightly each of the last two years  despite the decline in headcount  at million in  million in  and million in service and product development expenses also reflect million and million in severance for and  respectively 
there was no severance expense included in service and product development expenses in in future quarters  we will increase our service and product development expenditures in general  with a specific focus on improvements to our qrs catalogue and on the development and upgrading of our product technology and architecture 
during and part of  we plan to utilize internal resources to develop a new base technology platform which will help qrs more rapidly and efficiently deliver solutions that bring value to our customers 
we intend to continue parallel development and enhancement efforts to our current products on 
table of contents their current technology platforms while building the new base platform 
while our current plan is to perform these development efforts using internal resources  we are simultaneously evaluating opportunities to accelerate development  including through alliances  licensing  and strategic acquisitions 
our platform investment will create an engine for common processes and functions for qrs applications 
the improvements to our qrs catalogue will allow us to better service non general merchandise and apparel retail segments and to move beyond our capabilities in data synchronization 
we believe expanded capabilities for our qrs catalogue application will help position us to address the emerging needs of new segments 
should we complete this development effort exclusively with internal resources  we currently expect to increase the headcount in our service and product development group by approximately people during as a result  we estimate that our total service and product development expenditures in will be approximately million  of which approximately million  representing the estimated expenditures for the platform development and improvements to qrs catalogue  are expected to be capitalized in accordance with the provisions of aicpa sop no 
amortization of these expenditures will begin when the newly developed products are released to production  which is expected to occur in to the extent we license or acquire this or other complementary technologies or businesses to accelerate development  we would expect to invest less in internal service and product development resources 
also during  we intend to upgrade the application server and database technology of our qrs sourcing application 
we plan on adding additional functionality to the web enabled version of the qrs sourcing application and on developing an application toolset to allow our customers and third parties to perform basic modifications to and extensions of the product 
general and administrative expenses general and administrative expenses consist primarily of the personnel and related costs of our administrative organizations  such as finance  legal  human resources  and mis  as well as professional fees and other costs 
at december   we had full time employees in our general and administrative groups  compared to at the end of  and at the end of general and administrative expenses declined by million  or  from to  despite an increase in headcount  due to a decrease in consulting  facilities and telecommunications expenses resulting from cost controls and our restructuring efforts 
this decline reflects our ongoing efforts to improve efficiency in the general and administrative area 
significant additional spending in legal  accounting and internal controls  driven in part by new regulatory requirements  offset the decline in general and administrative expenses 
we expect to incur additional costs in in connection with our internal controls systems to address ongoing business needs as well as to continue compliance with evolving regulatory requirements 
general and administrative expenses declined by million  or  from to this reduction was due primarily to a reduction in headcount  offset by additional recruitment expense for senior management  stock based compensation expense related to the restricted stock program  and accruals for estimated losses  the majority of which was charged to general and administrative expense 
general and administrative expenses included million  million and million of severance in  and  respectively 
amortization of other intangible assets and goodwill amortization of intangible assets consists primarily of amortization of other intangible assets  including current technology  trade names  customer lists and non compete agreements 
amortization of other intangible assets was million in  million in and million in on january   we adopted fas and ceased amortizing goodwill  which had a remaining balance  after the recognition of the impairment loss  of million as of december   which included million of acquired workforce previously included in other intangible assets 
amortization of goodwill was million in and million in the increases in amortization of intangible assets from to were primarily due to the timing of the acquisitions as outlined in the following schedule in thousands 
we recorded 
table of contents impairment losses of million during the year ended december  related to the write down of intangible assets including goodwill associated with these acquisitions see note to consolidated financial statements 
acquisition acquisition date goodwill other intangible assets total intangible assets retail data services  inc and rds  inc 
rds july  image info inc image info january  rockport trade systems  inc rockport march  tradeweave  inc tradeweave  minority interest february  in process research and development in connection with the acquisitions of rockport trade systems  inc and image info in  we expensed million million for image info and million for rockport  representing and of the purchase prices  respectively of in process research and development related to eight software applications research projects under development for which technological feasibility had not been established as of the acquisition dates 
the value of each project was determined through the income approach  which involved discounting cash flows to be derived from the future products to present value using discount rates ranging from to 
the discount rates were developed by computing the weighted average cost of capital of established companies similar in operations and then increased to reflect the additional risk for technology under development since these projects have not reached technological feasibility 
the revenue and expense projections were based on historical trends and future expectations for the acquired companies and qrs 
these projects have been completed and the actual costs were in line with estimates 
restructuring expenses on february   we announced a reorganization plan that included the full integration of the operations of qrs and tradeweave see note to consolidated financial statements and an alignment of our organization with a single go to market strategy focused on enhanced synergies within qrs with resulting cost reductions 
in connection with the implementation of the february reorganization  we recorded restructuring expenses of million during the year ended december   comprised of severance of million and accelerated stock based compensation expense of million for involuntary terminations throughout qrs  and a facilities closure expense of million 
during september  we discontinued our tradeweave digital photography service due to underperformance 
as a result  we recorded restructuring expenses of million during the year ended december   comprised of severance of  for involuntary terminations within the tradeweave digital photography group  and facilities closure expense of million 
additionally  during the fourth quarter of  we restructured our operations  which included the realignment and certain eliminations of our products and services  the elimination of full time positions and the consolidation of real estate 
as a result  we recorded restructuring expenses of million during the quarter ended december   comprised of severance of million for involuntary terminations throughout qrs  and facilities closure expense of million 
as of december   the accrued liability related to our business restructuring was million  comprised of severance of million and sublease loss accruals of million 
we expect to pay the remaining severance liability in full by the second quarter of  and the remaining obligation related to our termination of non cancelable leases will be paid over the respective lease terms through fiscal our restructuring initiatives in resulted in operating expense reductions of approximately million in real estate and salary expense in we had estimated expense reductions of between and million 
restructuring expenses include stock based compensation expense related to accelerated vesting under the restricted stock program 

table of contents impairment loss during and  we formed an internet start up company  tradeweave  inc tradeweave 
we also completed three acquisitions to expand our product and service offerings for our existing customers  as well as to penetrate new markets within the retail industry beyond the general merchandise and apparel segment which represents the majority of our historical business 
in  we established tradeweave as a separate legal entity in order to attract top employees and to minimize the launch time for its products which included an on line marketplace for the disposition of surplus and mark down apparel 
mr 
peter johnson  the then chairman of the board of directors  and mr 
garth saloner  a director  purchased a minority interest in this company and were directors of this company 
by late  tradeweave s solution had evolved to address the full retail cycle 
in order to implement a single go to market strategy and to fully integrate the products and services of tradeweave and qrs  we decided to merge their business into ours 
in february  we acquired the minority interest in our subsidiary tradeweave  inc and completed a reorganization which resulted in cost savings as the result of headcount reductions and office facility consolidations see note to consolidated financial statements 
as a result of this related party transaction we recorded goodwill and other intangible assets of million see note to consolidated financial statements 
in july  we purchased rds  a national market research and data management firm dedicated to the collection  verification and analysis of competitive retail pricing  promotion and distribution information primarily to grocery retailers 
this acquisition added million universal product codes to the qrs catalogue and was intended to add additional data elements to the qrs catalogue such as nutrifacts and other price information 
this acquisition added most of the top us grocery chains as customers 
in january  we purchased image info to offer imaging software and services to our customers 
our retailer and vendor customers needed advanced imaging solutions to display images on their internet sites  as well as to use internally for a wide variety of inventory management and marketing purposes 
image info was intended to expand the functionality of qrs catalogue through the addition of digital images as well as provide value added content and imaging to tradeweave showroom now qrs showroom 
the transaction was expected to enhance qrs current recurring revenue streams 
in march  we acquired rockport trade systems  inc rockport to offer an expanded portfolio of product selection  direct procurement  purchasing  costing  financial and logistics software applications targeted to meet the global trading needs of retailers  vendors  manufacturers and service providers 
the rockport products and services were intended to leverage existing products and services and allow us to offer complete electronic commerce services to our customers and prospects around the world and throughout the retail supply chain 
during the third quarter of  we recognized an impairment loss of million associated with our tradeweave digital photography service which was acquired in connection with the acquisition of image info in january the impairment loss was determined based on an analysis performed by american appraisal associates  inc  independent appraiser  and was comprised of the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets of million  and the write off of the carrying amount of property and equipment of million  which was included in cost of revenues 
the property and equipment written off was primarily comprised of tenant improvements for the closure of our new york photography studio as well as photographic equipment 
because tradeweave digital photography revenues were largely dependent on internet related companies  we saw a significant decline in revenues during in addition  the impairment loss during the third quarter ended september  also included a charge of million related to the write off of the value of a web portal  which was under construction 
during the fourth quarter of  under the leadership of new management  we initiated a comprehensive strategic review of our products and services and market opportunities 
in consideration of the current tightening in information technology spending and uncertainties in the marketplace along with analysis performed by american appraisal associates  inc  we concluded that future cash flows from the assets acquired in connection with our acquisitions of rockport  image info  rds and tradeweave would not be sufficient to recover the 
table of contents carrying amount of the acquired goodwill and other intangible and tangible assets 
therefore  we recorded an impairment loss of million for the year ended december   comprised of the write down of goodwill and other intangible assets of million associated with the qrs sourcing product acquired in connection with our acquisition of rockport  million associated with the qrs merchandising product acquired in connection with our acquisition of image info  million associated with qrs retail intelligence services sm acquired in connection with our acquisition of rds  million associated with the qrs showroom product which was recorded in connection with our acquisition of the tradeweave minority interest  and write off of the carrying amount of tenant improvements and other assets of million  of which million is included in cost of revenues 
we recognized an additional impairment loss of million which is included in cost of revenues related to the write off of capitalized service and product development costs related to the qrs showroom product as the result of an impairment analysis 
as a result of this impairment loss  the remaining carrying value of goodwill and other intangible assets at december  was million and million  respectively 
the million in other intangible assets includes million related to the rockport and image info acquisitions 
our adoption of fas has not had a material effect on our financial position and results of operations 
interest income interest income consists primarily of interest earned on cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities 
interest income was million in  million in  and million in changes in interest income reflect the level of average balances in each year and a decrease in marketable securities yields 
interest expense interest expense was million in and consisted of interest incurred from our note payable and capital lease obligation see notes and to consolidated financial statements 
income tax benefit we recorded an income tax benefit of million  million and million for fiscal  and  respectively 
the income tax benefit for as a percentage of pre tax loss reflects the non deductibility of purchase accounting amounts related to the acquisitions of rockport and image info 
our effective income tax rate was for  for and for in  we established a valuation allowance for our deferred tax assets due to uncertainties related to our ability to utilize some of our deferred tax assets  primarily consisting of certain net operating losses carryforward  before they expire 
liquidity and capital resources the increase of million in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities available for sale from december  to december  resulted primarily from cash flows from operations of million offset by payments for capital expenditures of million and the capitalization of service and product development costs of million 
working capital increased by million as a result of a decrease in current liabilities of million offset by a decrease in current assets of million from december  to december  the principal reasons for these changes in working capital were the increase in cash collections  which decreased the accounts receivable balance by million as days sales outstanding dsos decreased to days at december  from days at december   and a decrease in accounts payable of million mainly due to payments under our network services contract with ibm 
total assets decreased from million at december  to million at december  primarily due to the decrease in net accounts receivable of million and the decrease in net property and equipment of million 
total liabilities decreased from million at december  to million at december   primarily due to the reduction in our sublease loss accruals by million and accounts payable by million 

table of contents we have recently incurred significant losses  including net losses of million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
a substantial amount of these losses in were in connection with non cash charges relating to the impairment of remaining intangible assets  including technology and goodwill  acquired through our acquisitions in recent years of rockport trade systems inc  image info inc  and retail services inc  as well as our acquisition of the outstanding minority interest of tradeweave inc in addition  for the fiscal year ended december  we experienced a decline in revenues of over the previous fiscal year 
we offset this revenue decline by reducing our operating expenses in such that for the third and fourth quarters ended september  and december   our revenues exceeded our expenses 
we may not be able to continue reducing our operating expenses in future periods while our revenues may continue to decline 
as a result  we may experience losses in future periods 
during  a significant portion of our cash inflows was generated by our operations 
because our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of decreases in customer demand or decreases in acceptance of our future products  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 
to the extent that our operating results fall below our expectations  we may need to obtain debt financing or sell additional shares of our equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
we believe that cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities available for sale at december  and cash forecasted to be generated from future operations will be sufficient to meet our working capital needs and capital expenditures anticipated by our operating plan 
based on this plan  we anticipate that cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities to decline during the expected decline in cash  cash equivalents and marketable securities is primarily attributable to the following factors the planned million of investment in the platform development and improvements to qrs catalogue  additional cash payments on the real estate and severance restructuring accruals  on other severance obligations and on other payables outstanding at december   and payments on the unsecured promissory note to ibm  among other items 
we expect our investment in the platform development and improvements to qrs catalogue to occur throughout the year as additional spending coincides with the additional headcount in our service and product development area 
while our current plan is to perform these development efforts using internal resources  we are simultaneously evaluating opportunities to accelerate development  including through alliances  licensing  and strategic acquisitions 
to the extent we license or acquire this or other complementary technologies or businesses  which require additional cash utilization  we may seek to sell additional debt or equity securities  which may result in additional dilution to our stockholders 
however  we cannot be certain that additional funding will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
on april   we announced that our board of directors had authorized the repurchase from time to time of up to million of our common stock in both open market and block transactions 
our board of directors authorized a million increase in this repurchase amount on october   and an additional increase of million on may   for a total of million 
shares purchased under this program will be held in the corporate treasury for future use including employee stock option grants and the employee stock purchase plan 
we may discontinue purchases of our common stock at any time that management determines additional purchases are not warranted 
we repurchased  shares of our common stock for million during the year ended december  as further described in note of the consolidated financial statements  we have repurchased a total of  shares of our common stock for a total consideration of million in the stock buyback program 
while we presently have no plans for further stock repurchases  we may decide to take such actions at a future date  which would reduce our cash  cash equivalents  and marketable securities available for sale 
given the length of time since the share repurchase authorizations  any repurchases of our shares would be preceded by additional approval from our board of directors 
we have no plans to pay dividends with respect to our common stock in the foreseeable future 

table of contents during  a significant portion of our cash inflows was generated by our operations 
because our operating results may fluctuate significantly as a result of decreases in customer demand or decreases in acceptance of our future products  our ability to generate positive cash flow from operations may be jeopardized 
at december   future payments under contractual arrangements and total lease obligations are as follows in thousands minimum lease commitments deferred acquisition payment severance vendor commitments total year ending december thereafter total minimum lease commitments for vacant facilities that are available for sublease are included in these amounts 
income received from subleased real property is excluded from these amounts 
represents accrued acquisition payment to the former shareholders of image info that is in dispute and is the subject of ongoing litigation see note to consolidated financial statements 
critical accounting policies our critical accounting policies are as follows revenue recognition service and product development costs  identifiable intangible assets and goodwill use of estimates income taxes revenue recognition our revenue recognition policy is described in note  summary of significant accounting policies to our consolidated financial statements  which are included in item of this annual report on form k 
for all of our revenues  we use our judgment to determine whether revenues are appropriately recorded on a gross basis fees are fixed or determinable collection is probable  including when revenue is recognized in advance of billing depending on the facts and circumstances of revenue contracts and customer credit worthiness  both the timing and the amount of revenue to be recognized can be affected by our judgments 
we derive our revenue from three principal sources software applications software applications revenues represented of our revenues in revenues consist primarily of fees charged for qrs catalogue  a hosted application  and revenues from the sale of enterprise software license applications 

table of contents revenues for qrs catalogue are recognized in the month that the services are performed based on fixed or determinable prices identified in a standard license agreement 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and credit worthiness 
revenues for enterprise software applications are recognized in accordance with sop  software revenue recognition 
from time to time  customers may request that we amend certain terms of our standard agreement or negotiate a software license contract separate from our standard software license agreement 
these contacts may be material in relation to our total enterprise software applications revenues 
negotiation of contractual terms with customers may be protracted and any deviation from our standard terms can impact the timing of revenue recognition 
in certain instances  we have deferred recognition of revenue from our enterprise software applications after entering into a license agreement when factors such as the following exist contractual requirements to deliver either unspecified additional products or specified product upgrades for which we do not have vendor specific objective evidence of fair value  payment terms due after our normal payment terms  contracts where collectibility from the customer is not reasonably assured  and contracts involving acceptance clauses 
our contracts may contain multiple elements or may require us to develop additional features or functionality for our customers 
in cases where vendor specific objective evidence exists for all undelivered elements  we account for the delivered elements in accordance with the residual method prescribed by sop  modification of sop  software revenue recognition with respect to certain transactions 
this means that we defer revenue equivalent to the fair value of the undelivered elements until such time as the element is delivered to the customer 
fair values for the ongoing support obligations are based on separate sales of support renewals sold to customers or on renewal rates quoted in the contracts 
fair value of services  such as training or consulting  is based on the value of stand alone sales of these services to customers 
to the extent that we do not have vendor specific evidence for undelivered contract elements  revenue is deferred until the undelivered elements are delivered to the customer 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and credit worthiness 
we generally do not require collateral from our customers and our bad debt experience has not been significant in relation to our overall revenues 
if collection is not reasonably assured  revenue is deferred and recognized at the time collection becomes reasonably assured  which is generally on receipt of cash 
if an arrangement includes an acceptance provision  acceptance occurs on the earlier of receipt of a written customer acceptance or expiration of the acceptance period and revenue is not recognized until the time of acceptance 
trading community management trading community management revenues represented of our revenues in revenues consist primarily of fees charged for the transmission of standard business documents measured in kilocharacters kcs over the ibm van  monthly fees for leased line connections  and service fees to convert documents from paper to electronic format 
revenues are recognized in the month that the services are performed 
based on the type of service provided  the evidence of arrangement for these services varies  between a service order and a standard written contract 
all of these arrangements contain fixed or determinable prices for volumes or types of services 
we rely on ibm to provide information to us about the volumes of kcs delivered to our customers 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and credit worthiness 
based on our historical experience  a small portion of our customers request credits for service or billing related issues 
we examine each request and when the claim is bona fide  we adjust the customer s account 
as a result  we provide a reserve against revenues for customer credits related to service or billing 
table of contents issues 
the reserve is based on actual experience and an estimate based on the prior six months actual experience 
at no time during the year was the reserve greater than of trading community management revenues 
global services global services revenues represented of our revenues in global services revenues consist of qrs retail intelligence services sm  qrs professional services sm and software application customer support and maintenance 
fees for qrs retail intelligence services sm and qrs professional services sm are recognized as the related services are performed 
software maintenance revenue is deferred and recognized on a straight line basis over the life of the related contract  which is typically one year 
based on the type of service provided  the evidence of arrangement for these services varies  between a service order and a standard written contract 
all of these arrangements contain fixed or determinable prices for each type of service 
we assess collectibility based on a number of factors  including past transaction history and credit worthiness 
service and product development costs  identifiable intangible assets  and goodwill we assess the impairment of identifiable intangible and long lived assets including capitalized service and product development costs whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not be recoverable 
factors we consider important which could trigger an impairment review include the following significant underperformance relative to expected historical or projected future operating results  significant changes in the manner of our use of the acquired assets or the strategy for our overall business  significant negative industry or economic trends  significant decline in our stock price for a sustained period  and our market capitalization relative to net book value 
in performing our review for recoverability of identifiable intangible and long lived assets  we estimate the future cash flows expected to result from the use and eventual disposition of those assets 
when we estimate the future cash flows from those assets  we use our judgment to determine the assumptions underlying the estimates 
to determine revenue estimates  we assess the future market potential for our products and our expected product market share 
additionally  we make judgments about our future operating costs  interest rates  and our cost of capital as well as the economic life of the assets 
our judgments are based on the company s experience as well as consultation with external advisors 
if the actual results differ from those estimates  the carrying amount of certain assets may not be recoverable 
net intangible assets  goodwill and capitalized service and product development costs amounted to million as of december  additionally  at least annually  we perform a review of the potential impairment of goodwill 
in performing our review of the recoverability of goodwill  we compare the net book value of the company to its market capitalization after considering any impairment to identifiable intangibles and long lived assets 
goodwill amounted to million as of december  use of estimates the preparation of our financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles necessarily requires that we make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the balance sheet dates and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses for the periods presented 
areas where management makes estimates and assumptions include  but are not limited to  allowance for doubtful accounts  sublease loss reserve  valuation allowance for deferred taxes  long lived and intangible asset lives  and the establishment of accrued liabilities 
actual results could differ from these estimates 

table of contents we must make estimates as to the overall collectibility of accounts receivable and provide an allowance for amounts deemed to be uncollectible 
we analyze accounts receivable balances  historical bad debt trends  current economic conditions  and specific customer experience when evaluating the adequacy of the allowance for doubtful accounts 
at december  and  our allowance for doubtful accounts balance was million and million  respectively 
the calculation of the estimated sublease loss reserve for vacated facilities requires that we make estimates of potential future sublease income 
we analyze current market conditions for real estate with the assistance of reputable commercial real estate brokers 
however  future actual sublease income may materially differ from estimated amounts as a result of the timing of obtaining a sub lease tenant and the amount of the sub lease income 
currently  we have one vacated facility that is not yet sub leased 
we expect to sub lease this facility by january for each month beyond january during which the property is not sub leased  the company would incur an additional million of expense 
the current estimated sub lease income is approximately of the lease rate 
if this facility was to be sub leased at of the leased rate  we would incur  over the life of the lease  an additional million in expense annually 
our current estimated range of liability related to pending litigation and asserted claims is based on claims for which we can estimate the amount or range of loss 
we analyze the merits of claims and obtain assistance from outside counsel in order to arrive at our estimates 
we have recorded the probable settlement amount and associated legal fees related to those claims  and where there is a range of loss and no amount in the range is any more probable than another  we record the low end of the range as our estimate of the probable outcome 
income taxes we account for income taxes using the asset and liability method under sfas no 
fas  accounting for income taxes 
this involves estimating current tax expense and temporary differences resulting from the different treatment of items for tax and accounting purposes 
these differences result in deferred tax assets and liabilities 
additionally  we must assess the likelihood that deferred tax assets will be recovered as deductions from future taxable income 
to the extent that recovery is not more likely than not  we establish a valuation allowance 
we use our judgment to determine the amount of the income tax provision and any valuation allowance to be recorded against the deferred tax assets 
for and  we determined that a valuation allowance was necessary to reduce the deferred tax assets to the amount of deferred tax liabilities 
during  the valuation allowance increased million to million 
recent accounting pronouncements in july  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no

the disclosure requirements of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods ending after december  we have adopted the disclosure provisions of fin see note to the consolidated financial statements 
we have not yet determined the maximum potential future exposure resulting from these guarantees and indemnifications 

table of contents in november  the eitf reached a consensus on issue no

fin requires that if a business enterprise has a controlling financial interest in a variable interest entity  the assets  liabilities  and results of the activities of the variable interest entity must be included in the consolidated financial statements with those of the business enterprise 
fin applies immediately to variable interest entities created after january  and to variable interest entities in which an enterprise obtains an interest after that date 
we do not have any ownership in any variable interest entities as of december  risks relating to our business an investment in our common stock involves risks and uncertainties 
investors evaluating us and our business should carefully consider the factors described below and all other information contained in this annual report on form k before purchasing our common stock 
any of the following factors could materially harm our business  operating results and financial condition  as well as additional factors and uncertainties not currently known to us or that we currently consider immaterial 
investors could lose all or part of their investment as a result of these factors 
the economic slowdown and changes in the retail industry make our future operating results uncertain 
historically  we have generated all of our revenues from the sale of products and services to the retail industry 
the retail industry is experiencing a marked slowdown that we believe has been caused by the general economic downturn since and uncertain global  geopolitical  military and economic factors 
we believe that continuing poor economic conditions and increased competition in the retail industry are negatively impacting the industry and our customers ability and willingness to pay for our products and services 
these adverse conditions continue to negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services to existing and potential customers in the retail industry 
the department store sector of the general merchandise and apparel segment  which is an important part of our customer base for our trading community management and qrs catalogue products and services  has been particularly affected by these adverse conditions  and our products and services are less well established in other sectors of the general merchandise and apparel segment  such as mass merchants 
if the department store sector continues to experience greater challenges or adversity than other sectors  our business  financial condition and results of operations would be adversely affected 
we believe that the retail industry is consolidating 
during the third quarter of  one of our major retail customers consolidated certain of its retail operations 
moreover  we expect that retailers will continue to reorganize their operations in attempts to improve operating efficiencies 
to the extent that such reorganizations reduce the number of their retail operations  the number of our trading partnerships could also be reduced  which 
table of contents may reduce net sales in future periods and could have a material adverse impact on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
such weakening economic conditions in the retail industry and consolidation have in the past  and may in the future  negatively impact our ability to sell our products and services to existing and potential customers in the retail industry 
the loss of any large retail or vendor customer may also result in our loss of all of the trading partners of that retailer or vendor that are also our customers  which would have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
in addition  the licensing of our enterprise software applications involves substantial capital expenditures by our retail customers 
as a result of the economic slowdown in the retail industry  we believe that our current and potential retailer customers have been  and will be less likely to  make such capital expenditures 
unless the retail industry recovers from its current economic slowdown  our business  operating results and financial condition may continue to suffer materially 
even if conditions in the retail industry do improve  the extended economic downturn may have changed purchasing preferences for software products in ways that we cannot predict 
we have experienced significant losses in recent fiscal periods and may experience losses in future periods 
we have recently incurred significant losses  including net losses of million and million for the fiscal years ended december  and  respectively 
a substantial amount of these losses in were in connection with non cash charges relating to the impairment of remaining intangible assets  including technology and goodwill  acquired through our acquisitions in recent years of rockport trade systems inc  image info inc  and retail data services inc  as well as our acquisition of the outstanding minority interest of tradeweave inc we may continue to incur non cash charges related to the impairment of other intangible assets  as well as non cash charges related to stock compensation 
further impairment of intangible assets could occur since the revenue and income potential of some of our services and products are unproven  and some of the markets we are addressing are in the early stages of development 
there can be no assurance that new services and products introduced by us will gain market acceptance  or that new technologies or business methods will not be developed that replace or reduce the importance of our current offerings  and thus there can be no assurance that we will not need to take additional impairment charges 
in addition  for the fiscal year ended december  we experienced a decline in revenues of over the previous fiscal year 
we offset this revenue decline by reducing our operating expenses in such that for the third and fourth quarters ended september  and december   our revenues exceeded our expenses 
we may not be able to continue reducing our operating expenses in future periods while our revenues may continue to decline 
as a result  we may experience losses in future periods 
to the extent that our operating results fall below our expectations  we may need to obtain debt financing or sell additional shares of our equity securities 
there can be no assurance that we will be able to obtain debt or equity financing on terms acceptable to us or at all 
our failure to obtain sufficient funds on acceptable terms when needed could have a material adverse effect on our ability to achieve our intended business objectives 
we have recently experienced significant changes in our senior management team 
in recent years we have experienced significant turnover in our management team 
our current president and chief executive officer joined us in october  and our current chief financial officer joined us in january other members of management have also joined us only recently  and the management team as a whole has had a very limited time to work together 
a number of executives have also left the company 
our success depends on the performance of our executive officers and other key employees and the ability of our management team to work together effectively 
there can be no assurance that the management team will be able to work together effectively  that we can continue to retain or recruit necessary additional personnel  or that such new personnel will be efficiently integrated or be adequate for our current or future operations 

table of contents our industry is characterized by rapid technological change  and there are risks associated with new product development 
the increasing use of the internet as a communications medium has rapidly changed the competitive environment of our industry 
the supply chain management industry is now characterized by rapid technological innovation and a long term trend towards internet based communications over proprietary value added network van based communications 
while we continue to develop solutions that take advantage of the internet s potential  the majority of our trading community management revenues for the foreseeable future are expected to be derived from our traditional van based edi services 
the future success of our services and products will depend  in part  on our ability to continue developing products and services that are compatible with the internet 
the increased commercial use of the internet could require substantial modification and customization of our services and products and the introduction of new services and products 
our competitors and potential competitors may develop competing technologies that are more effective or more effectively marketed than the services and products marketed by us or that render our services or products obsolete or noncompetitive 
in addition  the markets for our software applications are subject to rapid technological change  changing client needs  frequent new product introductions and evolving industry standards that may render existing products and services obsolete 
our growth and future operating results will depend  in part  on our ability to enhance existing applications and develop and introduce new applications or capabilities 
our product development and testing efforts have required  and are expected to continue to require  substantial investments 
we may not possess sufficient resources to continue to make the necessary investments in technology 
in addition  we may not successfully identify new software applications  or bring new software to market in a timely and efficient manner 
if we are unable to develop and introduce new and enhanced software in a timely manner  we may lose existing customers to our competitors and fail to attract new customers  which may adversely affect our performance and results of operations 
we may not successfully complete our development of a new technology platform or improvements to our qrs catalogue  and the conversion of customers  products and services to this new platform may experience problems or be unsuccessful 
in and  we expect to significantly increase our investment in services and product development  including projected expenditures during of million for the development of a new technology platform and improvements to qrs catalogue to address the needs of the non general merchandise and apparel retail segments 
we believe that the successful development of the platform and improvement of qrs catalogue is important to our future success in continuing to sell products and services to our existing customers and expanding our presence in new retail sectors and geographies 
we do not have experience in developing a technology platform of the magnitude and complexity planned for our new technology platform 
if the complexity is greater than anticipated or we are unable to recruit and retain individuals with the necessary skills  we may be unable to build the technology platform at all or in the time expected or at an appropriate cost 
delays or a failure in the development of a technology platform or improvements to the qrs catalogue may have an adverse effect on our performance and operating results 
if we do complete the platform  we may not be able to convert our customers from existing technologies to the new platform quickly or without problems 
in addition  we have less expertise and experience with the non general merchandise and apparel retail segments  which could lead to difficulty obtaining market acceptance of the improvements 
our business is marked by substantial price competition 
the changed technological landscape and the desire of companies to obtain market share has resulted in very strong and continuing price competition  particularly for our data exchange products and services 
this competition has caused us from time to time to reduce prices on these services 
we expect that as the retail industry continues to adopt existing and new information technologies  competition and pricing pressures will increase  and our competitors may adopt new pricing and sales models to which we are unable to adopt or 
table of contents adequately respond 
if we are forced to effect further price reductions in connection with such increased competition  such reductions would reduce net sales in future periods to the extent not offset by increased unit sales or other factors 
price reductions in response to competitive pressures could have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
the market for business to business electronic commerce services in the retail industry is intensely competitive 
numerous other companies participate in the supply chain management industry generally 
some of our competitors and potential competitors have longer operating histories  greater brand recognition  larger customer bases and greater financial and other resources with which to improve and aggressively market their products 
in addition  new competitors  such as standards based organizations or consortia  may enter the market 
our competitors and potential competitors may develop or adapt to  and market  competing technologies more effectively than we do 
a number of our competitors are now under new ownership 
we cannot predict the impact of such changed ownership on how these entities may compete with us in the future 
in addition  some larger potential customers have chosen to develop their own supply chain management systems internally rather than to utilize the service and product offerings of external providers 
all of these competitive factors may adversely affect our business 
we have experienced difficulty in effectively integrating and managing acquired companies and their products 
in  we acquired image info  inc and rockport trade systems  inc  companies whose products included software applications 
in early  we acquired the minority interest of our subsidiary  tradeweave  inc and integrated its operations into ours 
in september  we discontinued our tradeweave digital photography service  which had been acquired through our acquisition of image info inc in january we have limited experience in integrating and managing acquired companies and selling products such as enterprise software applications and related services  such as those acquired from rockport trade systems  inc moreover  certain of these acquired services and products do not fit in our traditional network based recurring revenue business model 
revenues to date from products obtained through these acquisitions have been below our expectations at the times of the acquisitions resulting in the recognition of a significant impairment loss at the end of we continue to evaluate the recoverability of the remaining intangible asset 
we may experience additional impairment losses in the future 
if we are unable to successfully integrate or manage other acquired companies and their products  our business  results of operations and financial condition may be harmed 
we may continue to enter into mergers 
we may choose to continue to acquire new solutions or to expand our market presence through mergers  acquisitions  joint ventures or other strategic alliances with  or investments in  third parties 
there are a number of risks associated with such transactions  such as the difficulty of assimilating the operations  technology and personnel of the combined companies  the potential disruption of our ongoing business  the diversion of attention of management  the inability to retain key technical and managerial personnel  additional expenses associated with the amortization or impairment of acquired intangible assets  the potential use of cash or assumption of additional debt  and or a potential issuance of equity which could be dilutive to existing stockholders  the maintenance of uniform standards  controls and policies  and the impairment of relationships with existing employees and customers 
we may not succeed in overcoming these risks or any other potential problems encountered in connection with such mergers or other transactions  and such transactions may have a material adverse effect on our business  financial condition and results of operations 
our operating results may fluctuate from quarter to quarter 
we anticipate that our results of operations may fluctuate for the foreseeable future due to several factors  including changes in the demand for our services and the use of our existing services  changes in customer buying patterns  changes in our pricing policies or those of our competitors  market acceptance of new and 
table of contents enhanced versions of our services and products  changes in operating expenses  changes in our strategy  introduction of alternative technologies by our competitors  effect of potential acquisitions and the integration and management of acquired products  and industry and general global and economic factors 
in addition  our limited operating history with enterprise software application licensing makes accurate prediction of future operating results difficult or impossible 
we have experienced  and may experience in one or more future quarters  operating results that are below the expectations of public market analysts and investors 
in such an event  the price of our common stock has been  and would likely be  materially and adversely affected 
in addition  the period between initial contact and the implementation of our enterprise software application products is often lengthy and subject to a number of factors that may cause significant delays 
these factors include the size and complexity of the overall project and delays in our customers implementation of web based computing environments 
a significant portion of any qrs sourcing revenues realized in a quarter is typically derived from a small number of license sales 
as a result  the timing of any enterprise software license revenue is difficult to predict  and we are subject to significant variations in license revenues 
delays or cancellations of sales or implementations of even a few license transactions have had  and may have  a material adverse effect on our business  operating results and financial condition  and have caused  and may continue to cause  our operating results to vary significantly from quarter to quarter 
because our products and services are complex and perform mission critical functions  we are vulnerable to product defect and product related claims 
our software products are complex and perform critical functions for our customers  and consequently carry inherent risks 
for example  our software products may contain undetected errors or failures when first introduced or as new versions are released 
the possibility for program errors and failures may increase due to factors including the use of new technologies  the integration of third party software  or the need for more rapid product development that is characteristic of the software market 
we undergo pre release product testing by our current and potential customers to minimize risks  and our customer license agreements typically contain provisions designed to limit our exposure to potential product related claims 
nevertheless  such provisions may not always be enforced or enforceable in the various legal jurisdictions in which we operate 
there can be no assurance that any errors or failures by our products and services will not subject us to substantial product related claims 
we are dependent on the ibm value added network and the bes it formerly iddx service 
pursuant to a contract with ibm that expires on june   we use the ibm value added network van as the network platform over which we provide customers with most of our qrs exchange products and services 
we depend on the ibm van for a substantial part of our revenues 
under this contract we also offer as our internet transaction exchange product the ibm business exchange services internet transfer bes it  formerly internet data and document exchange iddx service  an internet protocol ip based transaction network allowing for real time information exchange over the internet 
upon the expiration of our contract with ibm  in the event that ibm decides to increase the prices that it charges us  or reduces the amount of discounts or allowances we currently receive  and we are not able to pass along such increased costs charges to our customers  our business  financial condition and results of operations could be materially adversely affected 
in addition  pursuant to the ibm contract  we will pay fees to ibm based on the amount of our use of its network services subject to specified minimum payment amounts 
if our use of the network services declines  our gross margins will decrease  thereby also adversely affecting our business and operating results 
because we have no right to control the maintenance and operation of either the ibm van or bes it  we are subject to decisions that adversely affect the operation of the van and the bes it service and thus on our business and results of operations 
in addition  if ibm becomes unable or unwilling to provide or continue to support van or bes it services  we would either have to provide these services directly or arrange for another third party to provide such services 
we cannot assure you that we would be able to do so on a timely basis  if at all  or that the costs of any such arrangements would not materially adversely affect our business and results of operations 
disruption or unavailability of the ibm van or bes it service may have a material adverse effect on our business  results of operations and financial condition 

table of contents while we purchase network connectivity and electronic commerce related services from ibm  a portion of the purchased connectivity services are actually provided by at t  which purchased ibm s global network and corporate networking business in april ibm resells the at t global network to us 
ibm and at t are free to compete against us  and either of them may compete with us now or in the future
