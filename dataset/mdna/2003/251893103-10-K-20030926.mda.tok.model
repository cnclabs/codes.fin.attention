item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of the company s results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with the consolidated financial statements of the company and the notes thereto appearing elsewhere in this report 
in may  the company completed the acquisition of dominica management  inc  which owns and operates the ross university school of medicine and ross university school of veterinary medicine 
the amounts recorded at june  relating to the acquisition are subject to further adjustment based upon the final valuation of assets 
the company expects to complete this valuation and make any necessary adjustments in the first quarter of fiscal in addition  the amount recorded for the final purchase price is subject to adjustment based upon actual working capital at the closing date 
the company expects to make any necessary purchase price adjustments in the second quarter of fiscal deferred income taxes may also be affected by the final purchase price allocation 
fiscal year ended june  vs 
fiscal year ended june  total consolidated revenues for fiscal set a new record  increasing by million  or  from last year 
in may  the company completed the acquisition of dominica management  inc dmi for million 
dmi owns and operates the ross university school of medicine and the ross university school of veterinary medicine  operating in the caribbean countries of dominica and st 
kitts nevis  respectively 
ross university is one of the world s largest providers of medical and veterinary medical education with over  students 
ross university operations contributed million in revenues for the period from date of acquisition to the end of the fiscal year 
tuition revenues  which are the largest component of total revenues  increased by million  or  from last year 
tuition revenue is reported net of tuition refunds  as required by the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin entitled revenue recognition in financial statements and associated guidance 
compared to previous years  the lesser rate of increase in tuition revenue during fiscal was caused by reduced enrollments in the company s undergraduate technology programs 
other educational revenues increased by from last year 
other educational revenues is composed primarily of the sale of books and supplies  including the becker conviser cpa review course on cd rom and other cpa and cfa review study materials  application and other non refundable fees and interest or payment deferral charges on students outstanding accounts receivable balances 
the increased revenue results primarily from a higher enrollment fee charged to new students and increased sales of books and supplies for the cpa and cfa exam reviews as increased numbers of students enrolled in the company s exam preparation courses 
interest income on the company s short term investments of cash balances decreased by million from last year to million 
the decrease is due to lower interest rates available on investments and the application of some cash balances to offset bank service fees 
in addition  a portion of the company s cash balances in may and june were utilized to complete the acquisition of dmi 
the company s principal business is providing postsecondary education 
prior to the acquisition of dmi  the company had presented its financial results in two reportable segments  devry university undergraduate and graduate programs in business and technology and professional and training becker conviser cpa  cma  cfa exam reviews and corporate training 
with the may acquisition of dmi  the company for fiscal presents the financial results of these medical program operations in a third reportable segment 
devry university segment revenues increased by million  or  from last year 
contributing to the increased revenue was an almost increase in coursetakers in graduate management programs for the five terms of compared to the previous year 
however  partly offsetting this increase  total undergraduate enrollment for the three terms of decreased approximately from the previous year 
although undergraduate enrollments in business programs continue to increase  the company believes that declines in enrollment in its technology programs have been caused by reductions in technology field employment that has lessened applicant interest in these fields 
new undergraduate campus openings in philadelphia  pa  miramar  fl  and denver  co  plus an expanded number of devry university centers and increased online student enrollments helped reduce the effect of lower enrollment in the company s technology programs 
tuition rate increases of approximately also helped offset the effect of lower enrollments 
at the start of the summer term  which is the beginning of fiscal  graduate coursetakers increased from last year by to  however  total undergraduate enrollments of  remained below last year s level of  down 
this compares to a decline of in total undergraduate enrollments for the spring term  which was the last term of fiscal  compared to the spring term 
devry university entered into an agreement with follett higher education group follett several years ago to manage some of the undergraduate on campus bookstores and provide internet order capability to students at these campuses 
the wider range of ancillary merchandise and experienced retail store management available from follett are believed to provide an improved level of student service 
devry university receives a commission from follett based upon the level of bookstore sales at these campuses 
at fiscal year end  follett was managing campus bookstores  including two of the new campuses opened during the year 
sales at campus bookstores under follett management  net of commissions paid to devry university  were approximately million in fiscal compared to million in the previous year 
responsibility for managing additional campus bookstores may be transferred to follett in the future  based upon the needs of each campus 
in addition  sales of books to students enrolled in devry university online courses and some devry university centers are managed by a different company 
devry university also receives a commission based upon the level of these bookstore sales 
in the professional and training segment  revenues increased by million  or  from last year following a increase in revenues in the previous year 
increased numbers of students taking the becker conviser cpa review and stalla cfa review courses in the classroom  on cd rom or online  and an increased course price of approximately five percent all contributed to the increased revenue 
in fiscal  cost of educational services increased by million  or  from last year 
cost of educational services includes the cost of faculty and related staff  which represents approximately of the expense category 
more than half of the increase in this expense category was the result of higher wages and benefits to faculty and staff in all of the company s operations 
also included in this expense category are the costs of facilities  supplies  bookstore and other educational materials  student education related support activities and the provision for uncollectible accounts 
ross university expenses of a similar nature are included in this expense category for the six week period subsequent to its acquisition 
in the fourth quarter of  charges of approximately million related to workforce reductions in the company s eastern canada and us operations were included in this expense category as the company adjusted the size of its employee base to better match enrollments and revenues 
additions to long lived assets in devry university were million as the company continued its investment in new and expanded facilities and equipment for students and staff 
as a result of these and previous additions to facilities and equipment  depreciation expense in devry university  most of which is included in cost of educational services  increased by million  or  after increasing million  or  in the previous year 
contributing to the increased depreciation expense in fiscal was the recognition during the second quarter of an approximately million impairment loss on long lived leashold improvements in the company s canadian operations 
the recognition of this impairment loss followed an assessment of the expected future results and cash flows of the canadian operations where enrollment declines have adversely affected financial results 
student services and administrative expense increased by million  or  from last year 
student services and administrative expense includes the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs and expenses associated with curriculum development 
the increased spending primarily reflects higher advertising and selling costs associated with efforts to generate more new student enrollments in the company s educational programs for the terms that began in fiscal and for the summer term of fiscal ross university expenses of a similar nature are also included in this expense category for the six week period subsequent to its acquisition 
in addition  million of amortization expense of finite lived intangible assets related to the ross acquisition is included in this expense category 
in fiscal  the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards no 
 entitled goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets arising from a business combination are no longer amortized and charged to expense over time 
instead  as required by sfas  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles must be reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if circumstances arise indicating potential impairment 
as of june   the company  with the assistance of an independent professional valuation specialist  determined that there was no impairment loss in the reporting units represented by the company s three operating segments 
as previously explained  the company believes that reductions in technology field employment have lessened applicant interest in these fields  requiring the company to increase the level of its recruitment activity to maintain enrollments 
generally  expenditures for new student recruitment  which are charged to expense as incurred  precede the time periods in which revenue is generated by these new student enrollments 
the company believes that increased expenditures for new student recruitment were largely responsible for the increase in new undergraduate student enrollments  up from last year  in the summer term of fiscal included in student services and administrative expense was an approximately million charge to reflect the accrual for current year costs relating to employment agreements completed in the second quarter with the company s co chief executive officers 
this accrual is based on recording the present value of the company s obligation to the co chief executive officers over their period of future active service 
also  in response to the growing size and complexity of its educational programs  including the expanded number of devry university centers and online student enrollments  the company continued its design and development of a new student information system to better support the educational process and supporting activities 
information system development costs related to this project have increased from last year as the project nears implementation in fiscal in accordance with accounting principles for internal software development costs  certain wage and outside consulting service costs are being capitalized 
indirect expenses  such as training and employee communication  are charged directly to expense as incurred 
at the end of fiscal  costs capitalized to date were million  of which million was capitalized during the current fiscal year 
this compares to million capitalized during the previous year 
in addition to the amounts capitalized  million of related but indirect activity costs were charged directly to expense  up from million charged directly to expense in the previous year 
some elements of the overall system have already been placed into service 
amortization began in the fourth quarter of fiscal year over the expected useful lives of each program element  but not exceeding five years 
approximately million of amortization expense was recognized during the year 
one of the company s directors is also an investor and director of a consulting firm engaged by the company to assist with systems development projects  including the new student information system 
fees paid to this consulting firm have been negotiated to a level believed to be comparable to those charged to similar customers 
fees paid to this consulting firm during the current fiscal year were approximately million  compared to approximately million paid in fiscal the company estimates that fees to be paid to this consulting firm in fiscal will be reduced somewhat from the level incurred in as these system projects are being placed into service 
in the devry university segment  both operating income and operating margin as a percent of revenue declined from last year 
operating margins declined from last year to in the current year as operating income decreased by million from last year  due largely to the lower number of undergraduate enrollments and the higher level of spending on student recruitment to reverse the new and total student enrollment declines that occurred during the current year 
the operations of ross university were acquired by the company in may and their results of operations have been included in the company s results for the final six weeks of this year 
ross university operations for this period  net of amortization of intangible assets  interest expense on company borrowings for the acquisition and taxes on income as appropriate  were accretive to the overall company financial results 
in the professional and training segment  operating income increased by million  or  from last year 
operating margins increased from to as operating efficiencies were realized from increased numbers of students enrolled for the exam review courses and from higher tuition pricing 
interest expense increased by million as borrowings for the ross acquisition mid fourth quarter of the fiscal year generated additional expense 
taxes on income  before the non recurring benefit related to the company s canadian operations and described more fully below  were accrued at a rate of compared to last year 
contributing to this year s lower tax rate were certain business incentive tax credits 
also in february of the company restructured and continued its canadian subsidiary into the united states tax jurisdiction and domesticated it as a limited liability company generating current us tax benefits for the losses of the llc beginning in march 
the ross university school of medicine  operating in the commonwealth of dominica  and the ross university school of veterinary medicine  operating in the federation of st 
christopher nevis  st 
kitts  both have agreements with their respective governments that exempt them from local income taxation through the years and  respectively 
accordingly  no current provision for foreign income taxes was provided 
the company has also not recorded a tax provision for the undistributed earnings of the schools since the date of acquisition because it is the company s intention to indefinitely reinvest these earnings to service debt  improve and expand the facilities and operations of the schools and pursue future investment opportunities outside of the united states 
the company s future composite tax rate will reflect the combination of both an estimated tax liability at an approximately rate historically experienced on company operations other than ross university and no tax liability on the ross university operations in their home caribbean countries 
all of the amortization of intangible assets associated with the ross acquisition and the interest expense on the portion of the borrowings held by an offshore subsidiary  are attributable to the ross earnings that are exempt from income taxes and thus do not generate a tax benefit in any taxing jurisdiction 
during the second quarter  the company recorded approximately million of net non recurring tax benefits related to its canadian operations 
the company assessed the expected future results of its devry university canadian operations including future cash flows and taxable income 
this assessment included an analysis of the previously recorded canadian deferred tax assets 
these deferred tax assets consisted primarily of net operating loss carryforwards and a tax basis higher than book basis for property and equipment 
based upon this assessment  it was determined that a valuation allowance of percent was required for these deferred tax assets 
this resulted in an additional income tax expense provision of approximately million 
also during the second quarter  the company determined  based upon this same assessment  that it would deduct the full amount of the tax basis of its investment in its canadian subsidiary 
this reflects the negative value ascribed to the investment as determined by the independent valuations of the business that were undertaken as a part of the assessment 
the us income tax deduction results in a tax benefit totaling approximately million 
the net effect of these two actions associated with the canadian investment and operations is a net tax benefit of approximately million  categorized as non recurring tax benefits in the statement of income 
net income for the year of million decreased by million from the previous year 
earnings per share declined from per share diluted last year to per share diluted this year primarily as a result of the previously discussed lower undergraduate enrollments and increased spending on new student recruitment offset  in part  by the previously discussed net canadian tax benefit equal to approximately per share 
in august  the company announced that its subsidiary  devry canada llc  had signed a letter of intent with rcc college of technology rcc that will enable devry to phase out its operations at its toronto campus commencing with the term that begins in november subject to the company entering into a definitive agreement and approval by the ontario provincial ministry  devry university s toronto campus will no longer admit new students and will contract with rcc to manage the completion of programs of study for the current student body in toronto 
the letter of intent also makes provisions for the acquisition of certain devry assets and the use of certain portions of devry curriculum under the rcc brand name 
this agreement is expected to permit the company to reduce its operating losses at the toronto campus during the period of the agreement with rcc  ending with the elimination of the company s obligations and costs associated with the toronto operation by fiscal the company believes that losses incurred during each of the two years of the phase out should not exceed million pre tax  which is less than the loss experienced from operations in fiscal the actual amount and timing of these losses are dependent upon the terms of a final agreement between the company and rcc 
fiscal year ended june  vs 
fiscal year ended june  fiscal again set new records for financial performance 
total consolidated revenues increased by million  or  compared to tuition revenues  which are the largest component of total revenues  increased by million  or  from the previous fiscal year 
tuition revenue is reported net of tuition refunds  consistent with the securities and exchange commission s staff accounting bulletin entitled revenue recognition in financial statements and associated guidance 
other educational revenues is composed primarily of the sale of books and supplies  including the becker conviser cpa review course on cd rom and other cpa and cfa review study materials  and interest or payment deferral charges on students outstanding receivable balances 
other educational revenues increased by as the number of students enrolled in the company s educational programs that purchase such materials increased from the previous year 
the rate of increase in other educational revenues was less than the rate of increase in tuition revenues  in part  because of the continued outsourcing of devry university bookstore management  which is discussed more fully below 
interest income on the company s short term investments of cash balances decreased by million  or  from because of somewhat lower cash balances that were available for investment during the first half of the year as the company repaid borrowings under the revolving line for the purchase of two devry university campuses  lower interest rates available on investments and the application of cash balances to offset fees for bank services instead of short term investment 
the company s principal business is providing postsecondary education 
the company has presented its financial results in two reportable segments 
in february  the higher learning commission of the north central association approved the merger of devry institutes undergraduate programs and keller graduate school of management graduate programs into a single educational institution named devry university 
the north central association is one of six regional bodies that make up the nation s system for accrediting colleges and universities 
in support of the transition to devry university  the company s resources and organization have been restructured to better serve the needs of its students  employers of its graduates and shareholders 
accordingly  the reportable segments of the company have been realigned to reflect this combination and the prior year discussion of results of operations has been revised for consistency with the new structure 
devry university segment revenues increased by million  or  from last year 
revenue increases resulted from increased cumulative total student enrollment for the terms in the fiscal year in both the undergraduate and graduate programs 
at the start of the spring term  which spans a part of the third quarter and the fourth quarter of the fiscal year  there were  students enrolled in devry university undergraduate and graduate programs compared to  students in the spring term of the previous year 
although total devry university enrollments have continued to increase  undergraduate program offerings are heavily concentrated in the areas of computer and electronics technology 
interest in these programs as careers has been adversely affected by the news of employee layoffs and financial difficulty encountered by many firms in the technology sector of the economy 
as a result  new undergraduate student enrollments have declined from year ago levels by  and in the last three semesters  fall  spring and summer fiscal  respectively 
new undergraduate campus openings in federal way seattle  washington  and crystal city washington dc  virginia  and several new graduate school center openings during fiscal helped to reduce the effect of declining new students enrollments at previously opened campuses and contributed to the increased total student enrollment 
tuition rate increases of approximately also contributed to the increased revenues for the year 
at the start of the summer term  which is the first term in fiscal  total devry university enrollment was  compared to  in the previous summer 
devry university entered into an agreement with follett higher education group follett during fiscal to manage some of the undergraduate and graduate on campus bookstores and provide internet order capability to students at these campuses 
the wider range of ancillary merchandise and experienced retail store management available from follett is believed to provide an improved level of student service 
devry university receives a commission from follett based upon the level of bookstore sales at these campuses 
at fiscal year end  follett was managing campus bookstores  including those at the two new campuses opened during the year  compared to nine campus bookstores under follett management a year ago 
sales at campus bookstores under follett management  net of commissions paid to devry university  were approximately million and million  respectively  in fiscal and responsibility for managing additional campus bookstores may be transferred to follett in the future  based upon the needs of each campus 
in the professional and training segment  revenues increased by million  or 
increased numbers of students taking the becker conviser cpa review course in the classroom  on cd rom or online and expanded offerings of the stalla cfa review program plus tuition price increases contributed to the increased revenue 
in fiscal  cost of educational services increased by million  or 
cost of educational services includes the cost of faculty and related staff  which represents approximately of this expense category 
also included in this expense category are the costs of facilities  supplies  bookstore and other educational materials  student education related support activities and the provision for uncollectible student accounts 
additions to long lived assets in devry university were million  an increase of million from  as the company continued its investment in new and expanded facilities and equipment for students and staff 
included in the additions for fiscal was the purchase for approximately million  at the start of the year  of two undergraduate campuses formerly occupied under lease 
as a result of the additions to facilities and equipment  including the two new campuses and several graduate centers opened during the year  depreciation expense in devry university  most of which is included in cost of educational services  increased by million  or 
student services and administrative expense increased by million  or  from the previous year 
student services and administrative expense includes the costs of new student recruiting  general and administrative costs and expenses associated with curriculum development 
the increased spending reflects marketing costs associated with generating higher student enrollments in the company s educational programs for the terms that began in fiscal and for the summer term of fiscal  which began in july 
generally  expenditures for new student recruitment precede the time periods in which there is revenue generated by these new student enrollments 
during the year  to counter declining response rates to advertising for the undergraduate technology programs  advertising expenses were increased beyond those originally planned and beyond the historical rate of increase in this expense category 
offsetting some of the advertising expense increase were savings in selling expense as sales representatives in some remote area sales territories were eliminated to better match the costs with revenues generated in these territories 
also  in response to the growing size and complexity of its educational program offerings  the company continued its design and development of a new student information system to better support the educational process and supporting activities 
information system development costs related to this project  and to other system support and improvement initiatives  have increased from last year 
in accordance with accounting principles for internal software development costs  certain wage and outside consulting service costs are being capitalized 
indirect expenses related to the project  such as training and employee communications  are charged to expense as incurred 
at the end of june  total capitalized costs were million  of which million was capitalized in fiscal year in addition to the amounts capitalized  million of related but indirect activity was charged directly to expense during the year 
during the fourth quarter of the year  two elements of the overall system design were put into service and amortization was initiated over the expected useful lives  not exceeding five years 
in the fourth quarter  a total of million of previously capitalized student system development costs were charged to amortization expense 
one of the company s directors is also an investor and director of a consulting firm engaged by the company to assist with systems development projects  including the new student information system 
fees paid to this consulting firm during fiscal year totaled million 
fees paid to this consulting firm have been negotiated to a level believed to be comparable to those charged to similar customers 
the company estimates that fees paid to this consulting firm in the coming year will be reduced somewhat from the level incurred in fiscal as these systems projects near completion 
partly offsetting the increased student recruitment expenses and information system development costs during the year was a reduction of million in amortization expense of intangible assets and goodwill compared to the same period a year ago as a result of the company s adoption of statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 entitled goodwill and other intangible assets 
goodwill and indefinite lived intangible assets arising from a business combination are no longer amortized and charged to expense over time 
instead  goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles must be reviewed annually for impairment  or more frequently if circumstances arise indicating potential impairment 
for goodwill  if the carrying amount of the reporting unit containing the goodwill exceeds the fair value of that reporting unit  an impairment loss is recognized to the extent the implied fair value of the reporting unit s goodwill is less than the carrying amount of the goodwill 
for indefinite lived intangible assets  if the carrying amount exceeds the fair value  an impairment loss shall be recognized in an amount equal to that excess 
as of june   there was no impairment loss associated with the company s indefinite lived intangible assets or goodwill associated with the reporting units represented by the company s two operating segments 
in the devry university segment  although the amount of operating income increased from last year by  operating margin as a percent of revenues declined from last year to in the current year 
the increased level of spending on student recruitment  increased spending on information systems design and the opening of two new undergraduate campuses and several graduate school centers all contributed to the lower operating margin 
in the professional and training segment  operating margin increased from in to in the current year 
operating efficiencies from increased enrollments and higher tuition pricing all contributed to the higher operating margin 
the company s earnings from operations in fiscal before interest expense and taxes were a record million  increasing by from fiscal operating margin  which has increased during each of the past several years  increased again from in the previous year to in contributing to the increased margin was the adoption  at the start of the fiscal year  of sfas relating to the amortization of goodwill and intangible assets  which reduced amortization expense from the previous year by approximately million 
operating margin was also improved by the continued outsourcing of low margin bookstore sales and operating economies from increased student enrollments 
interest expense increased to million in as the company borrowed money at the start of the fiscal year under its revolving loan agreement to acquire two undergraduate campuses formerly occupied under lease 
the borrowings  which occurred in july  were not fully repaid until april 
taxes on income were incurred at a rate of of pre tax income for the year  compared to in the previous year 
the tax rate for was affected by changes to future tax rates in canada that reduced the carrying value of the company s net deferred tax assets in canada and increased tax expense for the year 
net income of million  or per share diluted  was a record for any year 
this compares to net income of million  or per share diluted in  which included per share of goodwill and intangible asset amortization that was discontinued in with the adoption of sfas application of critical accounting policies note of the notes to consolidated financial statements for the fiscal year ended june   describes in detail the method of application of the critical accounting policies listed below 
devry university tuition and technology fees and ross university tuition revenues are recognized ratably on a straight line basis over the applicable academic term 
advertising costs are charged to expense in the period in which materials are purchased or services are rendered 
similarly  all start up expenses related to new operating locations and new curriculum development costs are also charged directly to expense as incurred 
the costs associated with developing the company s new student information system are being capitalized in accordance with the rules on accounting for costs of computer software developed for internal use 
fixed asset depreciation is computed on a straight line basis over the estimated useful life of the asset 
stock based compensation is accounted for using the intrinsic value approach of apb and all required disclosures relative to such compensation and its pro forma effect on earnings are disclosed in the footnotes to the financial statements 
inventory is valued using the first in  first out method of accounting 
in accordance with sfas entitled goodwill and other intangible assets  the company undertakes periodic assessments of the fair value of its reporting units compared to their carrying value for potential impairment of goodwill and of the fair value compared to carrying value of intangible assets arising from a business combination 
this assessment is performed annually  or more frequently if circumstances require  with the assistance of an independent professional valuation specialist 
the valuation is based upon estimates of future earnings and cash flow for several years into the future and includes other assumptions including income tax and interest discount rates 
such estimates require significant judgment and over the period of future years  actual results may differ from these estimates 
although management believes that its estimates are conservative  decreases in earnings and cash flow from these estimates and or significant changes in other assumptions underlying the analysis could result in impairment charges in future periods 
at june  intangible assets from business combinations equaled million and goodwill equaled million 
together these assets equal almost of total assets and any impairment could significantly affect future results of operation 
the company s financial statements include estimates and assumptions about the reported amounts of assets  liabilities  revenues and expenses whose exact amounts will not be known until future periods 
actual amounts may differ from the estimates included in the financial statements 
significant estimates included in the company s financial statements include the method of revenue recognition across the academic periods  determining the useful lives of equipment and facilities whose value is a significant portion of the company s total assets  determining the value and useful lives of acquired finite lived intangible assets  determining the value of indefinite lived intangible assets  determining the pattern of the amortization of finite lived intangible assets over their economic life  estimating losses to be realized in the future on the collection of presently owed student receivable balances  estimating costs associated with any settlement of law suits in which the company is a defendant and estimating health care reimbursement claims for medical services rendered but not yet processed or paid 
the methodology by which each of these estimates has been determined for fiscal is consistent with the manner in which such estimates were made in prior years although the parameters used in setting the value of these estimates is analyzed and may change as current conditions warrant 
variances from estimate to actual expense for these items in past years have not been material 
although different assumptions about the parameters affecting each of these estimates could produce a different amount of estimate  the reasonably determined range of estimates for each item would generally not be large enough to materially change the overall company reported financial results 
contingencies the company is subject to occasional lawsuits  investigations and claims arising in the normal conduct of its business 
in march  the company received notice of a class action complaint filed under the fair labor standards act by several former field sales representatives seeking overtime compensation for services rendered during their period of employment 
in march  the company participated in a required mediation session but no resolution was reached 
in january  the company received notice of an antitrust complaint concerning the alleged monopoly by operations of its becker cpa review corp 
subsidiary in california 
this complaint was filed in federal district court by the trustee in bankruptcy of a failed cpa review provider seeking a substantial amount of damages 
in april  this complaint was voluntarily dismissed by the plaintiff without prejudice 
the complaint was amended and has subsequently been re filed 
in january  a graduate of one of devry university s los angeles area campuses filed a class action complaint on behalf of all students enrolled in the post baccalaureate degree program in information technology 
the suit alleges that the program offered by devry did not conform to the program as it was presented in the advertising and other marketing materials 
in march  the complaint was dismissed by the court with limited right to amend and re file 
the complaint was subsequently amended and re filed 
in november  three graduates of one of devry university s chicago area campuses filed a class action complaint that alleges devry graduates do not have appropriate skills for employability in the computer information systems field 
the complaint was subsequently dismissed by the court  but was amended and re filed  this time including a current student from a second chicago area campus 
the company has recorded approximately million associated with estimated loss contingencies at june  while the ultimate outcome of these contingencies is difficult to estimate at this time  the company does intend to vigorously defend itself with respect to these claims 
liquidity and capital resources the company s primary source of liquidity is the cash received from payments for student tuition  books and fees 
these payments include funds originating as student and family educational loans  other financial aid from various federal  state and provincial loan and grant programs  and student and family financial resources 
the pattern of cash receipts during the year is somewhat cyclical 
the level of accounts receivable from which payments are collected reaches a peak immediately after the billing of tuition  books and fees each semester 
at devry university  the undergraduate semesters begin in july  november and march 
collections of these receivables reach their peak during the first two months of each term  generally reaching of all collections for the term 
collections during this period exceed payments for operating expenses applicable to that period and generally provide sufficient cash flow for the balance of the semester s operations when collections are lower 
accounts receivable reach their lowest level just prior to the start of the next semester  dropping to their lowest point in the year at the end of june 
the end of june corresponds to both the end of the undergraduate spring semester and the end of a financial aid year  at which time substantially all financial aid for the previous months has been disbursed to students accounts 
ross university experiences a similar operating pattern for its semesters that begin in may  september and january 
in fiscal  the graduate operations of devry university had five term starts per year  but adoption of a uniform academic calendar created a revised term structure with six term starts per year that was implemented in july  effective with the start of fiscal cash flow from the increase in the number of term starts is expected to increase to the extent that some current students will enroll in the full six terms per year to complete their academic program more quickly rather than continue to proceed at the previous pace of five terms per year 
most of the professional and training segment operation had two term starts per year  but the change to an on demand cpa exam format beginning in april will create a new cash flow pattern that is expected to be somewhat smoother throughout the year than had been previously experienced 
although these term start dates and frequency may be different from the devry undergraduate operations  there are similar cyclical patterns in cash receipts within the period of these respective academic term cycles 
at june   total company accounts receivable  net of related reserves  were approximately million  compared to million last year 
although increased company revenues  including revenues from ross university  created higher receivables to be collected  collection performance and financial aid administration at devry university improved again during the year and helped reduce the level of receivables at fiscal year end  excluding the accounts receivable acquired with ross university 
reserves for uncollectible accounts for both undergraduate and graduate student receivables were increased as a percentage of outstanding receivables to reflect the company s current collection experience on balances owed 
to help further reduce the level of company provided interim student financing under the devry university undergraduate educard program  students at some of the us and canadian devry institutes participate in supplementary loan programs funded by private lenders 
the supplementary loans are aimed at students whose eligibility for federal and state funded financial aid is not sufficient to cover all their costs of education 
these loans are subject to a limited company default risk sharing agreement 
at june  the company had fully recognized as expense  the full amount of its share of the default risk 
the company is highly dependent upon the timely receipt of financial aid funds at devry university and ross university 
the company estimates that historically  approximately of its devry university undergraduate students tuition  book and fee revenues were financed by government provided financial aid to students 
keller graduate school collections from student participation in federal loan programs represent more than of keller revenues 
ross university collections from student participation in federal loan programs represents between and of its revenues 
the financial aid and assistance programs in which the company s students participate are subject to political and governmental budgetary considerations 
there is no assurance that such funding will be maintained in the future 
extensive and complex regulations in the united states and canada govern all of the government financial assistance programs in which the company s students participate 
the company s administration of these programs is periodically reviewed by various regulatory agencies 
any regulatory violation could be the basis for disciplinary action  including initiation of a suspension  limitation or termination proceeding against the company 
such program reviews may be conducted at any educational institution at any time and have been conducted in the past at several company campuses 
previous department of education program reviews have not resulted in material findings or adjustments 
in conjunction with the required annual review procedures related to its administration of financial aid programs under the ontario student aid program  the toronto area devry campuses had engaged in discussions with the ontario ministry of education relating to certain additional information requirements 
these additional information requirements could serve as the basis for a ministry claim for the return of some amounts of financial aid disbursed to students attending these campuses 
although there are no current discussions underway with the ministry  based upon its previous discussions  the company believes that there will be no significant monetary liability 
under the terms of the company s participation in governmental financial aid programs  certain cash received from various state governments and the us department of education is maintained in restricted bank accounts 
these funds are either received subsequent to the completion of the authorization and disbursement process for the benefit of the student or just prior to that authorization 
once the authorization and disbursement process to the student has been completed  the funds are transferred to unrestricted accounts and these funds then become available for use by the company in current operations 
this process generally occurs within the period of the academic term for which such funds were authorized  with no academic term being more than weeks in length 
at june   cash in the amount of million was held in restricted bank accounts 
at june   cash in restricted bank accounts equaled million 
cash generated from operations in fiscal was million  compared to million last year 
contributing to the decrease in cash flow from operations were the change in academic calendar for devry university s graduate school and the inclusion of ross university operations in this year s results 
the change in the graduate program academic calendar caused the term that has historically begun in june to be rescheduled to begin in july 
therefore  the usual large cash inflow that accompanies the start of each new term was deferred from the end of fiscal into fiscal the acquisition of ross university occurred in mid may  subsequent to the start of an academic term that began at the start of the month 
therefore  the large cash inflow that accompanies each term start occurred prior to the acquisition 
the following period  which is generally a period of negative cash flow  was the period that was included in the company s consolidated statement of cash flows 
capital expenditures in fiscal were million compared to the record investment of million in the previous year 
in just the past three years  the company has invested over million for expansion  facility improvement and replacement of school laboratories  and teaching and administrative equipment for its educational offerings 
for fiscal  capital expenditures are expected to be at approximately the same level or slightly higher than in fiscal the new devry university campus opening in houston  tx  in fiscal is being financed by the company but was partially completed during fiscal other new operating locations are expected to be in leased facilities and  therefore  require less capital spending by the company 
capital spending on improvements  including instructional technology and expansion is an integral component of the company s operating strategy 
in may  in conjunction with its acquisition of ross university  the company terminated its existing million revolving loan agreement and entered into two new loan agreements 
these loan agreements provided funding for the acquisition and for working capital needs as may be required 
under these new agreements  all borrowings and letters of credit issued under these agreements are through devry inc and global education international  gei which is a newly formed international subsidiary 
the two new loan agreements and their borrowing limits are as follows revolving credit agreement devry inc as borrower  gei as borrower  total  senior notes devry inc as borrower  gei as borrower  total  all borrowings and letters of credit under the revolving credit facility mature on july  it is the company s intention to request extensions of this agreement prior to its maturity 
at june   aggregate borrowings under these agreements totaled million  consisting of borrowings of million under the revolving credit agreement and borrowings of million under the senior notes 
based upon these levels of borrowing at fiscal year end  a increase in short term interest rates would result in million of additional annual interest expense 
also  at fiscal year end  letters of credit issued under the revolving credit agreement totaled approximately million 
approximately million of these letters of credit were issued in conjunction with devry university s participation in student financial aid programs 
most of these letters of credit have expiration dates of less than one year 
to date  no amount has ever been drawn under any letter of credit issued on behalf of the company 
under the terms of the revolving credit agreement  by june   borrowings  which were million at june   may not exceed million but there are no other required repayments until the maturity date 
there are no required repayments under the terms of the senior note agreements until their maturity in prepayments during the first two years of the senior note agreements include a prepayment penalty 
the company does not intend to prepay any amount of the senior notes during the prepayment penalty period 
borrowings under the revolving credit agreement bear interest at either the prime rate or a eurodollar libor rate plus a rate of to depending upon the achievement of certain financial ratios 
at june   the additional interest rate was 
borrowings under the senior note agreement bear interest at a eurodollar libor rate plus 
both agreements include financial and other covenants similar to those typically found in other loan agreements and which are not expected to hinder the company s plans for future operation 
subsequent to june   the company repaid million of its borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
also  subsequent to june   the company entered into several interest rate cap agreements to protect approximately one third of its current borrowings from sharp increases in short term interest rates upon which its borrowings are based 
these interest rate cap agreements protect the portion of the company s debt which is covered by these agreements from increases in short term interest rates above 
the company intends to periodically evaluate the need for interest rate protection in light of projected changes in interest rates and borrowing levels 
the company s only long term contractual obligations consist of its revolving line of credit and senior notes  operating leases on facilities and equipment and agreements for various services 
at june   the only required payments under its borrowings agreements prior to their maturity was million required to be repaid by june  to achieve the lower level of permitted borrowings under the revolving credit agreement 
required payments under non cancelable operating leases with a term in excess of one year are million and million for fiscal and  respectively 
the company is not a party to any off balance sheet financing or contingent payment arrangements nor are there any unconsolidated subsidiaries of the company 
there are no loans extended to any officer  director or other person affiliated with the company 
the company has not entered into any synthetic leases and there are no residual purchase or value commitments related to any facility lease 
the company has not entered into any derivative  swap  futures contract  put  call  hedge or non exchange traded contract except for the interest rate cap agreements noted above 
under the terms of these agreements the company is not obligated to any further payment liability beyond their original purchase price 
the company has posted more than million of surety bonds to various governmental jurisdictions on behalf of devry university in the united states and approximately cdn million in canada related primarily to its student recruiting and educational operations in those jurisdictions 
in addition  the company has posted million in surety bonds on behalf of becker conviser professional review as of the end of fiscal if the company were to fail to meet its obligations in these jurisdictions  it could be responsible for payment up to the amount of the bond issued to that jurisdiction 
to date  no surety bond has ever been paid in connection with the company failing to meet its obligations 
a summary of the company s contractual obligations is presented below dollars in thousands due in less than after total year years years years long term debt     operating leases      other long term obligations total cash obligations      the company believes that current balances of unrestricted cash  cash generated from operations and  if necessary  the revolving loan facility will be sufficient to fund both its current operations and its current growth plans for the foreseeable future unless future investment opportunities should arise similar to the recent acquisition of ross university

the canadian subsidiary does not have any material long term contracts to purchase or sell goods and services  other than lease agreements on its teaching facilities  and the company does not have any foreign exchange contracts or derivative financial instruments related to protection from changes in the value of the canadian dollar
