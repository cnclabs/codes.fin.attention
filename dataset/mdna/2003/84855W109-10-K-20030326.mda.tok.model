proved reserves of bcfe  reserve replacement was of production in spinnaker s results of operations and financial position were significantly impacted by lower commodity prices and production in of the million net decrease in revenues  million was due to a lower average commodity price on an equivalent basis and million related to decreased production  offset in part by an increase in net hedging income of million 
the company had million in cash and cash equivalents and no debt at december  risk factors in addition to the other information set forth elsewhere in this annual report  the following factors should be carefully considered when evaluating spinnaker 
exploration is a high risk activity  and the d seismic data and other advanced technologies the company uses cannot eliminate exploration risk and require experienced technical personnel whom the company may be unable to attract or retain 
the company s future success will depend on the success of its exploratory drilling program 
exploration activities involve numerous risks  including the risk that no commercially productive natural gas or oil reservoirs will be discovered 
in addition  the company often is uncertain as to the future cost or timing of drilling  completing and producing wells 
furthermore  drilling operations may be curtailed  delayed or canceled as a result of the additional exploration time and expense associated with a variety of factors  including unexpected drilling conditions  pressure or irregularities in formations  equipment failures or accidents  adverse weather conditions  compliance with governmental requirements and shortages or delays in the availability of drilling rigs or equipment 
even when used and properly interpreted  d seismic data and visualization techniques only assist geoscientists in identifying subsurface structures and hydrocarbon indicators 
they do not allow the interpreter to know conclusively if hydrocarbons are present or economically producible 
the company could incur losses as a result of expenditures on unsuccessful wells 
poor results from exploration activities could materially and adversely affect future cash flows and results of operations 
the company s exploratory drilling success will depend  in part  on its ability to attract and retain experienced explorationists and other professional personnel 
competition for explorationists and engineers with experience in the gulf of mexico is extremely intense 
if the company cannot retain its current personnel or attract additional experienced personnel  its ability to compete in the gulf of mexico could be adversely affected 
a substantial portion of spinnaker s proved reserves are associated with its deepwater oil discovery at front runner 
the development of front runner will require significant financial resources before initial production and remains subject to other uncertainties that could have a material impact on the development of this discovery 
spinnaker s deepwater oil discovery at front runner  in which the company has a non operator working interest  has required and will continue to require significant financial resources in advance of the expected initial production date in the summer of the company has incurred million in capital expenditures for front runner through december  and expects to incur an aggregate of approximately million in future development costs during and because another oil and gas exploration and production company operates front runner  the company has a limited ability to influence the operations and costs associated with this property 
front runner is located in approximately  feet of water and wells have been drilled in the front runner area to total depths in excess of  feet 
the company has limited experience with large deepwater and deep drilling depth discoveries similar to front runner as most of its prior discoveries have occurred in shallower waters and at shallower drilling depths 
as a result of these uncertainties and risks  the company may encounter difficulties and delays that could cause actual expenditures to exceed anticipated amounts 
j 
ray mcdermott inc mcdermott  the contractor responsible for construction  delivery and installation of the front runner spar production facility  has announced that it is experiencing liquidity concerns 
if mcdermott experiences additional significant unanticipated costs in the future  it may be unable to fund all of its anticipated operating and capital needs  which may delay the expected delivery date of the spar production facility as well as the initial production date and actual expenditures may exceed anticipated amounts 
the hull of the spar production facility is being constructed in dubai  uae due to the current military conflict in the middle east  the delivery date of the hull to the gulf of mexico may be delayed 
additionally  weather and other conditions may delay the installation of the spar production facility on location 
any delays in the delivery or installation dates would cause a delay in the initial production date 
front runner accounted for more than of spinnaker s proved undeveloped reserves at december  if the actual reserves associated with front runner are substantially less than the estimated reserves  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
when production ultimately commences for this discovery  it may produce substantially less oil and natural gas than currently projected 
additionally  the company cannot predict commodity prices when production commences 
if production is substantially less than currently projected or commodity prices are low  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
these uncertainties and other risks described in this risk factors section and elsewhere in this annual report make it difficult to predict whether front runner can be successfully or economically developed 
if front runner cannot be successfully and economically developed  the company s future business  financial condition and operating results will be materially and adversely affected 
the natural gas and oil business involves many operating risks that can cause substantial losses 
the natural gas and oil business involves a variety of operating risks  including fires  explosions  blow outs and surface cratering  uncontrollable flows of underground natural gas  oil and formation water  natural disasters  pipe or cement failures  casing collapses  embedded oilfield drilling and service tools  abnormally pressured formations and environmental hazards such as natural gas leaks  oil spills  pipeline ruptures and discharges of toxic gases 
if any of these events occur  the company could incur substantial losses as a result of injury or loss of life  severe damage to and destruction of property  natural resources and equipment  pollution and other environmental damage  clean up responsibilities  regulatory investigation and penalties  suspension of the company s operations and repairs to resume operations 
if the company experiences any of these problems  it could affect well bores  platforms  gathering systems and processing facilities  which could adversely affect its ability to conduct operations 
offshore operations are also subject to a variety of operating risks specific to the marine environment  such as capsizing  collisions and damage or loss from hurricanes or other adverse weather conditions 
these conditions can cause substantial damage to facilities and interrupt production 
as a result  the company could incur substantial liabilities that could reduce or eliminate the funds available for exploration  development or leasehold acquisitions  or result in loss of equipment and properties 
for some risks  the company may not obtain insurance if it believes the cost of available insurance is excessive relative to the risks presented 
in addition  pollution and environmental risks generally are not fully insurable 
if a significant accident or other event occurs and is not fully covered by insurance  it could adversely affect the company s operations 
exploration for natural gas and oil at deeper drilling depths and in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico involves greater operational and financial risks than exploration at shallower depths and in shallower waters 
these risks could result in substantial losses 
the company explores for natural gas and oil at deeper drilling depths and in the deep waters of the gulf of mexico where operations are more difficult and costly than at shallower depths and in shallower waters 
deep depth and deepwater drilling and operations require the application of recently developed technologies that involve a higher risk of mechanical failure 
the company has experienced and will continue to experience significantly higher drilling costs for its deep depth and deepwater prospects 
at december   approximately of the company s proved undeveloped reserves were located in deep water 
the deep water lacks the physical and oilfield service infrastructure present in the shallower waters 
as a result  deepwater projects require long term commitments of significant financial resources 
deepwater operations may also require a significant amount of time between the discovery date and the initial production date when the company can market the natural gas or oil  increasing both the financial and operational risk involved with these operations 
the company is vulnerable to operational  regulatory and other risks associated with the gulf of mexico because it currently explores and produces exclusively in that area 
the company s operations and revenues are impacted acutely by conditions in the gulf of mexico because it currently explores and produces exclusively in that area 
this concentration of activity makes the company more vulnerable than many of its competitors to the risks associated with the gulf of mexico  including delays and increased costs relating to adverse weather conditions  drilling rig and other oilfield services and compliance with environmental and other laws and regulations 
a significant part of the value of the company s production and reserves is concentrated in a small number of offshore properties 
because of this concentration  any production problems or inaccuracies in reserve estimates related to those properties are more likely to adversely impact the company s business 
during  approximately of the company s production came from three of its properties in the gulf of mexico 
if mechanical problems  storms or other events curtailed a substantial portion of this production  the company s cash flow would be adversely affected 
in addition  at december   the company s proved reserves were located on different blocks in the gulf of mexico  with approximately of the proved reserves attributable to six of these properties 
one property  front runner  accounted for more than of total proved undeveloped reserves and more than of total proved reserves 
if the actual reserves associated with any one of these six properties are substantially less than the estimated reserves  the company s results of operations and financial condition could be adversely affected 
the commission is currently reviewing information from spinnaker and other oil and gas companies operating in the gulf of mexico to assess how the industry is determining proved reserves related to new discoveries 
rules and regulations of the commission allow companies to recognize proved reserves if economic producibility is supported by either actual production or a conclusive formation test 
the commission believes that a production flow test of reserves satisfies the requirements of a conclusive formation test 
in the absence of a production flow test  compelling technical data must exist to recognize proved reserves 
the industry has increasingly depended on advanced technical testing to support economic producibility 
spinnaker has recorded most of its proved reserves in deep water based on various advanced technical tests rather than production flow tests 
the company expects initial production from the majority of its proved undeveloped reserves in deep water to commence no later than the summer of the company believes these proved reserves are properly recorded and classified 
spinnaker has furnished the information requested by the commission and is unable to predict the outcome of the commission s review of spinnaker s and the industry s practices 
if any seismic contractor terminates its data agreement with spinnaker  the company s ability to find additional reserves could be impaired 
the company s success depends heavily on its access to d seismic data 
if any seismic contractor terminates its data agreement with spinnaker  the company would lose access to a portion of its d seismic data  which loss could have an adverse effect on its ability to find additional reserves 
a seismic contractor may terminate its data agreement with spinnaker on several grounds  including if a competitor of the seismic contractor acquires control of spinnaker or if the company breaches the data agreement with that seismic contractor  subject to certain exceptions 
see item business seismic data agreements termination events for a description of these exceptions 
competitors may use superior technology which the company may be unable to afford or which would require costly investments in order to compete 
the industry is subject to rapid and significant advancements in technology  including the introduction of new products and services using new technologies 
as competitors use or develop new technologies  the company may be placed at a competitive disadvantage  and competitive pressures may force it to implement new technologies at a substantial cost 
in addition  competitors may have greater financial  technical and personnel resources that allow them to enjoy technological advantages and may in the future allow them to implement new technologies before the company can 
the company cannot be certain that it will be able to implement technologies on a timely basis or at a cost that is acceptable to it 
one or more of the technologies that the company currently uses or that it may implement in the future may become obsolete  which may adversely affect the company s results of operations and financial condition 
for example  marine seismic acquisition technology has undergone rapid technological advancements in recent years and further significant technological developments could substantially impair the value of spinnaker s d seismic data 
reserve estimates depend on many assumptions that may turn out to be inaccurate 
any material inaccuracies in these reserve estimates or their underlying assumptions will materially affect the quantities and net present value of the company s reserves 
the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex 
it requires interpretations of available technical data and various assumptions  including assumptions relating to economic factors 
any significant inaccuracies in these interpretations or assumptions could materially affect the estimated quantities and net present value of reserves 
see item properties natural gas and oil reserves 
in order to prepare these estimates  the company must project production rates and the timing of development expenditures 
the company must also analyze available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data  and the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
the process also requires economic assumptions such as natural gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and the availability of funds 
therefore  estimates of natural gas and oil reserves are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  natural gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from the company s estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and net present value of reserves 
in addition  the company may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
moreover  some of the producing wells included in the reserve report had produced for only a relatively short period of time as of december  because most of the reserve estimates are not based on a lengthy production history and are calculated using volumetric analysis  these estimates are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history 
it should not be assumed that the present value of future net cash flows from the company s proved reserves is the current market value of its estimated natural gas and oil reserves 
in accordance with commission requirements  the company bases the estimated discounted future net cash flows from its proved reserves on prices and costs on the date of the estimate 
actual future prices and costs may differ materially from those used in the net present value estimate 
the failure to replace reserves would adversely affect production and cash flows 
the company s future natural gas and oil production depends on its success in finding or acquiring additional reserves 
if the company fails to replace reserves  its level of production and cash flows would be adversely impacted 
in general  production from natural gas and oil properties declines as reserves are depleted  with the rate of decline depending on reservoir characteristics and mechanical issues 
the company s total proved reserves decline as reserves are produced unless it conducts other successful exploration and development activities or acquires properties containing proved reserves  or both 
the company s ability to make the necessary capital investment to maintain or expand its asset base of natural gas and oil reserves would be impaired to the extent cash flow from operations is reduced and external sources of capital become limited or unavailable 
the company may not be successful in exploring for  developing or acquiring additional reserves 
if the company is not successful  its future production and revenues will be adversely affected 
relatively short production periods for gulf of mexico properties subject the company to higher reserve replacement needs  require the company to incur capital expenditures more frequently to replace production and may impair its ability to slow or shut in production during periods of low prices for natural gas and oil 
reservoirs in the gulf of mexico are generally sandstone reservoirs characterized by high porosity  permeability  pressure and temperature 
production of these reservoirs is generally constant for a relatively shorter period of time with a rapid decline in production at the end of the reservoir life compared to production of reservoirs in many other producing regions of the world 
as a result  reserve replacement needs from new prospects in the gulf of mexico are greater and require the company to incur capital expenditures more frequently to replace production than would typically be required in many other producing regions of the world 
the company expects a decline in production during the first quarter of due to the rapid production decline of certain producing wells and a shut in for pipeline repairs 
also  revenues and return on capital will depend significantly on prices prevailing during these relatively short production periods 
the company s potential need to generate revenues to fund ongoing capital commitments or reduce future indebtedness may limit its ability to slow or shut in production from producing wells in the future during periods of low prices for natural gas and oil 
natural gas and oil prices fluctuate widely  and low prices could have a material adverse impact on the company s business and financial results 
the company s revenues  profitability and future growth depend substantially on prevailing prices for natural gas and oil 
prices also affect the amount of cash flow available for capital expenditures and the company s ability to borrow and raise additional capital 
the amount the company can borrow under the credit facility is subject to periodic re determination based in part on changing expectations of future prices 
lower prices may also reduce the amount of natural gas and oil that the company can economically produce 
prices for natural gas and oil fluctuate widely 
among the factors that can cause this fluctuation are the level of consumer product demand  weather conditions  domestic and foreign governmental regulations  the price and availability of alternative fuels  political conditions in natural gas and oil producing regions  the domestic and foreign supply of natural gas and oil  the price of foreign imports and overall economic conditions 
if natural gas and oil prices decline  even if for only a short period of time  it is possible that write downs of natural gas and oil properties could occur in the future 
hedging production has limited and may continue to limit potential gains from increases in commodity prices or result in losses 
the company enters into hedging arrangements from time to time to reduce its exposure to fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices and to achieve more predictable cash flow 
these financial arrangements take the form of swap contracts or cashless collars and are placed with major trading counterparties the company believes represent minimum credit risks 
the company cannot provide assurance that these trading counterparties will not become credit risks in the future 
hedging arrangements expose the company to risks in some circumstances  including situations when the other party to the hedging contract defaults on its contract obligations or there is a change in the expected differential between the underlying price in the hedging agreement and actual prices received 
these hedging arrangements have limited and may continue to limit the benefit the company could receive from increases in the prices for natural gas and oil 
the company cannot provide assurance that the hedging transactions it has entered into  or will enter into  will adequately protect it from fluctuations in natural gas and oil prices 
the company may choose not to engage in hedging transactions in the future 
as a result  the company may be adversely affected during periods of declining natural gas and oil prices 
natural gas prices have fluctuated widely in early the company will recognize net hedging losses of million in the first quarter of based on natural gas price settlements 
if natural gas prices remain at current levels  spinnaker will incur significant hedging losses in the remainder of the company s success depends on its chief executive officer and other key personnel  the loss of whom could disrupt business operations 
the company depends to a large extent on the efforts and continued employment of the company s president and chief executive officer  roger l 
jarvis  and other key personnel  including the company s vice president exploration who will retire in early if mr 
jarvis or other key personnel resign or become unable to continue in their present role and if they are not adequately replaced  the company s business operations could be adversely affected 
the company is subject to complex laws and regulations  including environmental regulations  that can adversely affect the cost  manner or feasibility of doing business 
exploration for and development  production and sale of natural gas and oil in the us and especially in the gulf of mexico are subject to extensive federal  state and local laws and regulations  including environmental laws and regulations 
the company may be required to make large expenditures to comply with environmental and other governmental regulations 
matters subject to regulation include discharge permits for drilling operations  drilling bonds  reports concerning operations and taxation 
under these laws and regulations  the company could be liable for personal injuries  property damage  oil spills  discharge of hazardous materials  remediation and clean up costs and other environmental damages 
the company does not believe that full insurance coverage for all potential environmental damages is available at a reasonable cost 
failure to comply with these laws and regulations also may result in the suspension or termination of its operations and subject the company to administrative  civil and criminal penalties 
moreover  these laws and regulations could change in ways that substantially increase costs 
for example  congress or the mms could decide to limit exploratory drilling or natural gas production in additional areas of the gulf of mexico 
accordingly  any of these liabilities  penalties  suspensions  terminations or regulatory changes could materially and adversely affect the company s financial condition and results of operations 
competition in the industry is intense  and the company is smaller and has a more limited operating history than most of its competitors in the gulf of mexico 
the company competes with major and independent natural gas and oil companies for property acquisitions 
it also competes for the equipment and labor required to operate and develop properties 
most of the competitors have substantially greater financial and other resources than the company 
as a result  in the deep water where exploration is more expensive  competitors may be better able to withstand sustained periods of unsuccessful drilling 
in addition  larger competitors may be able to absorb the burden of any changes in federal  state and local laws and regulations more easily than the company can  which would adversely affect its competitive position 
these competitors may be able to pay more for exploratory prospects and productive natural gas and oil properties and may be able to define  evaluate  bid for and purchase a greater number of properties and prospects than the company can 
the company s ability to explore for natural gas and oil prospects and to acquire additional properties in the future will depend on its ability to conduct operations  to evaluate and select suitable properties and to consummate transactions in this highly competitive environment 
in addition  most of the competitors have been operating in the gulf of mexico for a much longer time than the company has and have demonstrated the ability to operate through industry cycles 
the company cannot control the activities on properties it does not operate 
other companies operate some of the properties in which the company has an interest  including front runner 
as a result  the company has a limited ability to exercise influence over operations for these properties or their associated costs 
the company s dependence on the operator and other working interest owners for these projects and its limited ability to influence operations and associated costs could materially and adversely affect the realization of its targeted returns on capital in drilling or acquisition activities 
the success and timing of drilling and development activities on properties operated by others therefore depend upon a number of factors that are outside of the company s control  including timing and amount of capital expenditures  the operator s expertise and financial resources  approval of other participants in drilling wells and selection of technology 
the company may have difficulty financing its planned growth 
the company has experienced and expects to continue to experience substantial capital expenditure and working capital needs  particularly as a result of its drilling program 
in the future  the company expects it will require additional financing  in addition to cash generated from its operations  to fund its planned growth 
the company cannot be certain that additional financing will be available on acceptable terms or at all 
in the event additional capital resources are unavailable  the company may curtail its drilling  development and other activities or be forced to sell some of its assets on an untimely or unfavorable basis 
warburg owns a significant number of shares of common stock  giving it influence in corporate transactions and other matters  and the interests of warburg could differ from those of other stockholders 
at december   warburg owned approximately of the outstanding shares of common stock 
as a result  warburg is in a position to significantly influence the outcome of matters requiring a stockholder vote  including the election of directors  the adoption of an amendment to the certificate of incorporation or bylaws and the approval of mergers and other significant corporate transactions 
its influence over spinnaker may delay or prevent a change of control of the company and may adversely affect the voting and other rights of other stockholders 
furthermore  conflicts of interest could arise in the future between the company and warburg concerning  among other things  potential competitive business activities or business opportunities 
warburg is not restricted from competitive natural gas and oil exploration and production activities or investments 
warburg currently has significant equity interests in other public and private natural gas and oil companies 
the interests of warburg could differ from those of other stockholders 
a portion of the company s outstanding shares owned by warburg or other significant stockholders may be sold into the market in the near future 
this could cause the market price of the common stock to drop significantly  even if the company s business is doing well 
the market price of the common stock could drop due to sales of a large number of shares of common stock in the market or the perception that such sales could occur 
this could make it more difficult to raise funds through any future offering of common stock 
the certificate of incorporation and bylaws contain provisions that could discourage an acquisition or change of control of the company 
the certificate of incorporation authorizes the board of directors to issue preferred stock without stockholder approval 
if the board of directors elects to issue preferred stock  it could be more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company  even if that change of control might be beneficial to stockholders 
in addition  provisions of the certificate of incorporation and bylaws  such as no stockholder action by written consent and limitations on stockholder proposals at meetings of stockholders  could also make it more difficult for a third party to acquire control of the company 
terrorist attacks on natural gas and oil production facilities  transportation systems and storage facilities could have a material adverse impact on the company s business 
natural gas and oil production facilities  transportation systems and storage facilities could be targets of terrorist attacks 
these attacks could have a material adverse impact if certain natural gas and oil infrastructure integral to the company s operations were destroyed or damaged 
critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities as of the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
significant estimates include depreciation  depletion and amortization dd a of proved natural gas and oil properties 
natural gas and oil reserve estimates  which are the basis for unit of production dd a and the full cost ceiling test  are inherently imprecise and are expected to change as future information becomes available 
in addition  alternatives may exist among various accounting methods 
in such cases  the choice of accounting method may also have a significant impact on reported amounts 
the company s critical accounting policies are as follows full cost method of accounting the company uses the full cost method of accounting for its investments in natural gas and oil properties 
under this method  all acquisition  exploration and development costs  including certain related employee costs  incurred for the purpose of exploring for and developing natural gas and oil are capitalized 
acquisition costs include costs incurred to purchase  lease or otherwise acquire property 
exploration costs include the costs of drilling exploratory wells  including those in progress  geological and geophysical service costs and depreciation of support equipment used in exploration activities 
development costs include the costs of drilling development wells and costs of completions  platforms  facilities and pipelines 
costs associated with production and general corporate activities are expensed in the period incurred 
sales of natural gas and oil properties  whether or not being amortized currently  are accounted for as adjustments of capitalized costs  with no gain or loss recognized  unless such adjustments would significantly alter the relationship between capitalized costs and proved reserves of natural gas and oil 
application of the full cost method of accounting for oil and gas properties generally results in higher capitalized costs  no exploration costs and higher dd a rates than the application of the successful efforts method of accounting 
dd a the company computes the provision for dd a of natural gas and oil properties using the unit of production method based upon production and estimates of proved reserve quantities 
unevaluated costs and related carrying costs are excluded from the amortization base until the properties associated with these costs are evaluated 
in addition to costs associated with evaluated properties  the amortization base includes estimated future development costs and dismantlement  restoration and abandonment costs  net of estimated salvage values 
certain future development costs may be excluded from amortization when incurred in connection with major development projects expected to entail significant costs to ascertain the quantities of proved reserves attributable to the properties under development 
the amounts that may be excluded are portions of the costs that relate to the major development project and have not previously been included in the amortization base and the estimated future expenditures associated with the development project 
such costs may be excluded from costs to be amortized until the earlier determination of whether additional reserves are proved or impairment occurs 
as of december   the company excluded from the amortization base estimated future expenditures of million associated with common development costs for its deepwater discovery at front runner 
this estimate of future expenditures associated with common development costs is based on existing proved reserves to total proved reserves expected to be established upon completion of the front runner project 
if the million had been included in the amortization base as of december   and no additional reserves were assigned to the front runner project  the dd a rate in would have been per mcfe  or an increase of over the actual dd a rate of per mcfe 
all future development costs associated with the deepwater discovery at front runner are included in the determination of estimated future net cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves used in the full cost ceiling calculation  as discussed below 
full cost ceiling capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties  net of accumulated dd a and related deferred taxes  are limited to the estimated future net cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves  including the effects of hedging activities in place as of december   discounted at  plus the lower of cost or fair value of unproved properties  as adjusted for related income tax effects full cost ceiling 
if capitalized costs of the full cost pool exceed the ceiling limitation  the excess is charged to expense 
as of december   the company s full cost ceiling  including estimated future net cash flows calculated using commodity prices of per mcf of natural gas and per barrel of oil and condensate  exceeded capitalized costs of natural gas and oil properties  net of accumulated dd a and related deferred taxes  by approximately million 
considering the volatility of natural gas and oil prices  it is probable that the company s estimate of discounted future net cash flows from proved natural gas and oil reserves will change in the near term 
if natural gas or oil prices decline  even if for only a short period of time  or if the company has downward revisions to its estimated proved reserves  it is possible that write downs of natural gas and oil properties could occur in the future 
capitalized employee and other general and administrative costs under the full cost method of accounting  certain costs are capitalized that are directly identified with acquisition  exploration and development activities 
these capitalized costs include salaries  employee benefits  costs of consulting services and other related costs and do not include costs related to production  general corporate overhead or similar activities 
spinnaker capitalized employee and other general and administrative costs of million  million and million in  and  respectively 
unproved properties the costs associated with unproved properties and properties under development are not initially included in the amortization base and relate to unevaluated leasehold acreage and delay rentals  seismic data  wells in progress and wells pending determination 
unevaluated leasehold costs and delay rentals are either transferred to the amortization base with the costs of drilling the related well or are assessed quarterly for possible impairment or reduction in value 
unevaluated leasehold costs and delay rentals are transferred to the amortization base if a reduction in value has occurred 
the costs of seismic data are transferred to the amortization base using the sum of the year s digits method over a period of six years 
the costs associated with wells in progress and wells pending determination are transferred to the amortization base once a determination is made whether or not proved reserves can be assigned to the property 
the costs of drilling exploratory dry holes and associated leasehold costs are included in the amortization base immediately upon determination that the well is unsuccessful 
natural gas and oil reserves the process of estimating natural gas and oil reserves is complex 
it requires various assumptions  including natural gas and oil prices  drilling and operating expenses  capital expenditures  taxes and availability of funds 
the company must project production rates and timing of development expenditures 
the company analyzes available geological  geophysical  production and engineering data  and the extent  quality and reliability of this data can vary 
therefore  estimates of natural gas and oil reserves are inherently imprecise 
actual future production  natural gas and oil prices  revenues  taxes  development expenditures  operating expenses and quantities of recoverable natural gas and oil reserves most likely will vary from estimates 
any significant variance could materially affect the estimated quantities and net present value of reserves 
in addition  the company may adjust estimates of proved reserves to reflect production history  results of exploration and development  prevailing natural gas and oil prices and other factors  many of which are beyond the company s control 
at december   approximately of the company s proved reserves were either undeveloped or non producing 
because most of the reserve estimates are not based on a lengthy production history and are calculated using volumetric analysis  these estimates are less reliable than estimates based on a lengthy production history 
at december   approximately of the company s proved reserves were undeveloped and primarily related to front runner 
recovery of undeveloped reserves generally requires significant capital expenditures and successful drilling operations 
the reserve data assumes that the company will make these expenditures 
although the company estimates its reserves and the costs associated with developing them in accordance with industry standards  the estimated costs may be inaccurate  development may not occur as scheduled and results may not be as estimated 
other property and equipment the costs associated with seismic hardware and software are included in other property and equipment 
these costs are amortized into the full cost pool using the straight line method over three years

commodity price risk management activities on january   the company adopted statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 as amended  accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no

sfas no 
requires that changes in a derivative s fair value be realized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
accounting for qualifying hedges allows derivative gains and losses to offset related results on the hedged items in the statement of operations and requires a company to formally document  designate and assess the effectiveness of transactions that qualify for hedge accounting

 accounting for stock based compensation  encourages  but does not require  companies to record compensation cost for stock based employee compensation plans at fair value 
the company has chosen to account for stock based compensation using the intrinsic value method prescribed in apb opinion no 
 accounting for stock issued to employees  and related interpretations 
accordingly  compensation cost for stock options is measured as the excess  if any  of the fair value of the common stock at the date of the grant over the amount an employee must pay to acquire the common stock 
related parties the company purchases oilfield goods  equipment and services from baker hughes incorporated baker hughes  cooper cameron corporation cooper cameron and other oilfield services companies in the ordinary course of business 
the company incurred charges of approximately million and million in and  respectively  from affiliates of baker hughes  of which mr 
michael e 
wiley  a director of spinnaker since march  serves as chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president 
the company incurred charges of approximately million  million and million in  and  respectively  from cooper cameron  of which mr 
sheldon r 
erikson  a director of spinnaker  serves as chairman of the board  chief executive officer and president 
spinnaker believes that these transactions are at arm s length and the charges it pays for such goods  equipment and services are competitive with the charges and fees of other companies providing oilfield goods  equipment and services to the oil and gas exploration and production industry
