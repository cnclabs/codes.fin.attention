fiscal as compared to fiscal effective april   the company purchased all of the outstanding common stock  as well as a portion of the preferred stock  of kimmel automotive  inc based in baltimore  maryland 
in june  the company purchased the remaining preferred stock 
kimmel automotive operated tire and automotive repair stores in maryland and virginia  as well as wholesale and truck tire divisions including two commercial stores 
effective june   the company sold the truck tire division 
the results of operations of kimmel since its acquisition are included in the consolidated results of the company for the twelve months ended march  the acquired operations were accretive to earnings for the twelve months ended march  sales for fiscal increased million  or to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase of approximately

comparable store sales increased 
there were selling days in fiscal years and during the year  stores were added and four were closed 
at march   the company had stores in operation 
management believes that the improvement in sales resulted from several factors aimed at driving store traffic  including an increase in the number of oil changes performed  an increase in scheduled maintenance services and an increase in commercial fleet business 
coupled with price increases in areas such as shop supply and environmental fees  as well as in some product categories  the company was able to offset the continuing decline in exhaust sales 
the exhaust decline resulted  in part  from manufacturers use beginning in the mid s and completed in the mid s of non corrosive stainless steel exhaust systems on almost all new cars which has extended the life of exhaust systems and resulted in declining exhaust sales 
the company introduced scheduled maintenance services in all of its stores late in the fourth quarter of fiscal these services are required by vehicle manufacturers to comply with warranty schedules  and are offered by monro in a more convenient and cost competitive fashion than auto dealers can provide 
management believes that these services  which are offered both in bundled packages and individually  will continue to contribute positively to comparable store sales in future years  and help mitigate the aforementioned decline in exhaust which negatively impacted recent fiscal years 
additionally  the company continued to reward store employees with pay programs focused on high customer service scores 
management believes that  in spite of the current tough economic environment  it is continuing to build the trust of its customers  through quality  integrity and fair pricing  and is gaining an advantage over some of its competitors 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to a decline in technician labor costs as well as distribution and occupancy costs which are included in cost of sales 
as comparable store sales improve  the company is able to better leverage the latter costs  many of which are fixed 
technician labor costs improved due to better operational control and improved productivity  as measured by sales per man hour 
since the company began formally tracking this statistic over the last six years  productivity has increased every year  and since fiscal  is up 
these decreases were partially offset by an increase in material usage primarily related to a shift in mix  which includes a greater percentage of higher cost tire sales  since the acquisition of kimmel 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million to million and  as a percentage of sales  increased by 
as compared to fiscal the increase is primarily due to increased store manager wages to improve the quality and retention of this highly important position for the company  increased health insurance costs  and increased performance based bonuses related to improved company results 
in addition  the company recorded a compensation charge in both fiscal years and associated with the vesting of performance based stock options granted in december to the company s chief executive officer 
the charge in fiscal year was approximately million as compared to 
million in fiscal these increases were partially offset by a decrease in depreciation on computer systems and vehicles 
operating income in fiscal of million  or of sales  increased by million from the fiscal level of million  due to the factors discussed above 
interest expense  net of interest income  decreased as a percent of sales from in fiscal to in fiscal the weighted average interest rate for the year ended march  was approximately lower than the rate of for the year ended march  additionally  the weighted average debt outstanding for the year ended march  decreased by approximately million from fiscal  resulting in a decrease in expense between the two years 
as noted above  the company discontinued amortization of goodwill in fiscal in accordance with sfas this change  along with net gains on disposals of fixed assets led to 
million of other income in fiscal as compared with other expense of 
million in fiscal the company s effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal and in fiscal net income for fiscal increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in fiscal  due to the factors discussed 
fiscal as compared to fiscal sales for fiscal increased by million  or 
to million as compared to million in fiscal the increase was due to an increase of approximately million from stores opened since april   as well as a comparable store sales increase of

during the year  four stores were added and one was closed 
at march   the company had stores in operation 
gross profit for fiscal was million or of sales  as compared with million or of sales for fiscal the improvement in gross profit as a percentage of sales is primarily attributable to a decline in distribution and occupancy costs which are included in cost of sales 
as comparable store sales improve  the company is able to better leverage these costs  many of which are fixed 
in addition  the company purposefully increased its spending in the building maintenance area in fiscal to improve its stores  both structurally and cosmetically 
this expense was scaled back in fiscal in fiscal  the company also reduced its accrual for real estate taxes for prior year taxes  which it believes will never be paid  related to closed stores

table of contents benefits of warehouse process improvements including more efficient distribution and increased backhauling  resulting in a reduction in this expense line 
technician labor  which is included in cost of sales  also declined slightly as compared to the prior year  due to improved productivity and control 
these declines were partially offset by an increase in material costs  primarily in the area of parts purchased outside the company s normal distribution system outside purchases 
outside purchases increased as a percent of sales due to the company s foray into new services where it may not always have the required parts in stock 
additionally  parts proliferation continues to present challenges 
material costs also increased due to a shift in mix from exhaust and brakes  which carry lower material costs  to tires and maintenance services  which carry higher material costs 
in addition  the lifo reserve increased for the first time in several years due to an increase in the government indices for auto parts and tires 
operating  selling  general and administrative expenses for fiscal increased by million to million and  as a percentage of sales  increased by 
as compared to fiscal three tenths of the increase  or 
million  is attributable to the compensation expense associated with the vesting of performance based stock options granted in december to the company s chief executive officer 
the options vested in the first quarter of fiscal when the company s stock traded at for consecutive trading days 
the balance of the increase is primarily due to increased depreciation related to the new store pos systems installed in fiscal  increased store manager wages to improve the quality and retention of store managers  and slightly less cooperative advertising credits earned in fiscal as compared to fiscal operating income in fiscal of million  or of sales  decreased by 
million from the fiscal level of million  due to the factors discussed above

the company s effective tax rate was of pre tax income in fiscal and in fiscal the company recorded a one time tax benefit of 
million in the quarter ended june   due to a reduction in the company s effective tax rate 
there has been a reduction in the company s overall effective state income tax rate because of the company s growth in lower taxing states  especially in connection with the fiscal year speedy acquisition 
this one time adjustment reduced the accrual for amounts provided in prior fiscal years 
additionally  this state rate reduction continued throughout fiscal year  and accordingly  the company reduced the provision for taxes from to of pre tax income for fiscal net income for fiscal increased by million  or  to million as compared to million in fiscal  due to the factors discussed above
