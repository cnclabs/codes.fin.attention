our eds business manufactures ct based detection products used by the aviation industry to screen baggage for explosives 
our wholly owned subsidiary  quantum  utilizes qr and magnetic sensing technologies for the inspection  detection and analysis of explosives  concealed weapons and other materials 
our wood division consists of inovec  which manufactures systems using laser based technologies to improve sawmill yield  and woodvision  which is developing our ct and x ray technology to increase the value of harvested timber 
our revenues are primarily comprised of eds product revenues  which include revenues from sales of ctx systems  related accessories and spare parts  and related installation and configuration  and eds service revenues  which include revenues from maintenance contracts related to product support  integration and other services  including those complex integrations and configurations that are separate from product revenues  quantum government contract revenues  which include revenues primarily from development contracts utilizing qr and magnetic sensing technologies with government agencies and private entities  and wood product revenues from the sales of control and automation systems for timber processing equipment and related accessories  installation and configuration  and service revenues from maintenance contracts related to product support  repairs and other services 
we market our products and services directly through internal sales personnel and indirectly through authorized agents  distributors and systems integrators 
in the united states  we market our products and services primarily through direct sales personnel 
internationally  we use a direct sales force and authorized representatives to sell our products 
international sales represented of total revenues for the year ended december   of total revenues for the year ended december  and of total revenues for the year ended december  eds 
in any given fiscal quarter or year  our eds product revenues are derived from orders of multiple units of our eds products from a limited number of customers 
for example  in  ten customers accounted for all of our eds units sold 
the number of our customers does not vary widely from period to period  and we are dependent on multiple orders from this small number of customers for a substantial portion of our revenues 
therefore  a cancellation or delay of an order from a customer could have a significant negative impact on our operations in a given period 
we generated million from eds sales to our largest customer  the faa and  following the formation of the tsa  the tsa  representing of total revenues for the year ended december   million representing of total revenues for the year ended december   and million representing of total revenues for the year ended december  there were no other eds customers who accounted for more than of total revenues in the years ended december   and we typically bill our customers in three stages  as generally provided in our contracts with our customers amounts to cover the bill of materials when materials are received from suppliers  typically to of the total system price  an additional amount upon factory acceptance or shipment  ranging from to  and the balance upon installation and site acceptance  ranging from to 
these payment terms effectively provide the necessary working capital for acquisition of materials and funding inventory during the manufacturing cycle 
we anticipate that potential future orders from the tsa will continue to provide payment terms which provide the necessary working capital for us and our suppliers  even if production volumes were to rapidly increase 
if future orders from the tsa contain different payment terms  a major increase in production rates may require substantial additional working capital 
payment terms for faa and tsa invoices are net days  while terms for international invoices vary from amounts due upon receipt of invoice to days 
we consider research and development to be a vital part of our operations and continue to dedicate substantial resources to research to enhance the performance  functionality and reliability of our ctx systems  as well as development of new products 
gross research and development expenses for eds were million in  million in and million in quantum 
our quantum revenues are substantially derived from development activities funded by various us government contract agencies 
the government contract revenues are from contracts which are typically in the form of cost plus fixed fee or firm fixed price awards 
we sold our first qscan product in late and our first i portal system in  and continue to market these products to customers within the aviation and transportation security markets 
we also perform independent research and development activities at quantum which are not directly funded through us government contracts or grants 
many of these activities explore ways to utilize those technologies which are developed or improved under directly funded government contracts 
internal research and development activity levels can fluctuate with the level of identified internal research and development projects and with the resource requirements of funded government contracts and grants 
wood 
our wood product and service revenues are primarily derived from inovec s sales of control and automation systems for timber processing equipment and related service 
we have installed laser scanners in over sawmills worldwide

eds product revenues were million in  an increase of  from million in this increase in system sales and related accessories reflects the orders received from the faa and the tsa during  as well as international customers in late and  resulting from the increased focus on aviation security following the terrorist attacks of september  the increase in eds product revenues is slightly offset by volume discounts 
eds service revenues were million in  an increase of from million in the increase in service revenues is a result of signing an agreement with siemens  which was retroactive to november  to service our eds units owned by the faa and the tsa in the united states and its territories and service contract revenues from international customers for new support and maintenance agreements for ctx systems for which warranty periods expired during the year 
we anticipate that service revenues will increase in compared to due to the agreement with siemens and a larger installed base of eds coming off of warranty 
we typically ship against a backlog of orders for our products 
as of december   we had in backlog eds equipment orders and service agreements of million 
quantum s government contract revenues were million in  a decrease of from million in during  million of our government contract revenues from the us government were for the development of landmine technologies  representing of quantum revenues  compared to  in which million of our government contract revenues from the us government were for the development of landmine technologies  representing of quantum revenues 
as of december   we had quantum government contract backlog of approximately million  approximately million of which is for the development of landmine detection technologies 
we anticipate that government contract revenues for landmine detection technologies will decrease in compared to this is the result of a reduced need for subcontract support for the landmines contracts as outsourced milestones are completed 
a reduction in such support needs reduces the amounts of revenue recognized in re billing subcontract support cost to the government 
in addition  quantum is shifting internal resources to develop an upgrade to the ctx family of explosives detection systems utilizing qr 
this project to combine qr and ct technology is partially funded by a grant of million by the tsa 
quantum s product revenues were million in  compared to  in quantum did not have a commercial product until the increase in quantum s product revenues in is primarily due to increased sales of i portal systems during a greater span of time compared to the same period in wood product revenues were million in  a decrease of from million in the decrease in wood product revenues is primarily due to fewer system and machinery equipment sales  both reflecting softness in the wood products industry in compared to wood service revenues were million in  an increase of from million in the increase in wood service revenues is primarily due to increased replacement part sales and increased customer purchases of spare parts 
as of december   we had in backlog inovec equipment orders and service agreements of  for laser based optimization and scanning systems for lumber manufacturing 
gross profit 
cost of eds product revenues primarily consists of purchased materials procured for use in the assembly of our products  as well as manufacturing labor and overhead  installation  training and warranty 
cost of eds service revenues primarily consists of direct labor and materials  and customer support overhead 
in any given period our gross profit for products and services may be affected by several factors  including revenue mix  volume of systems manufactured in a given period  product configuration  location of the installation and complexity of integration into various environments 
gross profit for eds products was million in  an increase of  from million in gross margins for eds products were in and in in addition to significant tsa shipments in  the improvement in eds product gross profit was partially due to amounts reimbursable from the tsa for ramp up costs  which consist of consulting expenses  vendor expedite charges and subcontractor manufacturing set up costs  totaling million 
if this amount were not reimbursable  these elements of ramp up costs would have been expensed 
the overall improvement in product gross profit was partially offset by million in inventory write downs and accrued vendor cancellation fees 
during  in anticipation of receiving additional tsa orders for our ctx ds model  we purchased and made commitments to purchase large quantities of critical components to build ctx ds machines 
these anticipated tsa orders were largely replaced by orders for our ctx dsi model and  at year end  our ctx ds raw material inventory levels were in excess of our anticipated requirements 
accordingly  we wrote down a portion of our ctx ds inventory and accrued cancellation fees which taken together totaled million during the improvement in eds product gross margin percentages is primarily due to lower manufacturing overhead per unit  resulting from a larger increase in units produced relative to the increase in fixed costs during gross profit for eds services was million in  an increase of from million in gross margins for eds services were in and in the decrease in gross margin percentages is primarily due to the need to increase eds customer support overhead costs necessary to support an increasing installed base of eds units 
because product sales are initially covered for support services under warranty  there is approximately a to month time lag from shipment to recognizing significant service contract revenue tied to the increased sales of eds products 
however  the eds product customer is not obligated to purchase support services from us after the warranty period  so additional service contract revenues are not assured by product sales 
the increased support costs with no immediate service revenue for recent product sales was the primary reason for lower gross margin for compared to that in cost of quantum government contract revenues primarily consists of direct labor  purchased materials  subcontract labor and the applicable overhead required to support government funded activities 
gross profit for government contracts was million in  a decrease from million in gross margins for government contracts were in and in the decrease in gross profit is primarily due to lower government contract revenues in compared to the improvement in gross margin percentages for government contracts is primarily due to fewer outside engineering services being required on a landmines contract  in which related services typically carry a slightly lower margin  in compared to gross profit for wood products was million in  a decrease of from million in gross margins for wood products were in and in the decrease in wood products gross profit and gross margin percentages is primarily due to softness in the industry 
gross profit for wood services was  in  an increase of from  in gross margins for wood services were in and in the increase in gross profit for wood services is primarily due to higher service revenues in compared to the prior year using the same number of service personnel 
the increase in gross margin percentages for wood services is primarily due to variations in types of services provided in compared to research and development 
research and development expenses consist primarily of compensation paid to personnel engaged in research and development activities  amounts paid for outside services and costs of materials utilized in the development of hardware products  including prototype units 
research and development expenditures are partially offset by amounts reimbursed by the faa  the tsa and other government agencies and private entities under research and development contracts and grants 
these services are provided and reimbursed on a cost basis 
gross research and development expenses for eds were million in  an increase of from million in gross research and development expenses for eds as a percentage of eds revenues were in and in net research and development expenses for eds were million in  an increase of compared to million in net research and development expenses for eds as a percentage of eds revenues were in and in the increase in gross research and development expenses for eds is primarily due to an increased focus on several initiatives to support our growth 
with the goal of checked baggage screening in us airports  we expect that our eds machines will be operated at or near capacity for extended periods 
we are investing in sustaining engineering efforts to ensure that our products achieve high levels of serviceability and reliability when operated at capacity 
we are also devoting significant engineering resources to support the rapid expansion of our manufacturing capacity  and are continuing our development of the argus program  an faa sponsored program designed to develop a smaller  low cost eds product to scan checked baggage in small airports and low traffic stations within larger airports  and product enhancements for our existing line of eds machines 
we anticipate that we will commit less engineering resources in for the argus program since that program is nearing completion 
the increase in net research and development expenses for eds is primarily due to quantum s development of an upgrade to the ctx family of explosives detection systems utilizing qr and less funding received from the argus grant in the current year compared to the prior year 
we anticipate that we will continue to incur unfunded costs for the continued development of the argus program over the next few quarters as we approach the end of the program 
the decrease of gross and net research and development expenses for eds as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to a significant increase in revenues 
research and development expenses for quantum were  in  an increase of from  in research and development expenses for quantum as a percentage of quantum revenues were in and in the increase in expenses is primarily due to more internal costs incurred for the development and commercialization of products in compared to  such as the i portal system 
the increase of research and development expenses for quantum as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to a decrease in revenues 
research and development expenses for wood were million in  a decrease of from million in research and development expenses for wood as a percentage of wood revenues were in and in the decrease in expenses is primarily due to a temporary reallocation of engineering resources to support the rapid growth of the eds business from wood development efforts 
the increase of research and development expenses for wood as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to a decrease in revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses consist primarily of compensation paid to direct and indirect sales and marketing personnel  administrative personnel  including directors  consultant fees  professional service fees  insurance  travel  selling and distribution costs and other general expenses 
selling  general and administrative expenses for eds were million in  an increase of from million in selling  general and administrative expenses for eds as a percentage of eds revenues were in and in part of the increase in expenses for eds was the result of an increase in expenditures to consultants and professional fees of million  such as investigations relating to potential acquisitions and investor and public relations  employee headcount of million  insurance costs of million and sales commissions of million  all related to the growth of our business compared to the prior year 
the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses for eds as a percentage of revenues is primarily due to the increase in eds revenues 
selling  general and administrative expenses for quantum were constant at million in and selling  general and administrative expenses for quantum as a percentage of quantum revenues were in and in the increase as a percentage of revenues is due to a decrease in total revenue 
selling  general and administrative expenses for wood were million in  an increase of from million in selling  general and administrative expenses for wood as a percentage of wood revenues were in and in the net increase in selling  general and administrative expenses is primarily due to a million impairment write down of goodwill related to the acquisition of inovec  partially offset by reductions in headcount and efforts to control expenses 
the increase as a percentage of revenue is due to a decrease in total revenue and to the million impairment write down 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to  in from  in the increase in interest expense is primarily due to increased activities within our financing for insurance premiums  and increased activities within our lines of credit  such as more standby letters of credit issued to secure guarantees to customers  in compared to that in interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net was  in compared to  in the amount consists primarily of interest income on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of million  offset by other expenses of million  primarily consisting of million of net foreign exchange losses primarily related to foreign exchange contracts entered into in advance of adopting hedge accounting in may and a contingent settlement amount of  the amount consists primarily of interest income on cash equivalents and short term investments of  and other income net of  primarily the reversal of a reserve due to a favorable outcome of an international claim  partially offset by foreign exchange losses 
provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax provision of million in compared with an income tax benefit of million in at december   we had federal and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and  respectively  available to reduce future federal and state taxable income 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and our state net operating loss carryforwards expire in the tax benefit of the net operating loss carryforwards may be limited due to the impact of the tax reform act of events which may cause the tax benefit to be limited include  but are not limited to  a cumulative stock ownership change of more than over a three year period and the timing of utilization of various tax benefits carried forward 
comparison of fiscal years and revenues 
eds product revenues were million in  a decrease of from million in this decrease was primarily attributable to decreased ctx system revenue of approximately million  resulting from fewer ctx systems sold in compared to  and also due to relatively more of the newer  lower priced ctx systems sold to existing customers in compared to the decrease was also due to a million reduction of revenues from fewer customer upgrades of the older ctx systems to the newer ctx ds systems 
the upgrades were mostly complete at the end of the decrease in eds product revenues was partially offset by increased accessories and spare parts revenues in  as more systems were deployed and operating in the field in compared to eds service revenues were million in  an increase of from million in the increase in service revenues was primarily due to increased service contract revenues from international customers for new support and maintenance agreements for ctx systems for which warranty periods expired during the year 
the increase in eds service revenue was also due to more non contract services  such as billed time and material services  data reporting and complex integrations  provided on a greater installed base of systems in compared to we typically ship against a backlog of orders for our products 
as of december   we had in backlog eds equipment orders and service agreements of million 
quantum s government contract revenues were million in  an increase of from million in the increase in government contract revenues was primarily due to an increase in efforts in the development of landmine and concealed weapons detection technologies  partially offset by decreases in other types of development efforts as those government contracts and grants were completed during the last twelve months 
due to expanded efforts to develop landmine detection technologies in  quantum employed more individuals to work directly on funded projects  as well as increased subcontract support  compared to the same period in during  million of our government contract revenues from the us government were for the development of landmine technologies  representing of quantum revenues  compared to  in which million of our government contract revenues from the us government were for the development of landmine technologies  representing of quantum revenues 
as of december   we had quantum government contract backlog of approximately million  primarily for the development of landmine detection technologies 
quantum s product revenues were  in  compared to  in wood product revenues were million in  a decrease of from million in the decrease in wood product revenues was primarily due to fewer system sales and also due to fewer machinery equipment sales  both reflecting a softness in the wood products industry in compared to wood service revenues were constant at million for each of the years ended december  and as of december   we had in backlog inovec equipment orders and service agreements of million for laser based optimization and scanning systems for lumber manufacturing 
gross profit 
gross profit for eds products was million in  a decrease of from million in gross margins for eds products in were and in the decrease in gross profit was primarily due to lower eds product revenues in compared to the increase in eds product gross margin percentages was primarily due to improvements in the manufacturing costs of the ctx dsi system  which was first introduced in late  and due to competitive pricing factors with international customers in the prior year 
the increase in gross margin percentages was also due to variations in product types and accessories sold in compared to the increase in revenues from accessories  which typically carry higher margins  in added to the improvement in eds product margins compared to gross profit for eds services was million in  an increase of from million in gross margins for eds services were in and in the increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher eds service revenues in compared to the increase in eds service gross margin percentages was primarily due to variations in types of service revenue  such as increased billed time and materials services  and continued efforts to maintain constant overhead costs with a greater installed base of ctx systems in compared to the increase in gross margin percentages for eds services was also due to revenues recorded in for services which were performed in the revenues for these services were deferred in the prior year due to uncertainty of collection of the receivable at the end of the year 
the revenues for these services were recognized in the current year due to the collection of the receivable in gross profit for government contracts was million in  a increase from million in gross margins for government contracts were in and in the increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher government contract revenues in compared to  partially offset by decreased margins 
the decrease in gross margin percentages was primarily due to increased outside engineering services utilized on the landmines contract in compared to  which services typically carry lower margins 
gross profit for wood products was million in  a decrease of from million in gross margins for wood products were in and in the decrease in wood products gross profit was primarily due to lower revenues in compared to the increase in wood products gross margin percentages was primarily due to a smaller portion of revenues attributable to machinery equipment  which typically carry a lower margin than system revenues  in compared to gross profit for wood services was  in  an increase of from  in gross margins for wood services were in and in the increase in gross profit was primarily due to higher service revenues in compared to the increase in wood service gross margin percentages was primarily due to variations in types of services provided in compared to research and development 
gross research and development expenses for eds were million in  an increase of from million in research and development contracts and grants from the faa and other government agencies and private entities funded million of our gross research and development expenses for eds in and  in net research and development expenses for eds were million in  a decrease of compared to million in net research and development expenses for eds as a percentage of eds revenues were in and in the increase in gross research and development expenses for eds was primarily due to the expanded efforts on the argus program during compared to the decrease in net research and development expenses was primarily due to the focused efforts on the argus development  which was funded through research and development grants 
as of december   we had in backlog research and development contracts and grants of  representing the remaining available funding of the argus program 
research and development expenses for quantum were  in  an increase of from  in research and development expenses for quantum as a percentage of quantum revenues was in and the increase in expenses was primarily due to more internal costs incurred for the development and commercialization of products in compared to  such as the i portal system 
research and development expenses for wood were million in  an increase of from million in research and development expenses for wood as a percentage of wood revenues were in and in the increase in expenses was primarily due to the increased efforts during the first half of for field trials and other research on the development of a log scanning system based on ct technology to optimize the value of harvested timber 
the increase in expenses as a percentage of revenues was due to an increase in expenses and an decrease in wood product revenues 
selling  general and administrative 
selling  general and administrative expenses for eds were million in  a decrease of from million in selling  general and administrative expenses for eds as a percentage of eds revenues were in and in the decrease in eds selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to our efforts to reduce selling  general and administrative spending levels in the first part of compared to  primarily in the areas of employee headcount  travel and entertainment and professional services 
the decrease was also due to the reimbursement by the faa of the selling  general and administrative portion of expenses related to the argus program of million in compared to  in  due to expanded efforts on the argus development in these decreases were partially offset by increased external commission expense for certain international sales representatives in compared to and also due to increases in employee headcount  bonuses  consultants  and professional fees  such as investor and public relations  incurred in late in anticipation of greater demand for our eds products 
the decrease in eds selling  general and administrative expenses was also partially offset by approximately  of non recurring professional fees incurred in the latter part of related to a possible acquisition which is no longer being pursued 
selling  general and administrative expenses for quantum were constant at million in and selling  general and administrative expenses for quantum as a percentage of quantum revenues were in and in the decrease as a percentage of revenues was due to our efforts to maintain selling  general and administrative spending levels with expanded efforts on government contract projects 
selling  general and administrative expenses for wood were million in  a decrease of from million in selling  general and administrative expenses for wood as a percentage of wood revenues were in and in the decrease in selling  general and administrative expenses was primarily due to start up and business development costs incurred in for the newly formed woodvision division 
interest expense 
interest expense increased to  in from  in interest expense resulted primarily from debt financing associated with our working capital lines of credit  equipment term loans  capital leases and financing for insurance premiums 
the increase was primarily due to higher average debt balances during the year in compared to  partially offset by lower interest rates 
interest and other income  net 
interest and other income  net  was  in compared to  in the amount consisted primarily of interest income on cash  cash equivalents and short term investments of  and other income net of  primarily the reversal of a reserve due to a favorable outcome of an international claim  partially offset by foreign exchange losses 
the amount consisted primarily of interest income on cash equivalents and short term investments of  partially offset by other expense of  primarily net foreign exchange losses 
the decrease in interest income was primarily due to lower average cash balances and lower interest rates on these balances during the year in compared to provision benefit for income taxes 
we recorded an income tax benefit of million in compared to no amounts recorded for taxes in during the fourth quarter of  we determined that a deferred tax asset valuation allowance was no longer necessary based on an evaluation of current evidence including  among other things  the passage of the transportation security act and its effect on our estimates of future earnings as well as contracts and customer orders entered into during the fourth quarter of accordingly  we reversed our deferred tax asset valuation allowance of million in the fourth quarter of  which more than offset the provision for the income tax expense 
at december   we had federal net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million and state net operating loss carryforwards of approximately million available to reduce future federal and state taxable income 
our federal net operating loss carryforwards begin to expire in and our state net operating loss carryforwards expire in our tax credit carryforwards of million expire from to related party transactions in connection with messrs 
blum and turpen joining our board of directors in  each of these directors received a grant to purchase  shares of our common stock  which grants vested over a four year period 
in february  the board of directors amended these grants to cause them to vest over a one year period 
if either mr 
blum or mr 
turpen ceases to be a director prior to four years from the original date of grant  we will be required to take a compensation charge equal to the difference between the fair market value of our common stock on the date of the amendment and the exercise price of the option  multiplied by the number of vested shares that would not have vested had the option not been amended 
in late september  we entered into an agreement with donald co 
for investment advisory services related to a potential acquisition and fundraising activities 
we considered other alternatives and chose donald co 
to provide these services because time was of the essence and it was able to react quickly to meet our business requirements based on its familiarity with our business 
stephen blum  president of donald co  is a member of our board of directors 
the board approved this agreement with mr 
blum abstaining 
under this agreement  donald co 
received a  cash retainer and a fully vested warrant to purchase  shares of our common stock at a price of per share  the closing price of our common stock on the day prior to the date of issuance 
the board considered this fee to be comparable to other alternatives given the circumstances of the engagement 
the warrant expires five years from date of issuance 
the fair value of the warrant was  which was estimated on the date of grant using the black scholes option pricing model with the following assumptions no dividends  risk free interest rate of  volatility of and a contractual life of five years 
in september  we issued  shares of common stock under the warrant 
however  in lieu of paying cash for the shares   shares valued at per share were returned to us to settle the transaction 
such shares were recorded as treasury stock 
we have allocated one half of the cash retainer and warrant to on going investment and financial advisory services  which was originally recorded in other current assets and then amortized over the one year term of the agreement 
we recorded amortization expense of  in and  in we have allocated the remaining balance of  to services provided in connection with our follow on offering in april  which was netted against the proceeds from the offering 
in august  january and january  we entered into consulting agreements with bgi  inc  a virginia based international consulting firm  to assist us with the marketing of our eds products to the us government 
under these agreements  we agreed to pay an annual retainer to bgi and a success fee payable in stock or stock options 
in november  bgi agreed to convert all of the accrued stock portion of its accumulated success fees and agreed to cancel an option to purchase  shares of common stock in consideration for an agreement by us to issue  shares of common stock to bgi 
in  we recorded consulting expenses of  for this common stock 
we issued  shares of common stock in and we issued the remaining  shares of common stock in in march  morris busby  president and a controlling shareholder of bgi  was elected to our board of directors 
following ambassador busby s election  we continued this arrangement because we felt that bgi continued to provide needed services to us at comparable market rates 
we paid consulting fees to bgi of  in this arrangement expired on december  noncash charges we recorded noncash charges related to grants of stock options having exercise prices below the fair market value on the date of grant to employees and directors in the amounts of  in and  in we did not record any noncash charges in related to grants of stock options having exercise prices below the fair value of our common stock on the date of grant 
we recorded noncash charges related to grants of a warrant to a director and stock options to a consultant in the amount of  in and  in no amounts were recorded for grants of warrants or stock options to non employees in we recorded a noncash charge related to the issuance of common stock to a consultant in the amount of  in liquidity and capital resources at december   we had million in cash and cash equivalents  compared to million at december  working capital was million at december  compared to million at december  net cash provided by operating activities was million in  compared to  in and to million used in the increase in cash flows from operations in resulted primarily from an increase in our earnings of approximately million  offset by a net decrease resulting from changes in operating assets and liabilities of approximately million 
changes in assets and liabilities reflected long lead deposits on delivery orders from the tsa resulting in an increase of million in deferred revenues  as well as an increase in accrued liabilities of million and an increase in accounts payable of million 
however  these increases in operating assets and liabilities were more than offset by customer receivables processed in late that contributed to a million growth of accounts receivable  and increases in inventory of million and prepayments of million  including long lead inventory deposits of million 
cash flows from operations in resulted primarily from an increase in earnings of million  which is enhanced by noncash items  such as million for depreciation and amortization during the year 
other contributing factors to the improvement in cash flows from operations were the timing of payments on accounts payable of million and the income tax benefits from employee stock transactions of million  partially offset by increases in inventory of million and accounts receivable of million 
net cash used in operating activities in resulted primarily from an increase in accounts receivable of million 
other contributing factors to the cash used in operations were a net loss of million  a build up increase of million in inventory  and a decrease in up front customer installment payments as of year end  resulting in a million decrease in deferred revenue 
the net use of cash in operating activities was partially offset by an increase of million in accrued liabilities and a million noncash effect of depreciation and amortization 
net cash used in investing activities was million in  compared to million in and to million provided by investing activities in net cash used in investing activities in resulted from million in acquisitions of capital equipment and  for the payment of an earn out to the former shareholders of inovec in accordance with the terms in the purchase agreement  offset by proceeds from the sale of short term investments of million 
net cash used in investing activities in resulted from million for the purchases of short term investments  million in acquisitions of capital equipment  and  for the payment of an earn out to the former shareholders of inovec in accordance with terms in the purchase agreement 
net cash provided by investing activities in primarily resulted from million in sales of short term investments  partially offset by million in acquisitions of capital equipment and the cash payment of million for the purchase of inovec  net of cash acquired 
net cash provided by financing activities was million in  compared to million in and to million in net cash provided by financing activities in primarily resulted from million in net proceeds from the sale of common stock to the public and under the employee stock purchase plan and exercises of stock options  partially offset by million in repayments of short term debt  net of proceeds 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to million in proceeds from sales under the employee stock purchase plan and exercises of stock options and million in proceeds from borrowings of short term debt  net of payments  partially offset by  in repayments of long term debt 
net cash provided by financing activities in was primarily due to  in proceeds from borrowings of short term debt   in proceeds from sales under the employee stock purchase plan and exercises of stock options  partially offset by  in repayments of long term debt 
effective july  we amended our two line of credit agreements with silicon valley bank 
the first agreement provides for maximum borrowings in an amount up to million 
the second agreement is partially guaranteed by the export import bank  or exim  of the united states and provides for maximum borrowings in an amount up to the lower of a the sum of to of eligible eds export accounts receivable plus the lower of of eligible raw materials and work in process inventory designated for export customers  or of outstanding loans under this agreement  or b million  which we expect will increase to million in following the approval of the increase of the guarantee by exim 
borrowings under these agreements bear interest at the bank s prime rate minus  which was at december  the agreements expire in july and require that the eds segment maintain certain levels of tangible net worth 
we may use proceeds of loans under both lines of credit for general corporate purposes 
at december   we had no borrowings outstanding under these agreements 
however  at december   we had outstanding guarantees to customers through the issuance of letters of credit for which a partial reserve of million is secured by the lines of credit  and foreign exchange contracts for which a reserve of million is secured by the lines of credit 
we had remaining available borrowing capacity under the lines of credit of million at december  based on eligible eds accounts receivable and inventories as of that date 
we previously borrowed against a committed equipment line of credit agreement with silicon valley bank  which converted into a term loan after draw down 
borrowings are secured by the assets purchased or financed 
at december   we had an outstanding  term loan due june the term loan bears interest at the bank s prime rate plus  which was at december  in august  inovec renewed a line of credit agreement with pacific continental bank

contractual obligations and commitments the following table depicts our contractual obligations as of december  in thousands payments due by period contractual obligations total less than year years thereafter short term debt long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases total contractual cash obligations at december   we have commitments of million for foreign currency forward contracts  which are used to hedge against existing receivables and orders 
these contracts expire within one year  when we will need to provide the euro currency from forecasted customer receipts to receive million 
we have no material obligations or commitments other than the obligations specified in the table above and the commitments specified in this paragraph 
we believe that existing cash  cash equivalents and short term investments  available borrowings under our lines of credits and funds expected to be generated from operations will be sufficient to finance our working capital and capital expenditure requirements for at least the next twelve months 
however  if we fail to meet required financial covenants in our credit agreements  or our receivables do not support the upper limits of these credit agreements  then we may not be able to have access to further funds under these agreements 
in addition  if we are unable to deliver eds units in a timely manner under our recent orders from the tsa or if we fail to adhere to the terms of the licensing agreement with the tsa  the tsa may cancel its orders or not place additional orders 
if any of these events occur  our capital resources would be significantly impaired 
inflation the impact of inflation has not been material on our operations  cash flow or liquidity to date 
critical accounting policies and estimates our discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations are based on our consolidated financial statements  which have been prepared in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
our preparation of these consolidated financial statements requires us to make judgments and estimates that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities  disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
we base our estimates on historical experience and on various other assumptions that we believe to be reasonable under the circumstances 
actual results may differ from such estimates under different assumptions or conditions 
the following summarizes our critical accounting policies and significant estimates used in preparing our consolidated financial statements revenue recognition 
we recognize revenues when persuasive evidence of an arrangement exists  delivery has occurred or services have been rendered  the price is fixed and determinable and collectibility is reasonably assured 
for sales of eds products to the faa and the tsa and other domestic customers that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment  we recognize product revenues at shipment and defer the portion of revenues relating to installation and training until these services are performed and accepted by the customer 
the deferred installation and training revenues are based on the fair value of these services and generally represent less than of these arrangements 
installation is generally completed within a relatively short period of time  typically less than one week 
we have a consistent history of completing routine installations and obtaining customer acceptance for domestic and international sales 
some airport installations require more involved integration with baggage handling systems and  while not essential to the functionality of the machine  take longer than most routine installations 
integration services are separately priced from products in sales agreements and we recognize service revenues under these agreements as services are performed 
sales of eds products and services to customers in foreign countries have varying contractual terms and are governed  in part  by regulations in foreign jurisdictions  accordingly  we recognize revenue based on the specific facts and circumstances surrounding each transaction 
revenue recognition on foreign sales is affected by our determination of when legal title and risk of loss pass to foreign customers as well as by our evaluation of our enforceable rights to unbilled amounts at the balance sheet date for transactions that have been recognized as revenues 
for foreign sales of eds products that have been demonstrated to meet product specifications prior to shipment  where title and risk of loss pass to the customer at shipment  and where we either have an enforceable claim at the balance sheet date for remaining unbilled amounts or have the ability to invoice the customer for any unbilled amounts after a fixed period of time regardless of whether installation is completed  we recognize product revenue at shipment and defer and recognize the fair value of installation and training revenue  if any  as services are performed 
for sales of eds products to foreign customers where title and risk of loss for such eds products pass upon completion of installation  we recognize product and service revenues at the completion of installation and acceptance by the customer 
in other sales of eds products to foreign customers where a portion of the contract price is withheld until installation is completed and where we do not believe we have an enforceable claim at the balance sheet date through which we can realize some or all of the withheld amount  we defer and recognize as revenue the greater of that portion of the contract price or the fair value of the installation and training at the completion of installation and acceptance by the customer 
we recognize revenues from quantum government contracts and from inovec product sales of automation and control systems using the percentage of completion method based on costs incurred to date as a percentage of total estimated costs at completion 
we record provisions for estimated losses on those contracts that are anticipated to result in losses at the completion of the contract 
the percentage of completion method relies on estimates of total expected contract revenue and costs 
we use this method of revenue recognition since reasonably dependable estimates of the revenue and costs applicable to various stages of a contract can be made 
recognized revenues and profit are subject to revisions as the contract progresses to completion 
inventory 
our inventory purchases and commitments are made in order to build inventory to meet future shipment schedules based on forecasted demand for our products 
the business environment in which we operate is subject to rapid changes in customer demand 
we perform a detailed assessment of inventory by segment each period  which includes a review of  among other factors  demand requirements  product life cycle and development plans  component cost trends  product pricing and quality issues 
based on this analysis  we record adjustments to inventory for excess  obsolescence or impairment  when appropriate  to reflect inventory at net realizable value 
revisions to our inventory adjustments may be required if actual demand  component costs or product life cycles differ from our estimates 
estimated cost down liability to the tsa 
the delivery orders received from the faa and tsa beginning in april are governed by a letter contract dated february  the contract specifies that product prices will be reduced by an amount equal to of actual bill of material savings 
while this contract has not yet been definitized  we have accrued a liability for the estimated amount of material cost savings to be shared with the tsa 
the estimate was determined by the quantity of product shipments to the tsa under the contract extended  for each model  by of the net decrease in the bill of materials for the production of those units shipped 
the estimated liability has been recorded as a reduction of revenues and  once the contract is definitized  the liability will be adjusted to reflect agreed upon payments to the tsa 
we anticipate that the contract will be definitized by the end of the second quarter of accrued warranty reserves 
we accrue the estimated cost of product warranties at the time revenues are recognized 
while we engage in extensive product quality programs and processes  including actively monitoring and evaluating the quality of our component suppliers  our warranty obligation is affected by actual warranty costs  including usage of material and labor and service delivery costs incurred in correcting a product failure 
if actual material usage or service delivery costs differ from our estimates  revisions to the estimated warranty liability would be required 
deferred tax asset valuation allowance 
we record a valuation allowance to reduce our deferred tax assets when it is more likely than not  based upon currently available evidence and other factors  that we will not realize some portion or all of our deferred tax assets 
we base our determination of the need for a valuation allowance on an on going evaluation of current evidence including  among other things  estimates of future earnings  the backlog of customer orders and the expected timing of deferred tax asset reversals 
we charge or credit adjustments to the valuation allowance to income tax expense in the period in which these determinations are made 
if we determine that we would be able to realize our deferred tax assets in the future in excess of its net recorded amount  an adjustment to the deferred tax asset would increase income in the period this determination was made 
likewise  if we determine that we would not be able to realize all or part of our net deferred tax assets in the future  we would charge to operations an adjustment to the deferred tax asset in the period this determination was made 
valuation of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets 
we review property  plant and equipment  goodwill and purchased intangible assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value of an asset may not be recoverable 
our asset impairment review assesses the fair value of the assets based on the future cash flows the assets are expected to generate 
an impairment loss is recognized when estimated discounted future cash flows expected to result from the use of the asset plus net proceeds expected from disposition of the asset  if any  are less than the carrying value of the asset 
this approach uses our estimates of future market growth  forecasted revenue and costs  expected periods the assets will be utilized and appropriate discount rates 
such evaluations of impairment of long lived assets  including goodwill and purchased intangible assets are an integral part of  but not limited to  our strategic reviews of our business and operations 
when an impairment is identified  the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its estimated fair value 
deterioration of our business in a geographic region or within a business segment in the future could also lead to impairment adjustments as such issues are identified 
recently issued accounting standards accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities 
in june  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for costs associated with exit or disposal activities  which addresses accounting for restructuring and similar costs 
sfas supersedes previous accounting guidance  principally emerging issues task force  or eitf  issue no 
we adopted the provisions of sfas for restructuring activities initiated after december  sfas requires that the liability for costs associated with an exit or disposal activity be recognized when the liability is incurred 
under eitf issue no 
 a liability for an exit costs was recognized at the date of a company s commitment to an exit plan 
sfas also establishes that the liability should initially be measured and recorded at fair value 
accordingly  sfas may affect the timing of recognizing future restructuring costs as well as the amounts recognized 
accounting for stock based compensation 
in december  the financial accounting standards board issued statement of financial accounting standards no 
 or sfas  accounting for stock based compensation transition and disclosure an amendment of fasb statement no 
 which provides alternative methods of transition for a voluntary change to the fair value based method of accounting for stock based employee compensation 
in addition  sfas amends the disclosure requirements of sfas no 
to require prominent disclosures in both annual and interim financial statements about the method of accounting for stock based employee compensation and the effect of the method used on reported results 
in the fourth quarter of  we adopted the amended disclosure requirements of sfas accounting and disclosure requirements for guarantees 
in november  the financial accounting standards board issued fasb interpretation no 
 or fin  guarantor s accounting and disclosure requirement for guarantees  including indirect guarantees of indebtedness of others 
fin requires that upon issuance of a guarantee  the guarantor must recognize a liability for the fair value of the obligation it assumes under that guarantee 
the disclosure provisions of fin are effective for financial statements of interim or annual periods that end after december  the provisions for initial recognition and measurement are effective on a prospective basis for guarantees that are issued or modified after december   irrespective of a guarantor s year end 
we have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of the recognition provisions of fin on our results of operations or financial position 
revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
in november  the eitf reached a consensus on eitf issue no 
 or eitf no 
 revenue arrangements with multiple deliverables 
eitf no 
addresses certain aspects of the accounting by a vendor for arrangements under which the vendor will perform multiple revenue generating activities 
eitf no 
will be effective for fiscal periods beginning after june  we have not yet determined the impact of the adoption of eitf no 
on our results of operations or financial position 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk our international system sales and maintenance contracts are generally denominated in us dollars 
in instances where there are significant international system sales contracts denominated in a foreign currency  we enter into forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange risk 
we do not enter into market risk sensitive instruments for trading purposes 
during the year ended december   we entered into foreign exchange forward contracts with notional values of approximately million to hedge against foreign exchange risk for contracts with international customers denominated in euros and  at december   had outstanding contracts with notional values totaling million with a negative fair value of approximately million 
the following table depicts the maturities of the outstanding contract amounts contract maturity within months months months months amount in thousands purchases of raw materials and other inventory components are primarily denominated in u 
s dollars and  when purchased in foreign currencies  are generally made on an as needed basis 
we have some advance purchase commitments in foreign currencies with a few european suppliers 
we currently do not hedge against these purchase commitments  as the foreign exchange rate fluctuations have not had a material adverse impact on these purchases  however  we will continue to monitor the foreign exchange rates and may enter into forward contracts to mitigate foreign exchange risk as appropriate 
certain costs of providing warranty and maintenance services for systems sold to foreign countries are denominated in local currencies 
to the extent exchange rates fluctuate  it could become more expensive to provide these services 
to date  these costs have not been significant  however  we expect they will increase as our installed base increases 
we are exposed to foreign currency exchange rate risk inherent in our sales commitments  anticipated sales  anticipated purchases and assets and liabilities denominated in currencies other than the us dollar 
we transact business in currencies worldwide  of which the most significant to our operations is the euro 
in some situations  we are a net receiver of foreign currencies and therefore benefit from a weaker us dollar and are adversely affected by a stronger us dollar relative to those foreign currencies in which we transact significant amounts of business 
we have performed a sensitivity analysis as of december   using a modeling technique that measures the change in the fair values arising from a hypothetical and adverse movement in the levels of foreign currency exchange rates relative to the us dollar that is  strengthening of the us dollar with all other variables held constant 
the analysis covers all of our foreign exchange forward contracts offset by the underlying exposures 
the foreign currency exchange rates used were based on market rates in effect at december  the cash flow impacts of the sensitivity analysis are summarized in the following table fair value as of dec 
 cash flow impact of change in exchange rates contract amount in thousands change change foreign currency forward contracts accounts receivable firm orders net accounts payable total firm orders represent orders for which we have received a signed purchase order 
the cash flow impact of changes in exchange rates at december  is not significantly different from the cash flow impact of changes in exchange rates at december  we do not expect the impact of changes in interest rates to have a material impact on our operations  cash flow or liquidity 
in addition  the impact of inflation has not been material on our operations  cash flow or liquidity to date
