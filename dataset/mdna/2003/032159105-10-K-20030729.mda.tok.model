as a result  a net charge to comprehensive loss of approximately million was recorded in in addition  the company s actuary has advised that a contribution to the plan will be required in for the plan year ended december   while the actuarial valuation has not yet been completed  it is estimated that the contribution could approximate million 
an additional contribution will likely be required for the plan year ended december  magazine distribution services contracts between kable and a number of publishing companies owned or controlled by a major shareholder and member of the board of directors of the company  which accounted for approximately of the company s revenues in  were scheduled to expire august  the parties have agreed to an extension of these contracts through november  under terms that provide for higher payments to the publishing companies than previously pertained but which are at terms no less favorable to kable than would be obtained in a comparable arm s length transaction with an unaffiliated publisher having the same volume of business 
efforts are being made by kable to renew the contracts for a longer term and to include additional magazines for which kable presently is not the distributor 
if kable is successful in these efforts  which cannot be assured  the results likely will involve similar increased payments to the publishing companies  which the company anticipates would partly be offset by revenue increases from expected higher distribution volumes and prices 
however  if these efforts are not successful  it is likely that the adverse impact on the company s operating results would be material 
cash flows from investing activities capital expenditures have remained comparable on a year to year basis 
the company believes that it has adequate financing capability to provide for anticipated capital expenditures

critical accounting policies and estimates the company prepares its financial statements in conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america 
the company discloses its significant accounting policies in the notes to its audited consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of such financial statements requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of those financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period 
following are some of the areas requiring significant judgments and estimates i revenue recognition for the magazine distribution business estimates of allowances for magazine returns  ii allowances for bad debts  iii land development budgets and costs to complete  iv cash flow and valuation assumptions in performing asset impairment tests of long lived assets and assets held for sale  v pension plan information  and vi legal contingencies 
actual results could differ from those estimates 
there are numerous critical assumptions that may influence accounting estimates in these and other areas 
management bases its critical assumptions on historical experience  third party data and various other estimates which are believed to be reasonable 
certain of the more critical assumptions include i distribution revenues represent commissions earned from the distribution of publications for client publishers which are recorded at the time the publications go on sale and which are generally sold on a fully returnable basis 
accordingly  management provides for estimated returns by charges to income which are determined on an issue by issue basis utilizing sales information and other relevant data  including publisher and like title history  ii management determines the allowance for doubtful accounts by attempting to identify troubled accounts by analyzing the credit risk of specific customers and by using historical experience applied to the aging of accounts and  where appropriate within the real estate business  by reviewing any collateral which may secure a receivable  iii real estate development costs are incurred throughout the life of a project  and the costs of initial sales from a project frequently must include a portion of costs that have been budgeted based on engineering estimates or other studies  but not yet incurred iv asset impairment determinations including that of goodwill are based upon the intended use of assets and expected future cash flows  v pension plan accounting and disclosure is based upon numerous assumptions and estimates  including the expected rate of investment return on retirement plan assets  the interest rate used to determine the present value of liabilities the discount rate  the rate of salary increases for employees and certain employee related factors  such as turnover  retirement age and mortality  and vi the company is currently involved in one legal proceeding which is described in item of the form k  and several other routine matters 
the legal proceeding described in item is still in an early stage  and it is not expected to come to trial before fiscal it is possible that the consolidated financial position or results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by a change in assumptions or the effectiveness of strategies related to these proceedings 
segment information information by industry segment is presented in note to the consolidated financial statements 
this information has been prepared in accordance with sfas no 
 disclosures about segments of an enterprise and related disclosures  which requires that industry segment information be prepared in a manner consistent with the manner in which financial information is prepared and evaluated by management for making operating decisions 
a number of assumptions and estimations are required to be made in the determination of segment data  including the need to make certain allocations of common costs and expenses among segments 
on an annual basis  management has evaluated the basis upon which costs are allocated  and has periodically made revisions to these methods of allocation 
accordingly  the determination of pretax income loss contribution of each segment as summarized in note to the consolidated financial statements is presented for informational purposes  and is not necessarily the amount that would be reported if the segment were an independent company 
impact of inflation operations of the company can be impacted by inflation 
within the industries in which the company operates  inflation can cause increases in the cost of materials  services  interest and labor 
unless such increased costs are recovered through increased sales prices  operating margins will decrease 
within the land development industry  the company encounters particular risks 
a large part of the company s real estate sales are to homebuilders who face their own inflationary concerns that rising housing costs  including interest costs  may substantially outpace increases in the income of potential purchasers and make it difficult for them to finance the purchase of a new home or sell their existing home 
if this situation were to exist  the demand for the company s land by these homebuilder customers could decrease 
in general  in prior years interest rates have been at historically low levels and other price increases have been commensurate with the general rate of inflation in the company s markets  and as a result the company has not found the inflation risk to be a significant problem in its real estate or magazine operations 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the primary market risk facing the company is interest rate risk on its long term debt 
the company does not hedge interest rate risk using financial instruments 
the company is also subject to foreign currency risk  but this risk is not material
