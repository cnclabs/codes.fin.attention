item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations 
forward looking statements statements contained in this report that are not historical fact  including management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations  are forward looking statements intended to qualify for the safe harbors from liability established by the private securities reform act of statements made that are not historical facts are forward looking and  accordingly  involve estimates  assumptions  risks and uncertainties that could cause actual results or outcomes to differ materially from those expressed in the forward looking statements 
actual results will depend  among other things  upon actions of regulators and legislators  pending sale of the company s wholly owned subsidiary connecticut valley electric company connecticut valley  performance of the vermont yankee nuclear power plant  weather conditions  and performance of the company s non regulated businesses 
the company cannot predict the outcome of any of these matters 
critical accounting policies preparation of the company s financial statements in accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the united states of america gaap requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect reported amounts of assets and liabilities  the disclosures of contingent assets and liabilities  and revenues and expenses 
note to the consolidated financial statements is a summary of significant accounting policies used in preparation of the company s financial statements 
the following is a discussion of the most critical accounting policies used by the company 
regulation the company is subject to regulation by the vermont public service board psb  the new hampshire public utilities commission nhpuc and the federal energy regulatory commission ferc  with respect to rates charged for service  accounting and other matters pertaining to regulated operations 
as such  the company currently prepares its financial statements in accordance with statement of financial accounting standards sfas no 
 accounting for the effects of certain types of regulation sfas no 
 for its regulated vermont service territory  ferc regulated wholesale businesses and connecticut valley s new hampshire service territory 
in order for a company to report under sfas no 
 a company s rates must be designed to recover its costs of providing service and the company must be able to collect those rates from customers 
if rate recovery becomes unlikely or uncertain  whether due to competition or regulatory action  this accounting standard would no lon ger apply to the company s regulated operations 
in the event the company determines that it no longer meets the criteria for applying sfas no 
 the accounting impact would be an extraordinary non cash charge to operations of approximately million on a pre tax basis as of december   assuming that no stranded cost recovery would be allowed through a rate mechanism 
criteria that could give rise to the discontinuance of sfas no 
include increasing competition that restricts the company s ability to establish prices to recover specific costs and a significant change in the manner in which rates are set by regulators from cost based regulation to another form of regulation 
management periodically reviews these criteria to ensure the continuing application of sfas no 
is appropriate 
based on a current evaluation of the various factors and conditions that are expected to impact future cost recovery  management believes future recovery of its regulatory assets in the state of vermont and the state of new hampshire for the company s retail and wholesale businesses is probable 
valuation of long lived assets the company periodically evaluates the carrying value of long lived assets and long lived assets to be disposed of  including its investments in nuclear generating companies  its unregulated investments  and its interests in jointly owned generating facilities  when events and circumstances warrant such a review 
the carrying value of such assets is considered impaired when the anticipated undiscounted cash flow from such an asset is separately identifiable and is less than its carrying value 
in that event  a loss is recognized based on the amount by which the carrying value exceeds the fair value of the long lived asset 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of impairment of non utility investments 
utility plant and maintenance utility plant is recorded at cost 
the cost of additions  including betterments and replacements of units of property  is charged to utility plant 
based on regulatory accounting  maintenance and repairs  including the cost of removing minor items of property  are expensed as incurred 
the cost of units of property replaced or retired  plus removal or disposal costs  less salvage  is charged to accumulated depreciation 
the company capitalizes direct costs and certain indirect costs  including the cost of debt and equity capital associated with construction and retirement activity  as prescribed by gaap and in accordance with regulatory practices 
page of depreciation the company has a significant investment in electric plant 
depreciable assets related to generation  transmission  distribution and general functions represent approximately percent of total depreciation 
the company depreciates these assets utilizing a composite rate  which currently includes a component for net negative salvage 
the company uses a straight line basis over the useful life of the related assets  which corresponds with the anticipated physical lives of these assets in most cases 
in order to substantiate the remaining physical lives of the investment in electric plant  outside consultants are engaged to perform depreciation studies on that property 
the most recent depreciation study was completed and implemented in the second quarter of as prescribed by gaap and regulatory practices  adjustments to the estimated depreciable lives of electric plant are recorded on a prospective basis 
purchased power the company records the annual cost of power obtained under long term contracts as operating expenses 
since these contracts do not convey to the company the right to use the related property  plant or equipment  they are considered executory in nature 
revenues revenues related to the sale of electricity are generally recorded when service is rendered or when electricity is distributed to customers 
electricity sales to individual customers are based on the monthly reading of their meters 
estimated unbilled revenues are recorded at the end of each monthly accounting period 
the company follows the accrual method of accounting for revenues  recognizing revenue for kilowatt hours that have been delivered but not yet billed through the end of the monthly accounting period 
the determination of unbilled revenues requires the company to make various estimates including energy generated  purchased and resold  losses of energy over transmission and distribution lines  kilowatt hour usage by retail customer mix residential  commercial and industrial  and average retail customer pricing rates 
unbilled revenues as of december   and were million  million and million  respectively 
pension and postretirement benefits the company records pension and other postretirement benefit costs in accordance with sfas no 
 employers accounting for pensions  and sfas no 
 employers accounting for postretirement benefits other than pensions 
under these accounting standards  assumptions are made regarding the valuation of benefit obligations and performance of plan assets 
delayed recognition of differences between actual results and those assumed is a required principle of these standards 
this approach allows for systematic recognition of changes in benefit obligations and plan performance over the working lives of the employees who benefit under the plans 
the following is a list of the primary assumptions  which are reviewed annually for the september measurement date 
discount rate the discount rate is used to record the value of benefits  which are based on future projections  in terms of today s dollars 
as of september   the discount rate was decreased from percent to percent 
expected return on plan assets roa the company projects the future roa based principally on prior performance and receives guidance from the company s actuaries 
the projected future value of assets reduces the benefit obligation a company will record 
as of september   the roa was reduced from percent to percent 
rate of compensation increase the company projects employees annual pay increases  which are used to project employees pension benefits at retirement 
as of september   the rate of compensation increase was changed from percent to percent 
health care cost trend the company projects expected increases in the cost of health care 
for measurement purposes  a percent and percent annual rate of increase in the per capita cost of covered health care benefits was assumed for fiscal  for pre and post claims costs  respectively 
amortization of gains losses the company can select the method by which gains or losses are recognized in financial results 
these gains or losses are created when actual results differ from estimated results based on the above assumptions 
the company recognizes these gains and losses ratably over a five year period 
page of a variance in the discount rate  expected return on plan assets  rate of compensation increase or amortization method could have a significant impact on the pension costs recorded under sfas no 
a variance in health care cost trend assumptions could have a significant impact on costs recorded under sfas no 
for postretirement medical expense 
the impact of a one percentage point increase or decrease in the assumed health care cost trend as calculated by the company s actuaries is million and million  respectively  as of december  the market value of pension plan assets has been affected by sharp declines in the capital markets 
as a result  the company anticipates increases in pension expense for of million  pension cost and cash funding requirements are expected to increase in future years and could become even more material without a substantial recovery in the capital markets 
see note to the consolidated financial statements 
income taxes in accordance with sfas no 
 accounting for income taxes sfas no 
 the company recognizes tax assets and liabilities for the cumulative effect of all temporary differences between financial statement carrying amounts and the tax basis of assets and liabilities 
investment tax credits associated with utility plant are deferred and amortized ratably to income over the lives of the related properties 
a valuation allowance is recorded to reduce the carrying amounts of deferred tax assets unless it is more likely than not that such assets will be realized

entitlement sales are transfers of the company s entitlement in a plant or generating facility in which it has a firm entitlement in  such as vermont yankee and hydro quebec 
in and the company transferred or sold specific mw entitlements of its share of vermont yankee including plant output and related capacity costs 
alliance sales are related to an alliance with virginia power that supplied wholesale power primarily in the northeast states

entitlement sales decrease of million due to the completion of a five year power contract that ended in october other resale sales decrease of million primarily due to lower iso new england market prices  offset by an percent increase in mwh sales for the same period 
the increased mwh sales are attributed to the end of the vermont yankee entitlement sale described below and an percent increase in the company s share of vermont yankee output beginning march   as a result of the early return of vermont yankee entitlements from the secondary purchasers 
the additional output that the company receives from the vermont yankee plant is either used to support own load needs or sold in the short term market mostly to iso new england 
although the vermont yankee plant was sold in july  the company receives approximately percent of the plant output through a purchased power agreement 
see power supply matters for more information regarding the vermont yankee sale 
other revenues increase of million primarily due to the sale of non firm transmission under the company s open access transmission tariff

operating revenues decreased approximately million as a result of the following factors retail sales increased million due to the favorable impact of a percent increase in retail rates beginning july   which contributed approximately million  and the favorable impact of customer mix and unit pricing  which contributed million 
offsetting these favorable impacts was a percent decrease in mwh sales resulting in a million reduction in retail sales revenue 
entitlement sales decreased million due in part to a five year power contract in which the company sold approximately percent of its share of vermont yankee output at full cost  the contract ended in october additionally  in and  the company entered into short term transactions in which it sold energy from vermont yankee based on a portion of its mw entitlement  and in return purchased energy from other nuclear plants based on the same mw 
offsetting purchases are included in the purchased power and produced energy mwh table below 
in  the sale part of the transactions of approximately million was included in other sales  while in the sale part of the transactions of approximately million was included in entitlement sales 
alliance sales decreased million due to termination of an alliance with virginia power 
other resale sales decreased million due to lower output and purchases from the company s power resources  which affected the amount of energy available for resale 
those reductions included the vermont yankee and millstone unit refueling outages in  lower hydro quebec firm energy contract purchases due to phase out of the contract  and lower hydro production from the company s owned facilities and fewer hydro purchases due to low rainfall 
offsetting this decrease were vermont yankee unit swap transactions  which were included in other in and entitlement in other revenues decreased million compared to primarily due to nonrecurring income in with no comparable items in in  other revenues included nonrecurring income of million for the reversal of the provision for rate refunds due to a favorable first circuit court of appeals decision allowing connecticut valley to recover all of its power costs in rates and a million ferc ordered refund of transmission costs from citizens utilities

the sale of vermont yankee effective july   resulted in a significant change to the company s purchased power cost structure when comparing with while the company continues to purchase a similar share of plant output  all payments are made on an energy mwh basis under a purchased power agreement ppa that became effective after the sale 
because of high ppa prices in  costs were significantly higher compared to continued ownership of the plant 
in anticipation of these increased costs the company sought and the vermont public service board psb approved an accounting order that authorized the page of company to defer incremental cost increases in resulting from the sale 
in vermont yankee purchases had a favorable impact on energy and capacity costs of approximately million compared to an unfavorable impact of approximately million if not for the accounting order 
the following is a summary of factors that impacted vermont yankee costs in compared to the company is no longer responsible for the plant s capacity costs and all purchases under the ppa are recorded as energy purchases 
prior to the sale  the great majority of vermont yankee costs were recorded as capacity costs 
in march  as a result of negotiations with secondary purchasers  the company s entitlement share of output from the plant increased by percent 
these additional purchases resulted in a million and million increase in capacity and energy costs  respectively  while supplying an additional  mwh to the company 
the company deferred approximately million in energy costs based on the approved accounting order resulting in a mitigation of million in energy costs 
the favorable impact of a million reduction of purchased power expense due to state tax benefits available to vermont yankee  resulting in a million decrease in capacity costs 
overall  the million increase in net purchased power and production fuel costs resulted from the following factors lower market prices for energy throughout much of reduced revenue used to offset the cost of power  resulting in million of additional net costs

capacity costs decreased million due to favorable items in including the june  rate order  which ended the hydro quebec power cost disallowances  resulting in a million reversal of a second quarter accrual for under recovery of power costs  and a million reversal of a december accrual for estimated costs for installed capacity in iso new england due to the resolution of a december ferc order 
additionally  vermont yankee capacity costs were lower by million  net of deferrals for refueling outage costs  due to lower decommissioning costs beginning july   and lower interest costs and operational efficiencies at the plant 
energy costs decreased million primarily due to alliance related purchases in of approximately million  which were offset by alliance resale sales 
other factors included decreased output by expensive ipp hydro units  decreased balancing purchases from iso new england  and a net deferral related to incremental costs of replacement power during nuclear refueling outages 
production fuel costs decreased million primarily due to lower output and costs related to the mcneil generating plant  which was operated at a higher capacity level in to support reliability  and lower output from the wyman generating station 
entitlement and other resale sales decreased approximately million primarily related to the alliance related sales and other factors as explained in operating revenues above

page of power suppy matters sources of energy the company purchases approximately percent of its power under several contracts of varying duration 
the company s purchased power portfolio includes a mix of base load and schedulable resources and additional wholly owned resources to help cover the company s peak load periods 
a breakdown of the company s energy sources is shown below nuclear generating companies canadian hydro contract company owned hydro jointly owned units independent power producers other the company s joint ownership interests include percent in unit of the millstone nuclear power station  percent in joseph c 
mcneil  a mw wood  gas and oil fired unit  and percent joint ownership in wyman  a mw oil fired unit 
wholly owned units include hydroelectric generating units  two oil fired and one diesel peaking unit with a combined nameplate capability of mw 
the company has long term power contracts with hydro quebec and with vermont yankee nuclear power corporation vynpc for a combined total of approximately percent of the company s total energy mwh purchases 
additionally  the company is required to purchase power from various independent power producers under long term contracts 
see power contract commitments below for more detail regarding these contracts 
the company also engages in short term purchases and sales with iso new england  and with other electric utilities primarily in new england  in order to minimize the net costs and risk of serving its customers 
based on present commitments and contracts  the company expects that net purchased power and production fuel costs will average approximately million to million per year for the years through  however  these costs are in large part dependent upon wholesale power market prices 
the company s long term power forecasts indicate a long position  or excess energy to meet load requirements  of approximately  mwh annually 
on a daily basis  the mwh excess is typically sold to iso new england with related sales revenue used to offset purchased power expenses 
in order to narrow the variance of its forecasted power position  the company entered into forward sale transactions averaging  mwh in power contract commitments hydro quebec the company is purchasing varying amounts of power from hydro quebec under the vermont joint owners vjo power contract through and related contracts negotiated between the company and hydro quebec  which in effect altered the terms and conditions contained in the original contract by reducing the overall power requirements and related costs 
there are specific contractual provisions that provide that in the event any vjo member fails to meet its obligation under the contract with hydro quebec  the remaining vjo participants  including the company  will step up to the defaulting party s share on a pro rata basis 
as of december   the company s obligation is approximately percent of the total vjo power contract through  which translates to approximately million  on a nominal basis  over the contract term 
the average annual amount of capacity that the company will purchase from january  through october  is mw  with lesser amounts purchased through october  in  the company purchased approximately million of energy and related capacity under the existing contracts with hydro quebec 
the company s estimated purchases under these contracts at a percent load factor are expected to be approximately million  million  million  million and million for the years through  respectively 
see note to the consolidated financial statements for further discussion of this contract 
page of vermont yankee on july   vynpc completed the sale of the vermont yankee nuclear power plant to entergy nuclear vermont yankee  llc entergy 
the sale transaction included a purchased power contract ppa with prices that generally range from cents to cents per kilowatt hour through  subject to a low market adjuster effective november  that protects the current vermont yankee owner utilities  including the company and its power consumers  in the event power market prices drop significantly 
if the market prices rise  however  contract prices are not adjusted upward 
the ppa is forecasted to result in higher purchased power costs in the initial years of the contract with decreased costs in future years when compared to continued ownership of the plant 
the company receives its percent entitlement of vermont yankee output sold by entergy to vynpc 
under the ppa between entergy and vynpc  vynpc pays entergy only for generation at fixed rates  vynpc in turn includes the ppa charges from entergy with certain residual costs of service through a ferc tariff to the company and the other vynpc sponsors 
accordingly  as a result of the sale  the company no longer bears the operating costs and risks associated with running the plant or the costs and risks associated with the eventual decommissioning of the plant 
in the company purchased approximately million of energy and capacity from vermont yankee  based on its entitlement share in the plant before and after the sale 
the company s estimated purchases related to vermont yankee are expected to be approximately million  million  million  million and million for the years through  respectively 
independent power producers ipps the company purchases power from a number of ipps who own qualifying facilities under the public utility regulatory policies act of these qualifying facilities produce energy using hydroelectric  biomass and refuse burning generation 
the majority of these purchases are made from a state appointed purchasing agent who purchases and redistributes the power to all vermont utilities 
in  the company received  mwh under these long term contracts  representing approximately percent and percent of the company s total mwh purchases and total purchased power expense for the period  respectively 
the total mwh received under these contracts includes  mwh allocated by the purchasing agent  vepp inc  and  mwh purchased by connecticut valley from a waste to energy electric generating facility owned by wheelabrator claremont company  lp the company s estimated purchases from ipps are expected to be approximately million  million  million  million and million for the years through  respectively 
see note and note to the consolidated financial statements for additional information regarding wheelabrator and contract negotiations with ipps  respectively 
wholly owned generating units the company owns and operates hydroelectric generating units  two gas turbines and one diesel peaking unit with a combined nameplate capability of mw 
the company is currently in the process of relicensing or preparing to relicense six separate hydroelectric projects under the federal power act 
these projects  some of which are grouped together under a single license  represent approximately mw  or about percent of the company s total hydroelectric nameplate capacity 
in the new licenses  the ferc is expected to impose conditions designed to address the impact of the projects on fish and other environmental concerns 
the company is unable to predict the specific impact of the imposition of such conditions  but capital expenditures and operating costs are expected to increase in the short term to meet these licensing obligations and net generation from these projects will decrease in future periods 
peterson dam the company has worked with environmental groups and the state of vermont since to develop a plan to relicense peterson dam  a mw hydroelectric station on the lamoille river 
the vermont natural resources council vnrc and others proposed removal of the facility  which produces power to energize approximately  homes per year 
in april  the parties including the town of milton and the dps entered into a conceptual agreement outlining a negotiated settlement of the issues relating to project relicensing  including the removal of peterson dam 
page of in january  the company  the state of vermont  vnrc and other parties reached an agreement to allow the company to relicense the four dams owned and operated by the company on the lamoille river 
according to the agreement  the company will receive a water quality certificate from the state  which is needed for the ferc to relicense the facilities for years 
the agreement also stipulates that the company must begin decommissioning peterson dam in approximately years 
the agreement  however  requires psb approval of full rate recovery related to decommissioning the peterson dam including full rate recovery of replacement power costs when the dam is out of service 
the company cannot predict the outcome of this matter 
nuclear decommissioning the company is responsible for paying its joint ownership percentage of millstone unit decommissioning costs and its entitlement percentages of decommissioning costs related to maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic the yankee companies 
millstone unit the company has a percent joint ownership interest in the millstone unit facility  in which dominion nuclear corporation dnc is the lead owner with approximately percent of the plant joint ownership 
the company is responsible for its joint ownership share of decommissioning costs 
the company s contributions to the millstone unit trust fund have ceased based on dnc s representation to various regulatory bodies that the trust fund  for its share of the plant  exceeded the nuclear regulatory commission s nrc minimum calculation required 
the company could choose to renew funding at its own discretion as long as the minimum requirement is met or exceeded 
in accordance with ratemaking treatment  the incremental costs attributable to replacement energy and maintenance costs  incurred during regular nuclear refueling outages  are deferred and amortized ratably to expense until the next regularly scheduled refueling outage  which is typically over months 
millstone unit had a scheduled refueling outage in early and another in september the company deferred approximately million for energy and maintenance costs related to the september refueling outage 
yankee companies the yankee companies have been permanently shut down and are currently conducting decommissioning activities 
each plant revises its revenue requirement forecasts on an ongoing basis  including estimates for decommissioning costs  based on site specific studies  through the projected completion date of all decommissioning activity 
based on revised estimates in  the costs of decommissioning maine yankee  connecticut yankee and yankee atomic increased by million  million and million  respectively  over prior estimates utilized at the ferc 
these increased costs are attributable mainly to increases in the projected costs of spent fuel storage  security and liability and property insurance 
the company s share of estimated future payments related to the decommissioning efforts based on current forecasts  including the incremental cost increases described above  are as follows dollars in millions date of study estimated obligation a revenue requirements b company share maine yankee connecticut yankee yankee atomic a 
represents estimated remaining decommissioning costs  for the period through for yankee atomic and through for maine yankee and connecticut yankee  in dollars 
b 
revenue requirements reflect the future payments required by the sponsor companies to recover estimated decommissioning and all other costs in nominal dollars  except for yankee atomic  which has collected all other costs except for the increased estimated decommissioning costs described above 
the company s share of estimated revenue requirements are reflected on the consolidated balance sheets as either regulatory assets or other deferred charges  depending on current recovery in existing rates  and nuclear decommissioning liabilities current and non current 
at december   the company had regulatory assets of approximately million and million related to maine yankee and connecticut yankee  respectively  and other deferred charges of million and million related to connecticut yankee and yankee atomic  respectively 
these amounts are subject to ongoing review and revisions and the company adjusts the associated regulatory assets  other deferred charges and nuclear decommissioning liabilities accordingly 
page of the decision to prematurely retire these nuclear power plants was based on economic analyses of the costs of operating them compared to the costs of closing them and incurring replacement power costs over the remaining period of the plants operating licenses 
the company believes that the premature retirements would have the effect of lowering costs to customers 
the company believes that based on the current regulatory process  its proportionate share of maine yankee s  connecticut yankee s and yankee atomic s decommissioning costs will be recovered through the regulatory process 
therefore  the ultimate resolution of the premature retirement of the three plants has not and should not have a material adverse effect on the company s earnings or financial condition 
maine yankee in  the maine yankee nuclear power plant was prematurely retired from commercial operation 
the company relied on maine yankee for less than percent of its required system capacity 
currently  costs billed to the company by maine yankee  including a provision for ultimate decommissioning of the plant are expected to be paid over the period through  and are being collected from the company s customers through existing retail and wholesale rate tariffs 
maine yankee s current billings to the sponsor companies are based on its most recent rate case settlement  approved by the ferc on june  the settlement provides for recovery of anticipated future payments for closing  decommissioning and recovery of the remaining investment in maine yankee and also resolved all issues raised in the ferc proceeding  including those raised by the secondary purchasers  who purchased maine yankee power through agreements with the original owners 
under the rate case settlement  maine yankee agreed to file with the ferc a rate proceeding with an effective date for new rates of no later than january  maine yankee is expected to seek recovery of the incremental cost increase described above in its next ferc rate filing

the company relied on yankee atomic for less than percent of its system capacity 
costs related to yankee atomic are not included in the company s existing rates due to yankee atomic s determination in july that it had collected sufficient funds to complete the decommissioning effort and discontinued related billings to the sponsor companies at that time 
changes to decommissioning cost estimates  however  are subject to ongoing review and such changes would require ferc review and approval

rates and regulation the company recognizes that adequate and timely rate relief is necessary if it is to maintain its financial strength  particularly since vermont regulatory rules do not allow for changes in purchased power and fuel costs to be automatically passed on to consumers through rate adjustment clauses 
the company intends to continue its practice of periodically reviewing costs and requesting rate increases when warranted 
the company currently plans  absent any unforeseen developments  to refrain from changing rates for its vermont utility customers until at least vermont retail rates retail rate case in an effort to mitigate eroding earnings and cash flow prospects  on november   the company filed with the psb a request for a percent rate increase  or million per annum  effective july  the psb suspended the rate filing and a schedule was set to review the case 
on june   the psb issued an order approving the company s may  rate case settlement with the dps 
the rate order ended uncertainty over the future recovery of hydro quebec contract costs  allowed a percent rate increase  made the january  temporary rates permanent  permitted a return on equity of percent  for the months ending june  for the vermont utility  and created new service quality standards

in july hydro quebec and the vjo agreed to a final settlement  of which the company s share was approximately million 
in the third quarter of  the company applied approximately million to the remaining balance of deferred ice storm arbitration costs 
on october   the company filed a letter with the psb summarizing its agreement with the dps on application of the remaining million to other regulatory assets 
on september  and in response to a psb request  the company filed its amended proposal as agreed to with the dps 
on october   the psb issued an order approving the company s proposal for reducing certain regulatory assets by approximately million through application of the remaining hydro quebec settlement and the ongoing millstone unit decommissioning non payments 
although the company is recovering the millstone unit decommissioning costs in rates  its payments for decommissioning have ceased 
in the third quarter of  based page of on the psb order  the company reduced certain of its regulatory assets related to conservation and load management by approximately million 
the company will account for the ongoing millstone unit decommissioning non payments as a regulatory liability  with carrying charges  to be addressed in the company s next rate proceeding 
in  the vermont utility earned approximately million  on an after tax basis  above its allowed rate of return of percent 
in accordance with its rate case settlement  the company reduced the vermont utility s earnings by that amount to satisfy its earnings cap requirement

connecticut valley sale on december   the company reached agreement for the sale of connecticut valley to public service company of new hampshire psnh  new hampshire s largest electric utility 
the sale agreement is the result of months of negotiations among connecticut valley  the company  the governor s office of energy and community services  staff of the nhpuc  the office of consumer advocate  the city of claremont and new hampshire legal assistance 
management believes the sale agreement  as structured  should resolve all issues in litigation over new hampshire s restructuring plan  connecticut valley s rates  recovery of stranded costs and renders moot a pending exit fee decision by the ferc 
the proposed closing date for the sale is january under the terms of the sale agreement  psnh will pay the company the book value for connecticut valley s franchise utility assets  which approximates million at december  psnh will acquire connecticut valley s poles  wires  substations and other facilities  as well as several independent power obligations  including the wheelabrator contract 
contemporaneously with the sale  psnh will pay an additional million to the company as a stranded cost reimbursement for the power resources the company acquired to serve connecticut valley s customers 
the ferc  the nhpuc and possibly the sec must approve the sale 
in addition  as a condition of the sale  the nhpuc must approve the pending settlement in the wheelabrator docket 
the sale will result in either a gain or loss  however  the nature and size of such gain or loss will be highly dependent upon power market price forecasts at the time of the sale and mitigation efforts both before and after the sale 
accordingly  the company cannot estimate at this time such a gain or loss 
if the sale transaction does not close  and if there is an adverse resolution of the pending ferc exit fee proceeding  these events would have a material adverse effect on the company s results of operations  financial condition and cash flows 
however  the company cannot predict the ultimate outcome of this matter 
ferc exit fee proceeding s on february   connecticut valley was directed by the nhpuc to terminate its purchase of power from the company 
the company filed an application with the ferc in june  to recover stranded costs in connection with its wholesale rate schedule with connecticut valley and the notice of cancellation of that rate schedule contingent upon the recovery of the stranded costs that would result from the cancellation of that rate schedule 
in december  the ferc rejected the company s proposal to recover stranded costs through the imposition of a surcharge in the company s transmission tariff  but indicated that it would consider an exit fee mechanism in the wholesale rate schedule for collecting stranded costs 
the ferc denied the page of company s motion for a rehearing regarding the transmission surcharge proposal 
however  the company filed a request with the ferc for an exit fee mechanism in the wholesale rate schedule to collect the stranded costs resulting from the cancellation of the wholesale rate schedule 
the stranded cost obligation sought to be recovered was million in nominal dollars and million on a net present value basis as of december  on april   a ferc administrative law judge alj issued an initial decision in the company s stranded cost exit fee proceeding 
the alj ruled that if connecticut valley terminates its relationship as a wholesale customer of the company and subsequently becomes a wholesale transmission customer of the company  connecticut valley shall be liable for payment of stranded costs to the company 
the alj calculated  on an illustrative pro forma basis  a nominal stranded cost obligation of nearly million through the amount of the exit fee as determined by the alj will decrease with each year that service continues and normal tariff revenues are collected  and will ultimately be calculated from the date of termination  if notice of termination is ever given 
on october   the company  jointly with the nhpuc  requested that the ferc defer issuance of its final exit fee order to allow for connecticut valley to continue working for a negotiated settlement with parties to the new hampshire restructuring proceeding and the nhpuc 
on december   connecticut valley  the state of new hampshire  the city of claremont and psnh reached agreement for the sale of connecticut valley to psnh 
under the terms of the agreement  which is described in more detail above  psnh will pay an additional million to the company as a stranded cost reimbursement for the power resources the company acquired to serve connecticut valley s customers  thus rendering moot the exit fee decision by the ferc 
absent the sale  if the company was unable to obtain approval by the ferc of an exit fee from its power supply arrangement and connecticut valley was forced to terminate its relationship as a wholesale customer of the company the earliest termination date that could presently occur pursuant to the wholesale rate schedule is december  it is possible that the company would be required to recognize a pre tax loss under the power supply arrangement totaling approximately million as of december  the company would also be required to write off approximately million pre tax of regulatory assets associated with its wholesale business as of december  the sale of connecticut valley to psnh as currently structured  which includes the receipt of million in stranded cost recovery  is expected to resolve these issues 
however  management cannot predict whether the sale will occur under these terms 
wheelabrator power contrac t connecticut valley purchases power from several independent power producers  who own qualifying facilities as defined by the public utility regulatory policies act of for the twelve months ended december   under long term contracts with these qualifying facilities  connecticut valley purchased  mwh  of which percent was purchased from wheelabrator claremont company  lp  wheelabrator who owns a waste to energy electric generating facility 
connecticut valley had filed a complaint with the ferc stating its concern that wheelabrator has not been a qualifying facility since the facility began operation 
on february   the ferc issued an order denying connecticut valley s request for a refund of past purchased power costs and lower future costs 
connecticut valley filed a request for rehearing with the ferc on march   which was denied 
connecticut valley appealed to the dc circuit court of appeals  which denied the appea l  but indicated that connecticut valley could seek relief from the nhpuc 
on may   connecticut valley filed a petition with the nhpuc seeking to amend the contract to permit purchase of net  rather than gross  output of the facility and a refund  with interest  of past purchases of the difference between net and gross output 
on march   the nhpuc issued an order denying connecticut valley s petition 
the nhpuc further found that its original order did not authorize sales in excess of mw and ordered that connecticut valley discontinue purchases in excess of that amount at preferential rates 
wheelabrator has been making sales at the long term rates for up to mw of capacity and related energy since it began operations in on april   connecticut valley  wheelabrator  nhpuc staff and the office of consumer advocate submitted a stipulation of settlement with the nhpuc that requires wheelabrator to make five annual payments of  and a sixth payment of  and connecticut valley to make six annual payments of  all of which will be credited to customer bills 
the stipulation of settlement will not become effective unless and until it is approved by the nhpuc 
the settlement does not otherwise change the terms of the existing contract between connecticut valley and wheelabrator 
page of a hearing on the stipulation of settlement was held on june  with a focus on determining whether the stipulation is in the public interest 
the nhpuc issued an order on july   in which it did not rule on the stipulation of settlement and instead announced that it would appoint an independent mediator to work with all parties to see if a mutually agreeable settlement of the case could be achieved 
the nhpuc selected an independent mediator and  after several mediation sessions  the mediator issued a report on december   which stated that the parties opposing the stipulation of settlement before the mediation continued to oppose it after the mediation 
as a condition to the sale of connecticut valley to psnh  the nhpuc must approve the stipulation of settlement 
additionally  under the terms of the sale agreement  psnh will acquire several of connecticut valley s independent power obligations  including the wheelabrator contract 
electric industry restructuring the electric utility industry is in a period of transition that in some cases has resulted in a shift away from ratemaking based on cost of service and return on equity to more market based rates with energy sold to customers by competing retail energy service providers 
many states  including new hampshire  where the company does business  have implemented new mechanisms to bring greater competition  customer choice and market influence to the industry while retaining the public benefits associated with the current regulatory system 
during  however  the pace of transition slowed due primarily to public and governmental reactions to issues associated with deregulation efforts in california and the collapse of its wholesale electricity market 
vermont there have been three primary sources of vermont governmental activity attempting to restructure the electric industry in vermont the governor s working group  created by the former governor of vermont  which completed its work in  the psb s docket no 
through which the psb considered proposals to restructure committed utility power supply arrangements  and the psb s docket no 
 through which the psb considered the establishment of policies and procedures to govern retail competition within the company s service territory 
at this time  the psb has concluded its investigation into the restructuring of committed power supply arrangements in docket no 
and the proceeding has been closed 
additionally  in december  the psb issued an order closing docket no 
as a result  the company cannot determine when or if retail competition will be introduced within the company s vermont service territory 
regional transmission organizations pursuant to ferc order no 
issued april the company operates its transmission system under an open access  nondiscriminatory transmission tariff 
in  the ferc issued a notice of proposed rulemaking nopr that would amend ferc s regulations under the federal power act to facilitate the formation of regional transmission organizations rto 
in late the ferc issued order no 
 regarding the formation of rtos 
the company has participated in various filings and proceedings related to formation of rtos since order no 
was first issued 
more recently  on november   nepool notified the ferc that it was withdrawing the proposal made with new york to form the northeast rto and  subsequently  announced that it would propose an rto for new england 
it is anticipated that this filing will be made mid year transmission owning entities in new england  including vermont electric power company  inc velco and the company  are participating in discussions intended to result in a transmission network company to provide the transmission services needed under the ferc s rto order 
order no 
is generally designed to separate the governance and operation of the transmission system from generation companies and other market participants 
at this time  the company is unable to predict the outcome of this matter or its impact on the company 
standard market design on july   ferc issued a nopr for standard market design smd 
ferc intends to establish nationally consistent power market rules and offers additional options for rto formation 
on september   the ferc accepted in part iso new england s request to implement an smd governing wholesale energy sales in new england 
the smd will include a system of locational marginal pricing of energy under which prices for load will be determined by zone and based in part on transmission congestion and marginal losses experienced in each zone 
previous to smd the costs of network congestion and losses were spread across the region s load serving entities on a pro rata basis 
based on data observed during indicative trials beginning in the fall of  congestion appears to be most significant in the load centers of eastern massachusetts and southwestern connecticut  while losses may be high in vermont 
initially  the state of vermont is expected to comprise a single page of load zone under the plan 
generators will receive location specific prices for the nodes at which they interconnect with the new england electric network 
the vast majority of the company s generating resources are either located in the vermont zone or delivered at locations that are not expected to congest significantly in or en route to the vermont zone under expected circumstances 
because of their magnitude  congestion and loss costs are the two categories of power related costs that have the greatest potential to increase or decrease the net cost of serving load relative to the pre smd environment 
an auction based system of financial transmission rights ftr will be implemented to allow participants to hedge congestion risks 
an associated auction revenue allocation scheme will be implemented to distribute the proceeds of the ftr auction to load entities that experience congestion and entities that invest to increase the capacity of the regional network 
smd will also include the creation of a location specific day ahead market that will allow participants the opportunity to settle transactions involving load and generation one day in advance of the real time spot market 
in general  the company either owns or holds entitlements to generation that will be self scheduled in the day ahead market and  therefore  anticipates making use of that market to clear the majority of its load and generation 
the company expects that its remaining dispatchable resources and residual load will settle in the real time market 
the overall price level and volatility of these new markets cannot be determined at this time  however  the company expects to employ available risk mitigation mechanisms and its largely firm priced sources to limit the effects 
administrative fees applied by the iso to transactions are also being changed to reflect greater costs of smd 
the company believes that in total the administrative costs of smd will be greater than prior market configurations 
separately  the company  through vynpc  is engaged in discussions with entergy  which owns the vermont yankee plant  over transaction settlement procedures  allocation of transaction costs and volumetric measures charges under the smd 
operating reserve requirements are also changing and  in general  the company expects the new requirements are likely to somewhat raise costs relative to the system operating reserve requirements in place prior to smd 
iso new england has also increased the financial assurance requirement for all entities participating in the market based upon each entity s credit rating and current net position 
the company anticipates that additional credit related costs  relative to the pre smd market  are likely to be incurred in order to satisfy this requirement 
the rules requiring load serving entities to hold generating capacity based upon peak demands in the region are also being revamped 
going forward  this responsibility will be determined by each entity s share of the new england peak load over a trailing annual period 
in general  the region tends to experience its peaks in summer months while the company s maximum loads tend to occur in the months of december and january 
the capacity credit received for generation is also being modified to further account for the observed operating performance of the specific sources 
in general  the company believes that its resources demonstrate operating reliability that is relatively favorable to the population of generators in the region 
on february   iso new england announced that smd would become operational on march  iso new england is also working with the region s stakeholders to propose to the ferc a new cost allocation rule that will be used to determine who will pay the costs of upgrades to the regional transmission network once smd has been implemented 
velco has a number of network upgrades in the planning stage and the net cost to the company of any such new investments will be affected by cost allocation rulings by the ferc 
at this time  the company is unsure as to the outcome of these matters or the potential affects on the company 
competition risk factors utility if retail competition is implemented in vermont or in connecticut valley s new hampshire service territory  the company is unable to predict the impact on its revenues  the company s ability to retain existing customers with respect to their power supply purchases and attract new customers or the margins that will be realized on retail sales of electricity  if any such sales are sought 
the company expects its power distribution and transmission service to its customers to continue on an exclusive basis subject to continuing economic regulation 
page of historically  electric utility rates in vermont and new hampshire have been based on a utility s costs 
as a result  electric utilities are subject to certain accounting standards that are not applicable to other business enterprises 
sfas no 
requires regulated entities  in appropriate circumstances  to establish regulatory assets and liabilities  and thereby defer the income statement impact of certain costs and revenues that are expected to be realized in future rates 
the company believes it currently complies with the provisions of sfas no 
for both its regulated vermont and new hampshire service territory and ferc regulated wholesale businesses 
also see note to the consolidated financial statements and critical accounting polices  above 
interest rate risk as of december   the company has million of industrial development pollution control bonds outstanding  of which million have an interest rate that floats monthly and million floats every five years with the short term credit markets 
all other utility debt has a fixed rate 
there are no interest lock or swap agreements in place 
the company has million of consolidated temporary cash investments as of december   including million of non utility temporary cash investments  of which million is related to catamount 
also see non utility risk factors below 
interest rate changes could also affect calculations affecting estimated pension and other benefit liabilities  thereby affecting pension and other benefit expenses and potentially requiring contributions to the trusts 
equity market risk as of december   the company s pension trust holds marketable equity securities in the amount of million and its share of the millstone unit decommissioning trust  in the amount of million 
the company also maintains a variety of insurance policies in a rabbi trust  with a current value in the amount of million  as of december   to support various supplemental retirement and deferred compensation plans 
the current values of certain of these policies are affected by changes in the equity market 
therefore  changes in the equity market could affect pension expense as well as the millstone unit decommissioning fund and the rabbi trust asset balances 
credit risk the company has million of letters of credit  supporting three series of tax exempt pollution control industrial development bonds  totaling million  of which the earliest series matures in these letters of credit expire on august  and need to be renewed 
without the support of the letters of credit  the bonds could become due 
the company has million of first mortgage bonds maturing in the next five years and million of second mortgage bonds that mature on august  it is currently anticipated that all  or a majority of  the debt will be refinanced at maturity 
the type  timing and terms of future financing that the company may need will depend upon its cash needs  the availability of refinancing sources and the prevailing conditions in the financial markets 
the covenants covering the company s second mortgage bonds contain limiting restrictions if those bonds receive a debt rating below bbb from rating agencies 
the current ratings of the bonds from both fitch and standard poor s are bbb stable 
the limiting characteristics include certain restrictions on investments in non regulated subsidiaries  the incurrence of indebtedness and the payment of dividends 
restrictions are dependent on meeting both a fixed charge coverage and a cumulative cash flow test 
at december   both tests indicate current levels are acceptable 
inflation the annual rate of inflation  as measured by the consumer price index  was percent for  percent for and percent for the company s revenues  however  are based on rate regulation that generally recognizes only historical costs 
inflation therefore continues to have an impact on most aspects of the business 
non utility in  catamount undertook a comprehensive strategic review of its operations 
as a result  catamount has refocused its efforts from being an investor in late stage renewable energy to being primarily focused on developing  owning and operating wind energy projects 
catamount s future success is dependent on the acceptance of wind power as an energy source by large producers  utilities  and other purchasers of electricity 
historically  the wind energy industry had a reputation for numerous problems relating to the failure of many wind power generating facilities developed in the early s to perform acceptably 
in addition  many potential page of customers believe that wind energy is an unpredictable and inconsistent resource  is uneconomic compared to other sources of power and does not produce stable voltage and frequency 
although catamount believes that these concerns may be adequately addressed in the near term  there is no guarantee of wind power acceptance by potential customers as an energy source 
dependence on governmental policies the wind energy industry is highly dependent upon governmental policies and laws enacted to stimulate growth of clean renewable energy through tax credits and other incentive plans  including mandatory purchasing requirements by local utilities of renewable energy  including wind energy 
while the trend worldwide is to increase the use of renewable energy sources  there is no assurance that any particular governmental policy or tax credit or incentive program will be continued in any jurisdiction where catamount conducts business
