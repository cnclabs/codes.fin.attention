item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations critical accounting policies financial reporting release no 
 which was issued by the securities and exchange commission sec  requires all registrants to discuss critical accounting policies or methods used in the preparation of financial statements 
note to the consolidated financial statements includes a summary of the significant accounting policies and methods in preparation of the company s consolidated financial statements 
the preparation of financial statements includes the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and the reported amounts of net revenues and expenses during the reporting periods 
the following is a review of the more significant assumptions and estimates  as well as the accounting policies and methods used in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements 
receivables acquired for investment 
in connection with loans that were acquired in a portfolio purchase by the partnership  the company estimates the amount and timing of undiscounted expected future principal and interest cash flows 
for certain purchased loans  the amount paid for a loan reflects the company s determination that it is probable the company will be unable to collect all amounts due according to the loan s contractual terms 
accordingly  at acquisition  the company recognizes the excess of the loan s scheduled contractual principal and contractual interest payments over its expected cash flows as an amount that should not be accreted 
the remaining amount  representing the excess of the loan s expected cash flows over the amount paid  is accreted into interest income over the remaining life of the loan 
assets are reported for the entire partnership and the partner s share of income is reported as minority interest 
see note acquisition facility 
over the life of the loan  the company continues to estimate expected cash flows on a pool by pool basis 
the company evaluates whether the present value of any decrease in the loan s actual or expected cash flows should be recorded as a loss provision for the loan 
for any material increases in estimated cash flows  the company adjusts the amount of accretable yield by reclassification from nonaccretable difference 
the company then adjusts the amount of periodic accretion over the loan s remaining life 
see note income recognition 
for receivables held for investment  the company accrues interest income monthly based upon contractual terms using the effective interest method 
interest income also includes additional amounts received upon early payoffs of certain receivables attributable to the difference between the principal balance of the receivables calculated using the rule of s method and the principal balance of the receivables calculated using the effective interest method 
when a receivable becomes days past due  income accrual is suspended until the payments become current 
when a loan is charged off or the collateral is repossessed  the remaining income accrual is written off 
other income includes late charge fees and is recognized as collected 
servicing income is accrued as it is earned and intercompany amounts are eliminated upon consolidation 
allowance for credit losses 
for receivables financed under the firc credit facility  the company purchases credit enhancement insurance from third party insurers which covers the risk of loss upon default and certain other risks 
the company established a captive insurance subsidiary to reinsure the credit enhancement insurance coverage 
the credit enhancement insurance coverage for all receivables acquired in march and thereafter has been reinsured by fiic 
beginning in october  all receivables recorded by the company were covered by credit enhancement insurance while pledged as collateral for the firc credit facility 
once receivables are transferred to the fiarc commercial paper facility  credit enhancement insurance is cancelled 
in addition  no default insurance is purchased for core receivables originated and financed under the fiacc commercial paper facility 
accordingly  the company is exposed to credit losses for all receivables either reinsured by fiic or uninsured and provides an allowance for such losses 
efforts to make customer contact generally begin when the customer is three days past due and become more aggressive as the loan becomes further past due 
management reviews past due loans and considers various factors including payment history  job status and any events that may have occurred that prevent the customer from making a payment 
through the evaluation  if it is determined that the loan is uncollectible  the collateral is repossessed 
generally this occurs at to days past due 
upon repossession  an impairment is recorded to write off receivables held for investment and record the fair value as assets held for sale 
fair value is determined by estimating the proceeds of the collateral which primarily are comprised of auction proceeds on the sale of the automobile less selling related expenses 
after collection of all proceeds  the company realizes an adjustment  positive or negative  based on the difference between the fair value estimate and the true proceeds received 
in the event the collateral is unable to be located  the company will write off the entire balance after exhausting all collection efforts 
the company calculates the allowance for credit losses in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
sfas  accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan does not apply to the company since the receivables held for investment are comprised of a large group of smaller balance homogenous loans that are evaluated collectively for impairment 
the company applies a systematic methodology in order to determine the amount of the allowance for credit losses 
the specific methodology utilized is a six month migration analysis whereby the company compares the aging status of each loan from six months prior to the aging loan status as of the reporting date 
these factors are then applied to the aging status of each loan at the reporting date in order to calculate the number of loans that are expected to migrate to impaired status 
the estimated number of impairments is then multiplied by estimated loss per loan  which is based on historical information 
the computed reserve is then compared to the amount recorded for adequacy 
the company compares the six month result to prior six month periods to compare trends and evaluate any other internal or external factors that may affect collectibility 
the allowance for credit losses is based on estimates and qualitative evaluations and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed periodically and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  are reported in earnings in the period they become known 
deferred financing costs 
the company defers financing costs and amortizes the costs related to the respective warehouse credit facilities and term notes over the estimated average life of the receivables financed under those respective facilities as the provisions of such facility generally provide that receivables assigned to such facility would be allowed to amortize should the facilities not be extended 
deferred financing costs are expensed proportionately if borrowing capacity is reduced 
derivatives 
in june  the financial accounting standards board fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for derivative instruments and hedging activities 
sfas no 
establishes accounting and reporting standards requiring that every derivative instrument including certain derivative instruments embedded in other contracts be recorded in the balance sheet as either an asset or liability at its fair value 
the statement requires that changes in the derivative s fair value be recognized currently in earnings unless specific hedge accounting criteria are met 
in june  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain derivative instruments and certain hedging activities an amendment of fasb statement no 
as of may  the company designated its interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap with an aggregate notional value of  as cash flow hedges as defined under sfas no 
accordingly  any changes in the fair value of these instruments resulting from the mark to market process are recorded as unrealized gains or losses and reflected as an increase or reduction in shareholders equity through other accumulated comprehensive income loss 
in connection with the decision to enter into the million floating rate swap on june   the company elected to change the designation of the million fixed rate swap and not account for the instrument as a hedge under sfas no 
as a result  the change in fair value of the swaps is reflected in net earnings for the period subsequent to may  the interest rate caps entered into as a requirement of the fiarc commercial paper facility are not designated as hedges and  accordingly  changes in the fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses and reflected in net earnings 
hedge accounting was not adopted for these positions due to mark to market movements being deemed ineffective since they relate to time value and would be required to flow through net earnings thus eliminating any benefits of hedge accounting

the increase in net income is primarily related to a  loss or  net of minority interest  in fiscal year on the receivables acquired for investment due to an increase in the projected loss rates 
additionally  during  the company amortized deferred financing costs and warrants of  related to restructuring of debt facilities 
in fiscal year  the company experienced lower net interest margin due to a lower average outstanding portfolio and lower rates and also experienced higher credit losses 
these decreases were offset by higher fee income

analysis of net interest income net interest income is the difference between interest earned from the receivables portfolio and interest expense incurred on the credit facilities used to acquire the receivables 
net interest income was million in  a decrease of percent when compared to amounts reported in and a decrease of percent when compared to amounts reported in the amount of net interest income is the result of the relationship between the average principal amount of receivables held and average rate earned thereon and the average principal amount of debt incurred to finance such receivables and the average rates paid thereon 
changes in the principal amount and rate components associated with the receivables and debt can be segregated to analyze the periodic changes in net interest income

provision for credit losses 
the provision for credit losses for increased by  or percent  over the provision is affected by a the amount of net charge offs and b changes in the portfolio size 
net charge offs increased from  in fiscal to  in fiscal due to an increase in the frequency of repossessions and lower recovery rates from the sales of repossessed vehicles 
the higher frequency is directly related to the weakened economic conditions and the resulting inability of certain customers to maintain comparable employment 
lower recovery rates on repossessions are due to an increase in supply of used vehicles and increased incentives for new vehicles which decreased the demand and price for used vehicles 
contributing to the increase in charge offs was the provision impact of a growing portfolio 
based primarily on historical loss experience of various aging categories  the company provides a reserve equal to of the outstanding principal balance of receivables held for investment 
since the average portfolio size decreased during fiscal and increased in  a higher provision expense was incurred for loss on receivables acquired for investment 
during fiscal year  a loss of  was recorded on the receivables acquired for investment 
these assets are comprised of loans previously originated by auto lenders acceptance corporation and include a portfolio of warehouse loans and a portfolio of loans that were previously securitized 
the securitized loans were subsequently redeemed and funded through the fiacc credit facility

the gross servicing fee income of  relates to the income earned on these pools 
unrealized loss on interest rate derivative positions 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas  the company is required to report the fair value of interest rate derivative positions 
unrealized losses of for fiscal year principally are due to negative mark to market movements due to the declining interest rate environment on interest rate caps required for the fiarc credit facility 
for fiscal year  the company purchased both sides of the interest rate caps through separate subsidiaries and thus market movements offset 
the remaining unrealized losses are due to movements in the million pay fixed swap versus movements in the million pay floating swap 
these two derivatives will not directly offset over the remaining term due to interest rate fluctuations between periods 
salaries and benefit expenses 
salaries and benefit costs decreased to  in from  in the decrease is primarily due to reduced headcount needs related to lower average portfolio and outsourcing a portion of collections to a third party service 
salaries and benefits did increase in the fourth quarter of fiscal due to the addition of two servicing portfolios 
other interest expense

based primarily on historical loss experience of various aging categories  the company provides a reserve equal to of the outstanding principal balance of receivables held for investment 
since the average portfolio size has decreased during fiscal  a lower provision expense was incurred 
lastly  in fiscal  the provision expense increased from 
to of outstanding principal balance of receivables held for investment or the increase was made in light of the slowdown in economic growth and softness in the employment rate 
this increased the provision expense in and also contributed an offsetting effect to the higher charge offs when comparing total expense to loss on receivables acquired for investment and trust certificates 
the loss in fiscal year increased to  from for fiscal during the third quarter of fiscal a loss of  was recorded on the receivables acquired for investment and investment in trust certificates 
these assets are comprised of loans previously originated by auto lenders acceptance corporation and include a portfolio of warehouse loans and a portfolio of loans that were previously securitized

one securitization was called september  and the other was called march   when the underlying receivables were repurchased 
subsequent to the call date  no further servicing income is earned 
late fees and other income 
late fees and other income primarily represents late fees collected from customers on past due accounts  collections on certain fisc assets which had previously been charged off by the company  and interest income earned on short term marketable securities and money market instruments 
late fees and other income decreased to  in from  in or a decrease 
the decrease is primarily due to lower reinvestment rates earned on restricted cash balances 
in addition to the declining reinvestment rates  the reinvestment income was also negatively impacted by the smaller portfolio 
unrealized loss on interest rate derivative positions 
in conjunction with the adoption of sfas  the company is required to report the fair value of interest rate derivative positions 
unrealized losses are primarily related to mark to market movements in the million pay fixed swap versus movements in the million pay floating swap 
these two derivatives will not directly offset over the remaining term due to interest rate fluctuations between periods 
salaries and benefit expenses 
salaries and benefit costs decreased to  in from  in the decrease is primarily due to reduced headcount needs related to lower originations and a lower managed portfolio 
other interest expense

other expenses 
other expenses decreased or percent in fiscal primarily due to decreases in telephone expense and lease expense of and  respectively  offset by increases in depreciation and amortization of and third party service bureau fees of telephone expense decreased from to due to lower long distance rates and a smaller portfolio 
lease expense decreased primarily due to the completion of an operating lease in amortization increased due to amortization of deferred financing costs and stock warrants related to the term loan working capital facility restructured with bank of america on december  amortization of these fees and warrants were higher in compared to included in this increase is of amortization related to the termination of the term loan working capital facility with bank of america on december  a new term loan facility with first union national bank was entered into on december  in order to refinance the outstanding borrowings and increase the size of the facility 
depreciation decreased by in compared to related to a write off of capitalized software in and the completion of a capital lease amortization in mid in december in order to increase the stability of operations  the company migrated to a third party service bureau which became the primary system for collecting and servicing the managed loan portfolio 
after conversion and testing  the company abandoned the use of internal software and expensed of unamortized amounts 
additionally  in november  the company completed the amortization of a capital lease used to acquire assets in conjunction with the purchase of fisc 
consequently  expenses for were less than as related to the capital lease 
third party service bureau fees increased as the company began using the third party provider in december  thus only five months of expenses were incurred in compared to a full year for income before provision for income taxes and minority interest 
during  income before provision for income taxes and minority interest decreased by  or percent from as a result of the factors discussed above 
liquidity and capital resources sources and uses of cash flows 
the company s business requires significant cash flow to support its operating activities 
the principal cash requirements include i amounts necessary to acquire receivables from dealers and fund required reserve accounts  ii amounts necessary to fund premiums for credit enhancement insurance or other credit enhancement required by the company s financing programs  and iii amounts necessary to fund costs to retain receivables  primarily interest expense 
the company also requires a significant amount of cash flow for working capital to fund fixed operating expenses  primarily salaries and benefits 
the company s most significant cash flow requirement is the acquisition of receivables 
the company paid million for receivables acquired to be held for investment for compared to million in the company funds the purchase price of receivables through a combination of two warehouse facilities 
the firc credit facility generally permits the company to borrow up to the outstanding principal balance of qualified receivables  but not to exceed million 
receivables that have accumulated in the firc credit facility may be transferred to the fiarc commercial paper facility at the option of the company 
the fiarc commercial paper facility provides an additional financing source up to million 
additionally  the company has transferred receivables from the warehouse credit facilities and issued term notes 
substantially all of the company s receivables are pledged to collateralize these credit facilities and term notes 
the company s most significant source of cash flow is the principal and interest payments received from the receivables portfolios 
the company received such payments in the amount of million in and million in such cash flow funds repayment of amounts borrowed under the firc credit and commercial paper facilities and other holding costs  primarily interest expense and servicing and custodial fees 
during the fiscal year  the company required net cash of million as the receivable purchases exceeded the portfolio collections 
during the fiscal year  the company s collections on receivables held for investment exceeded cash required to purchase receivables held for investment by million 
the company has relied on borrowed funds to provide the source of cash flow in periods of growth 
as of april   the company has million of available capacity in the warehouse credit facilities to fund future growth 
in addition to the excess cash flow generated from the principal and interest collections on the receivables portfolio  the company collects servicing fees funded from each of the credit facilities 
servicing fees range from to of the outstanding principal balance of the loans 
excess cash flows and servicing fees are received after month end but relate to the prior month activity 
thus upon filing of the monthly servicing statements  a portion of the restricted cash is converted to cash available to fund operations 
at april  and  the company s unencumbered cash was  and  respectively 
excess cash and servicing fees collected after month end but related to the prior month activity totaled  and  as of april  and  respectively 
the increase in available cash is primarily due to an increasing managed portfolio s effect on excess cash and servicing fees 
management believes the unencumbered cash and cash inflows are adequate to fund cash requirements for operations 
capitalization 
the company has financed its acquisition of such receivables primarily through these types of credit facilities since the company s equity was not a significant factor in its capitalization until the completion of the company s initial public offering of common stock in october  resulting in net proceeds of million 
however  the company expects to continue to rely primarily on its credit facilities and the issuance of secured term notes to acquire and retain receivables 
the company believes its existing credit facilities have adequate capacity to fund the increase of the receivables portfolio expected in the foreseeable future 
while the company has no reason to believe that these facilities will not continue to be available  their termination could have a material adverse effect on the company s operations if substitute financing on comparable terms was not obtained 
financing arrangements the company finances the acquisition of its receivables portfolio through two warehouse credit facilities 
the company s credit facilities provide for one year terms and have been renewed annually 
management of the company believes that the credit facilities will continue to be renewed or extended or that it would be able to secure alternate financing on satisfactory terms  however  there can be no assurance that it will be able to do so 
in january and january  the company issued million and million  respectively  in asset backed notes term notes secured by discrete pools of receivables 
proceeds from the two note issuances were used to repay outstanding borrowings under the various revolving credit facilities 
substantially all receivables retained by the company are pledged as collateral for the credit facilities and the term notes 
the weighted average interest rate for the company s secured borrowings including the effect of program fees  dealer fees  and other comprehensive income loss amortization was and for the fiscal years ending april  and  respectively

the facility lenders are named as additional insureds under these policies 
the coverages are obtained on each receivable at the time it is purchased by the company and the applicable premiums are prepaid for the life of the receivable 
each receivable is covered by three separate credit insurance policies  consisting of basic default insurance under a standard auto loan protection policy known as alpi insurance together with certain supplemental coverages relating to physical damage and other risks 
solely at its expense  the company carries these coverages and neither the vehicle purchasers nor the dealers are charged for the coverages and they are usually unaware of their existence 
the company s alpi insurance policy is written by national union fire insurance company of pittsburgh national union  which is a wholly owned subsidiary of american international group 
as of april  national union had been assigned a rating of a by am best company  inc the premiums that the company paid during its past fiscal year for its three credit enhancement insurance coverages  of which the largest component is the basic alpi insurance  represented approximately percent of the principal amount of the receivables acquired during the year 
aggregate premiums paid for alpi coverage alone during the fiscal years ended april   and were   and  respectively  and accounted for percent  percent and percent of the aggregate principal balance of the receivables acquired during such respective periods 
prior to establishing its relationship with national union in march  the company s alpi policy was provided by another third party insurer 
in april the company organized first investors insurance company the insurance subsidiary under the captive insurance company laws of the state of vermont 
the insurance subsidiary is an indirect wholly owned subsidiary of the company and is a party to a reinsurance agreement whereby the insurance subsidiary reinsures percent of the risk under the company s alpi insurance policy 
at the time each receivable is insured by national union  the risk is automatically reinsured to its full extent and approximately percent of the premium paid by the company to national union with respect to such receivable is ceded to the insurance subsidiary 
when a loss covered by the alpi policy occurs  national union pays it after the claim is processed  and national union is then reimbursed in full by the insurance subsidiary 
as of april   gross premiums had been ceded to the insurance subsidiary since its inception by national union in the amount of  andthe insurance subsidiary reimbursed national union for aggregate reinsurance claims in the amount of  in addition to the monthly premiums and liquidity reserves of the insurance subsidiary  a trust account is maintained by national union to secure the insurance subsidiary s obligations for losses it has reinsured 
the result of the foregoing reinsurance structure is that national union  as the fronting insurer under the captive arrangement  is unconditionally obligated to the company s credit facility lenders for all losses covered by the alpi policy  and the company  through its insurance subsidiary  is obligated to indemnify national union for all such losses 
as of april   the insurance subsidiary had capital and surplus of  and unencumbered cash reserves of  in addition to the  trust account 
the alpi coverage as well as the insurance subsidiary s liability under the reinsurance agreement  remains in effect for each receivable that is pledged as collateral under the warehouse credit facility 
once receivables are transferred from firc to fiarc and financed under the commercial paper facility  alpi coverage and the insurance subsidiary s liability under the reinsurance agreement is cancelled with respect to the transferred receivables 
any unearned premium associated with the transferred receivables is returned to the company 
the company believes the losses its insurance subsidiary will be required to indemnify will be less than the premiums ceded to it

acquisition facility 
on october   the company  through its indirect  wholly owned subsidiary  fifs acquisition funding company llc fifs acquisition  entered into a million non recourse bridge financing facility with vfcc  an affiliate of wachovia securities  to finance the company s acquisition of fisc 
contemporaneously with the company s purchase of fisc  fisc transferred certain assets to fifs acquisition  consisting primarily of i all receivables owned by fisc as of the acquisition date  ii fisc s ownership interest in certain trust certificates and subordinated spread or cash reserve accounts related to two asset securitizations previously conducted by fisc  and iii certain other financial assets  including charged off accounts owned by fisc as of the acquisition date 
these assets  along with a million cash reserve account funded at closing  served as the collateral for the bridge facility 
the facility bore interest at vfcc s commercial paper rate plus percent and expired on august  under the terms of the facility  all cash collections from the receivables or cash distributions to the certificate holder under the securitizations were first applied to pay fisc a servicing fee in the amount of percent on the outstanding balance of all owned or managed receivables and then to pay interest on the facility 
excess cash flow available after servicing fees and interest payments was utilized to reduce the outstanding principal balance on the indebtedness 
in addition  one third of the servicing fee paid to fisc was also utilized to reduce principal outstanding on the indebtedness 
on august   the company entered into an agreement with wachovia securities to refinance the acquisition facility 
under the agreement  a partnership was created in which fifs acquisition serves as the general partner and contributed its assets for a percent interest in the partnership and first union investors  inc  an affiliate of wachovia securities  serves as the limited partner with a percent interest in the partnership the partnership 
pursuant to the refinancing  the partnership issued class a notes in the amount of  and class b notes in the amount of  to vfcc  the proceeds of which were used to retire the acquisition debt 
the class a notes bear interest at vfcc s commercial paper rate plus percent per annum and amortize on a monthly basis by an amount necessary to reduce the class a note balance as of the payment date to percent of the outstanding principal balance of receivables acquired for investment  excluding receivables acquired for investment that are applicable to fiacc  as of the previous month end 
the class b notes bear interest at vfcc s commercial paper rate plus percent per annum and amortize on a monthly basis by an amount which varied based on excess cash flows received from receivables acquired for investment after payment of servicing fees  trustee and back up servicer fees  class a note interest and class a note principal  plus collections received on the trust certificates 
the outstanding balance of the class a notes was  at april  the class b notes were paid in full on september  after the class b notes were paid in full  all cash flows received after payment of class a note principal and interest  servicing fees and other costs  are distributed to the partnership for subsequent distribution to the partners based upon the respective partnership interests 
during the nine months ended january    was distributed to the limited partner 
beginning in november  the partnership used excess cash flow to retire additional class a note principal thus no further partnership distributions were paid until the class a notes were retired 
on february   the class a notes were fully paid and all excess cash flows are paid to the partners 
the amount of the partners cash flow will vary depending on the timing and amount of cash flows from the assets 
for the year ended april    was distributed to the limited partner 
the company is accounting for wachovia securities limited partnership interest in the partnership as a minority interest 
working capital facility 
on december   the company entered into an agreement with wachovia securities to refinance the  outstanding balance of the working capital term loan previously provided by bank of america and wachovia and increase the size of the facility to million 
the renewal facility was provided to a special purpose  wholly owned subsidiary of the company  first investors residual funding lp 
the facility originally consisted of a million revolving tranche and a million term loan tranche which amortizes monthly 
the term loan tranche of this working capital facility will be evidenced by the class b notes issued in conjunction with the auto trust financing 
the remaining million of the million working capital facility revolves monthly in accordance with a borrowing base consisting of the overcollateralization amount and reserve accounts for each of the company s other credit facilities 
the facility is secured solely by the residual cash flow and cash reserve accounts related to the company s warehouse credit facilities  the acquisition facility and the existing and future term note facilities 
pricing under the facility is based on the libor rate plus plus another on the facility limit 
on december   the maturity of the facility was extended to december  under the terms of the renewal  the interest rate was increased to libor plus 
in addition  the monthly principal amortization under the term loan tranche was increased to the greater of  or the principal distributions made under the class b notes issued under the auto trust financing 
this amortization schedule will continue until the term loan tranche is repaid  leaving the remaining facility consisting of the million revolving tranche 
in the event that the facility is not renewed at maturity  residual cash flows from the various receivables financing transactions will be applied to amortize the debt over the remaining life of the underlying receivables 
at april  and  there was  and  respectively  outstanding under this facility 
the company presently intends to seek a renewal of the working capital facility from its lender prior to maturity 
should the facility not be renewed  the outstanding balance of the receivables would be amortized in accordance with the borrowing base 
management considers its relationship with its lenders to be satisfactory and has no reason to believe that this credit facility will not be renewed 
if the facility is not renewed  however  or if material changes are made to its terms and conditions  it could have a material adverse effect on the company 
shareholder loans on december  the company entered into an agreement with one of its shareholders who is a member of its board of directors under which the company may  from time to time  borrow up to million 
the proceeds of the borrowings will be utilized to fund certain private and open market purchases of the company s common stock pursuant to a stock repurchase plan authorized by the board of directors and for general corporate purposes 
borrowings under the facility bear interest at a fixed rate of percent per annum paid monthly 
the facility is unsecured and expressly subordinated to the company s senior credit facilities 
the facility matures on december  but may be repaid at any time unless the company is in default on one of its other credit facilities 
at april  and  there was  and  respectively  outstanding under this facility 
interest rate management 
the company s warehouse credit facilities bear interest at floating interest rates which are reset on a short term basis while the secured term notes bear interest at a fixed rate of interest 
the company s receivables bear interest at fixed rates that do not generally vary with a change in market interest rates 
since a primary contributor to the company s profitability is its ability to manage its net interest spread  the company seeks to maximize the net interest spread while minimizing exposure to changes in interest rates 
in connection with managing the net interest spread  the company may periodically enter into interest rate swaps or caps to minimize the effects of market interest rate fluctuations on the net interest spread 
to the extent that the company has outstanding floating rate borrowings or has elected to convert a portion of its borrowings from fixed rates to floating rates  the company will be exposed to fluctuations in short term interest rates 
in connection with the issuance of the a term notes  the company entered into a swap agreement with bank of america pursuant to which the company pays a floating rate equal to the prevailing one month libor rate plus percent and receives a fixed rate of percent from the counterparty 
the initial notional amount of the swap was  which amortized in accordance with the expected amortization of the term notes 
final maturity of the swap was august  on september   the company elected to terminate the aforementioned swap at no material gain or loss and enter into a new swap under which the company would pay a fixed rate of percent and receive the prevailing one month libor rate plus percent on a notional amount of million 
under the terms of the swap  the counterparty had the option of extending the swap for an additional three years to mature on april  at a fixed rate of percent 
on april   the counterparty exercised its extension option 
on june   the company entered into interest rate swaps with an aggregate notional amount of million and a maturity date of april  under the terms of these swaps  the company will pay a floating rate based on one month libor and receive a fixed rate of percent 
management elected to enter into these swap agreements to offset the uneconomical position of the existing pay fixed swap created by rapidly declining market interest rates 
during the year ended april  and as a requirement of the fiarc commercial paper facility  the company entered into nine interest rate cap transactions at cap rates ranging from to with an amortizing notional balance that is expected to coincide with the outstanding balance of the fiarc commercial paper facility 
the interest rate caps were not designated as hedges and  accordingly  changes in the fair value of the interest rate caps are recorded as unrealized gains or losses and reflected in net earnings 
hedge accounting was not adopted for these positions due to mark to market movements being deemed ineffective since they relate to time value and would be required to flow through net earnings thus eliminating any benefits of hedge accounting 
in connection with the repurchase of the alac securitization and the financing of that repurchase through the fiacc subsidiary on september   fiacc entered into an interest rate swap agreement with wachovia securities under which fiacc paid a fixed rate of percent as compared to the one month commercial paper index rate 
the initial notional amount of the swap was  which amortized monthly in accordance with the expected amortization of the fiacc borrowings 
the final maturity of the swap was december  on march   in connection with the repurchase of the alac securitization and the financing of that purchase through the fiacc subsidiary  the company and the counterparty modified the existing interest rate swap increasing the notional amount initially to  and reducing the fixed rate from percent to percent 
the new notional amount amortized monthly in accordance with the expected principal amortization of the underlying borrowings 
the expiration date of the swap was changed from december  to september  on october   in connection with the million acquisition facility  the company  through fifs acquisition  entered into a series of hedging instruments with wachovia securities designed to hedge floating rate borrowings under the acquisition facility against changes in market rates 
accordingly  the company entered into two interest rate swap agreements  the first in the initial notional amount of million class a swap pursuant to which the company s interest rate is fixed at percent  and  the second in the initial notional amount of million class b swap pursuant to which the company s interest rate was fixed at percent 
the notional amount outstanding under each swap agreement amortized based on an implied amortization of the hedged indebtedness 
the class a swap had a final maturity of december   while the class b swap matured on february  the company also purchased two interest rate caps  which protect the company and the lender against any material increases in interest rates that may adversely affect any outstanding indebtedness that is not fully covered by the aggregate notional amount outstanding under the swaps 
the first cap agreement class a cap enabled the company to receive payments from the counterparty in the event that the one month commercial paper rate exceeded percent on a notional amount that increased initially and then amortized based on the expected difference between the outstanding notional amount under class a swap and the underlying indebtedness 
the interest rate cap expired december  and the cost of the cap was amortized in interest expense for the period 
the second cap agreement class b cap enabled the company to receive payments from the counterparty in the event that the one month commercial paper rate exceeded percent on a notional amount that increased initially and then amortized based on the expected difference between the outstanding notional amount under class b swap and the underlying indebtedness 
the interest rate cap expired december  and the cost of the cap was imbedded in the fixed rate applicable to class b swap 
pursuant to the refinance of the acquisition facility on august   the class b cap was terminated and the notional amounts of the class a swap and class a cap were adjusted downward to reflect the lower outstanding balance of the class a notes 
the amendment or cancellation of these instruments resulted in a gain of  this derivative net gain was amortized over the life of the initial derivative instrument 
in addition  the two remaining hedge instruments were assigned by fifs acquisition to the partnership 
as of may  the company designated its interest rate swaps and an interest rate cap with an aggregate notional value of  as cash flow hedges as defined under sfas no 
accordingly  any changes in the fair value of these instruments resulting from the mark to market process are recorded as unrealized gains or losses and reflected as an increase or reduction in shareholders equity through other accumulated comprehensive income loss 
in connection with the decision to enter into the million floating rate swap on june   the company elected to change the designation of the million fixed rate swap and not account for the instrument as a hedge under sfas no 
as a result  the change in fair value of the swaps is reflected in net earnings for the period subsequent to may  the interest rate caps entered into as a requirement of the fiarc commercial paper facility are not designated as hedges and  accordingly  changes in the fair value are recorded as unrealized gains or losses and reflected in net earnings 
hedge accounting was not adopted for these positions due to mark to market movements being deemed ineffective since they relate to time value and would be required to flow through net earnings thus eliminating any benefits of hedge accounting 
delinquency and credit loss experience the company s results of operations  financial condition and liquidity may be adversely affected by nonperforming receivables 
the company seeks to manage its risk of credit loss through i prudent credit evaluations  ii risk management activities  iii effective collection procedures  and iv by maximizing recoveries on defaulted loans 
the allowance for credit losses of  as of april  and  as of april  as a percentage of receivables held for investment of  as of april  and  as of april  was percent 
with respect to receivables acquired for investment  the company has established a nonaccretable difference which represents the excess of the loan s scheduled contractual principal and interest payments over its expected cash flows 
as of april  and april   the nonaccretable difference as a percentage of receivables acquired for investment was and  respectively 
the decrease as of april  is primarily related to the liquidating nature of the portfolio and that the loans are well seasoned 
for the april  period  an additional reserve was provided by the third quarter write down of million related to increasing the cumulative loss rate in the cash flow projections 
this write down occurred due to higher severity and frequency of losses realized to date and to reserve for higher expected potential losses 
the company also reclassifies accretable yield and nonaccretable difference as assumptions are updated 
for the year ending april   the decrease in accretable yield is due to a slightly higher cumulative loss assumption 
for the year ended april   the increase in accretable yield is primarily due to increasing the expected term of the remaining cash flow in order to allow for collections on charged off receivables 
by extending the cash flow projection model life  accretable yield must be increased to provide for future income 
the company considers a loan to be delinquent when the borrower fails to make a scheduled payment of principal and interest 
accrual of interest is suspended when the payment from the borrower is over days past due 
generally  repossession procedures are initiated to days after the payment default 
the company retains the credit risk associated with the receivables acquired 
the company purchases credit enhancement insurance from third party insurers which covers the risk of loss upon default and certain other risks 
until march  such insurance absorbed substantially all credit losses 
in april  the company established a captive insurance subsidiary to reinsure certain risks under the credit enhancement insurance coverage for all receivables acquired in march and thereafter 
in addition  receivables financed under the auto trust  fiarc and fiacc commercial paper facilities do not carry default insurance 
provisions for credit losses of  and  have been recorded for the twelve months ended april  and april   respectively 
the company calculates the allowance for credit losses in accordance with sfas  accounting for contingencies 
sfas  accounting for creditors for impairment of a loan  does not apply to the company since the receivables held for investment are comprised of a large group of smaller balance homogenous loans that are evaluated collectively for impairment 
the company applies a systematic methodology in order to determine the amount of the allowance for credit losses 
the specific methodology utilized is a six month migration analysis whereby the company compares the aging status of each loan from six months prior to the aging loan status as of the reporting date 
these factors are then applied to the aging status of each loan at the reporting date in order to calculate the number of loans that are expected to migrate to impaired status 
the estimated number of impairments is then multiplied by estimated loss per loan  which is based on historical information 
the computed reserve is then compared to the amount recorded for adequacy 
the company compares the six month result to prior six month periods to compare trends and evaluate any other internal or external factors that may affect collectibility 
the allowance for credit losses is based on estimates and qualitative evaluations and ultimate losses will vary from current estimates 
these estimates are reviewed periodically and as adjustments  either positive or negative  become necessary  are reported in earnings in the period they become known 
for receivables acquired for investment  nonaccretable difference represents the excess of the loan s scheduled contractual principal and interest payments over its expected cash flows 
the company analyzes the composition of these liquidating portfolios in order to estimate a future loss rate 
criteria evaluated include delinquencies  historical charge offs  recovery rates  portfolio seasoning and economic conditions 
a cash flow model that considers term  interest rate  loss rate  prepayment rate and recovery rate is consistently applied to project expected cash flows 
the difference between expected cash flows and total contractual principal and interest payments is the nonaccretable difference 
for the year ended april   the company increased the cumulative loss rate by basis points from which was partially offset by higher expected recovery collections 
during the third quarter of the year ended april   the company increased the cumulative loss rate on the portfolio by basis points from the total increase to nonaccretable difference of  relates to the recessionary environment and the impact it has on customers ability to maintain comparable paying employment 
additionally  the effective decrease in prices of new automobiles through incentive programs offered by captives contributed to decreasing prices and demands for used vehicles 
this results in lower recovery rates realized through repossessions 
the collateral comprising the receivables acquired for investment is at higher risk as it is primarily older model used cars with higher mileage 
the increase in accretable yield results from increasing the expected term of the remaining cash flow in order to allow for collections on charged off receivables 
by extending the cash flow projection model life  accretable yield must be increased to provide for future income 
the following table sets forth certain information regarding the company s delinquency and charge off experience over its last two fiscal years dollars in thousands as of or for the year ended april  number of loans amount number of loans amount receivables held for investment delinquent amount outstanding days   days   days or more   total delinquencies   total delinquencies as a percentage of outstanding receivables net charge offs as a percentage of average receivables outstanding during the period the higher annualized charge off rate results from a higher number of repossessions coupled with lower recovery rates on the repossessed collateral which is due to continued economic weakness and a poor market for used vehicles

market risk the market risk discussion and the estimated amounts generated from the analysis that follows are forward looking statements of market risk assuming certain adverse market conditions occur 
actual results in the future may differ materially due to changes in the company s product and debt mix  developments in the financial markets  and further utilization by the company of risk mitigating strategies such as hedging 
the company s operating revenues are derived almost entirely from the collection of interest on the receivables it retains and its primary expense is the interest that it pays on borrowings incurred to purchase and retain such receivables 
the company s credit facilities bear interest at floating rates which are reset on a short term basis  whereas its receivables bear interest at fixed rates which do not generally vary with changes in interest rates 
the company is therefore exposed primarily to market risks associated with movements in interest rates on its credit facilities 
the company believes that it takes the necessary steps to appropriately reduce the potential impact of interest rate increases on the company s financial position and operating performance 
the company relies almost exclusively on revolving credit facilities to fund its origination of receivables 
periodically  the company will transfer receivables from a revolving to a term credit facility 
currently all of the company s credit facilities in combination with various swaps bear interest at floating rates tied to either a commercial paper index or libor 
as of april   the company had million of floating rate secured debt outstanding 
the company is exposed to interest rate movements until interest rates equal 
the company has interest rate cap agreements as protection for rate movements beyond on million of notional balance 
for every percent increase in commercial paper rates or libor up to  annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately  assuming the company maintains a level amount of floating rate debt and assuming an immediate increase in rates 
for every percent increase in commercial paper rates or libor over  annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately  assuming the company maintains a level amount of floating rate debt and assuming an immediate increase in rates 
as of april   the company had million of floating rate secured debt outstanding net of swap and cap agreements 
for every percent increase in commercial paper rates or libor  annual after tax earnings would decrease by approximately  assuming the company maintains a level amount of floating rate debt and assuming an immediate increase in rates
