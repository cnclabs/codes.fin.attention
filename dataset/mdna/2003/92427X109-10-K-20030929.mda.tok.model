in connection with the two loan facilities with banknorth  na  the company amended the lease agreement with its lessor in the sale leaseback transaction involving its factory headquarters in shelburne  vt to incorporate the terms of lessor s refinancing of the building at a lower interest rate 
under the lease amendment  the lessor agreed to pass along interest savings by way of reduced rent payments under the lease agreement with the company

the following is a summary of the company s contractual commitments and other obligations as of june  the company s other long term obligations are comprised of employment contracts and certain consulting arrangements 
fiscal year long term debt capital lease obligations operating leases other long term obligations total thereafter less amounts representing interest total contingencies on october   the company entered into a ten year lease for  square feet on madison avenue in new york city 
on december   the company s madison avenue location was closed due to structural problems at neighboring madison avenue 
on december  the company announced that it was permanently closing that retail location 
the city of new york deemed the madison avenue building uninhabitable from december  to april   and the company has not made any rent payments on the lease since december  on december   the company received a notice from its landlord of madison avenue alleging that it was in default under the lease for failure to resume occupancy  and demand for back rent for the period july  to december  in the amount of  further on january  the company received a demand to resume rent payments beginning january the company disputed the landlord s position and believed it was not obliga ted to resume occupancy or pay rent under the lease 
as a result  on may   the company commenced action in the supreme court of the state of new york  county of new york against madison realty company 
the action sought breach of contract damages and a declaration that the contract at issue  the former lease between the parties  has been terminated 
the landlord moved to dismiss the action based on purported documentary evidence  being the lease itself 
that motion was denied by order entered april  after having unsuccessfully attempted to resolve the disputes and after engaging in document discovery  the company moved for summary judgment on its claims and dismissal of the landlord s claims 
that motion was granted by order dated july  and judgment was entered in favor of the company and against the landlord in the amount of  on august  the landlord filed an appeal of that judgment and  as settlement discussions were unsuccessful  posted a bond to stay e nforcement of the judgment pending its appeal  which was argued on november  that judgment was affirmed by a vote of new york s appellate division  first department 
based on the two dissenting votes  the landlord has a right of appeal to new york s court of appeals  which is presently being briefed and will likely be argued in early the company has accrued management s estimated cost of  to settle this contingency  but no assurance can be given that this dispute can be settled for this amount 
in the event that no settlement is reached and the judgment is ultimately reversed on appeal and the company is not successful in its suit against madison realty company  the remaining amount owed under the lease over its remaining term at face value is  critical accounting policies the preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and assumptions about future events that affect the amounts reported in the financial statements and accompanying notes 
future events and their impact cannot be determined with absolute certainty 
therefore  the determination of estimates requires the exercise of judgement 
actual results inevitably will differ from those estimates  and such differences may be material to the financial statements 
we believe application of accounting policies  and the estimates inherently required therein  are reasonable 
these accounting policies and estimates are constantly reevaluated  and adjustments are made when facts and circumstances dictate a change 
we have identified certain critical accounting policies  which are described below inventory valuation the company carries its inventory at the lower of cost or market on a first in  first out basis 
the company makes certain assumptions to adjust inventory based on historical experience and current information in order to assess that inventory is recorded properly at the lower of cost or market 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional inventory adjustments may be required 
these adjustments can have a significant impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
providing for litigation contingencies the company is involved in litigation incidental to its business  the disposition of which is expected to have no material effect on the company s financial position or results of operations 
it is possible  however  that future results of operations for any particular quarterly or annual period could be materially affected by differences between the company s assumptions related to these proceedings and actual results 
the company accrues its best estimate of the probable cost for the resolution of legal claims 
such estimates are developed in consultation with outside counsel handling these matters and are based upon a combination of litigation and settlement strategies 
to the extent additional information arises  it is possible that the company s estimate of its liability  if any  in these matters may change 
returns and allowances provision the company accrues a provision for returns and allowances 
the company makes certain assumptions to adjust this provision based on historical experience and current information in order to assess that the provision is estimated properly 
if actual market conditions are less favorable than those projected by management  additional adjustments to the provision may be required 
these adjustments can have a significant impact on current and future operating results and financial position 
income tax provision the company provides for income taxes at rates equal to our combined federal and state effective rates  however  certain estimates are made based on historical experience and various other assumptions that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances 
subsequent revisions to the estimated net realizable value of deferred tax assets  deferred tax liabilities and other income tax liabilities could cause our provision for income taxes to vary significantly from period to period 
recent accounting pronouncements in january  the fasb issued fin  consolidation of variable interest entities 
fin requires that the criteria for consolidations be based upon analysis of risks and rewards  not control  and represents a significant and complex modification of previous accounting principles 
fin represents an accounting change  not a change in the underlying economics of asset sales 
fin is effective for consolidated financial statements issued after june  the company is in the process of determining the impact that the adoption of fin will have on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
in may  the fasb issued sfas no 
 accounting for certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
is the first phase of the fasb s project on liabilities and equity 
sfas no 
provides guidance on how an entity classifies and measures certain financial instruments with characteristics of both liabilities and equity 
many of these instruments were previously classified as equity 
sfas no 
is effective for financial instruments entered into or modified after may  sfas no 
requires companies to record the cumulative effect of financial instruments existing at the adoption date 
the company will adopt the provisions of sfas no 
on july  the adoption of this statement is not expected to have a material effect on the company s financial position  results of operations or cash flows 
related party transactions included in notes receivable at june  is a recourse demand note from elisabeth robert  a director and chief executive officer of the company to finance certain income tax obligations related to her exercise of stock options 
the loan balance which was  and  as of june  and  respectively is being repaid in weekly amounts of principal and interest through payroll deductions such that the entire amount will be paid by the end of the term of ms 
robert s employment agreement with the company dated november  the interest rate on the note is a floating rate equal to the applicable federal rate on short term borrowings as defined by section a of the internal revenue code and the note is secured by a stock pledge agreement from ms 
robert 
item a 
quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk the company s earnings and cash flows are subject to fluctuations due to changes in interest rates primarily from its investment of available cash balances in money market funds 
under its current policies  the company does not use interest rate derivative instruments to manage exposure to interest rate changes 
a ten percent fluctuation in interest rates would not have a material impact on the company s ability to meet its financial obligations
