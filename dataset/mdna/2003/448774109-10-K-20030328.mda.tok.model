item management s discussion and analysis of financial condition and results of operations the following discussion of hydril s historical results of operations and financial condition should be read in conjunction with hydril s consolidated financial statements and notes thereto included elsewhere in this report 
overview we are engaged worldwide in engineering  manufacturing and marketing premium connections and pressure control products used for oil and gas drilling and production 
our premium connection products are marketed primarily to exploration and production company operators 
we sell our pressure control products primarily to drilling contractors 
drilling contractors purchase pressure control capital equipment products and aftermarket replacement parts for use in oil and gas drilling and production 
demand for our products and services is cyclical and substantially dependent on the activity levels in the oil and gas industry and our customers willingness to spend capital on the exploration and development of oil and gas reserves 
the level of these capital expenditures is highly sensitive to current and expected oil and gas prices  which have historically been characterized by significant volatility 
while it has not been the case recently  generally increasing commodity prices result in increased oil and gas exploration and production  which translates into greater demand for oilfield products and services 
conversely  falling commodity prices generally result in reduced demand for oilfield products and services 
historically  changes in budgets and activity levels by oil and gas exploration and production companies have lagged significant movements in oil and gas prices 
sales of premium connection products are driven by the level of worldwide drilling activity  in particular the number of rigs drilling at target depths greater than  feet and the number of rigs drilling in water depths greater than  feet 
the main factors that affect sales of pressure control capital equipment products are the level of construction of new drilling rigs and the rate at which existing rigs are refurbished 
demand for our aftermarket replacement parts  repair and field services is driven primarily by the level of worldwide offshore drilling activity 
beginning in mid  the price of oil increased significantly due to opec member countries reducing production and recovering worldwide demand for oil 
in addition  gas prices increased significantly during this period and peaked in late as a result of low levels of gas storage in the united states 
these higher prices triggered a substantial increase in the number of rigs drilling for oil and gas in the united states and canada 
the average weekly rig count for the united states and canada combined for  as measured by baker hughes  increased over the average weekly rig count for rig counts continued to improve during the first half of with the combined rig count for the united states and canada peaking in july of these improvements in market fundamentals stimulated an increase in the demand for our products in the united states and canada  in particular premium connection products and pressure control aftermarket replacement parts 
in response to this increase in demand  we completed a expansion of our premium connection capacity at our plant in nisku  canada in january  and increased capacity in the united states by during and however  beginning mid  commodity prices started to fall  particularly natural gas prices  which fell sharply  and averaged mm btu henry hub in the fourth quarter of  down from the first quarter 
west texas intermediate crude oil prices declined as well from an average of per barrel in the first quarter of to an average of per barrel in the fourth quarter  down 
this decline in commodity prices led to a decline in drilling in the united states and canada  in particular in the number of rigs drilling in deep formations for natural gas in north america 
the rig counts in the united states and canada combined  as measured by baker hughes  fell from july to december this decrease included a reduction in the number of rigs drilling over  feet and the number of rigs in water depths greater than  feet 
as a result  in the fourth quarter of we began to experience a decline in demand for premium connections and late in that quarter  a significant decrease in plant utilization in the united states 
accordingly  we reduced our premium connection workforce at our manufacturing facilities in the united states by approximately in january during  commodity prices began to recover from their levels in the fourth quarter of from the fourth quarter of to the fourth quarter of  us natural gas prices increased and us crude oil prices rose 
however  the commodity price recovery  which in part was fueled by global uncertainties over a war with iraq and political unrest and a labor strike in venezuela  was accompanied by a decrease in drilling activity 
for  several factors contributed to the decrease in spending by oil and gas companies for oil and gas exploration and development in the united states despite increasing commodity prices 
first  the downturn in the us economy during resulted in reduced capital spending by our customers 
these conservative spending practices focused on balance sheet improvements  primarily paying down debt  rather than spending for exploration and production 
in addition  the uncertainty of global events  most significantly the possibility of a war with iraq  led to less spending 
the average deep formation rig count in the united states rigs drilling to a depth over  feet for the year declined from  the average united states and canada combined rig count  as measured by baker hughes  decreased from and the number of rigs drilling in water depths greater than  feet declined 
as a result of these reduced rig counts  demand for premium connections and aftermarket parts and service decreased in the united states and canada in generally  our international premium connection business has not been impacted by the decline in rig counts experienced in north america during and our international business typically has longer lead times than our north america business  generally three to six months 
the average monthly rig count outside of the united states and canada for was compared to for  a decrease of 
the rig count was up compared to demand in the industry for new pressure control capital equipment was not as strong during the period of through as compared to demand for aftermarket replacement parts  due to the low level of rig construction and refurbishment worldwide 
however  in august  our pressure control segment received an order for a blowout preventer multiplex control system  which was delivered in august in march  our pressure control segment received a million order for four offshore drilling blowout prevention and control systems from globalsantafe corporation 
additionally during we received two orders from a subsidiary of diamond offshore drilling  inc for blowout preventer multiplex control systems 
during  we benefited from these orders as revenue and gross profit was recognized using the percentage of completion accounting method and significant progress was made during the year 
several systems were completed during and delivery of the remaining systems is expected during revenue with the exception of revenue from pressure control long term projects  we record revenue for all products and services at the time such products are delivered or services are provided 
in  of our revenue was recorded on this basis 
for our pressure control long term projects which are generally contracts from six to eighteen months in duration and an estimated contract price in excess of million  we recognize revenue using the percentage of completion method  measured by the percentage of cost incurred to estimated final cost 
we use this method because we consider expended contract costs to be the best available measure of progress on these contracts 
if a long term contract was anticipated to have an estimated loss  such loss would be recognized in the period in which the loss becomes apparent 
gross profit our gross profit is the difference between our revenue and our cost of sales 
cost of sales for our products include purchased raw materials and components  manufacturing labor  plant overhead expenses  a portion of engineering expenses  and building and equipment depreciation 
some of the costs are fixed cost and cause our margins to suffer when demand is low and manufacturing capacity is underutilized 
also included in cost of sales are the costs of product warranty  product liability insurance and last in  first out inventory valuation adjustments 
we do not take title to the tubulars we thread for the united states and canadian market  and therefore  own no inventories of tubulars for sales in these countries 
however  we purchase tubulars for fulfilling a portion of our existing orders outside of the united states and canada  which is generally less than of our total revenue 
for our pressure control products  we have inventory for existing orders in process as well as a replacement parts inventory both internationally and domestically 
a majority of our inventory is for our pressure control segment 
selling  general and administration expenses our selling  general and administration expenses include engineering expenses that relate to research  product design  development and maintenance  as well as sales and marketing expenses  which consist mostly of personnel and related expenses  and commissions paid to third party agents selling our products 
also included are general and administration expenses that relate to accounting  treasury  information technology  human resources  legal expenses and corporate overhead 
operating income loss our operating income loss is gross profit less selling  general and administration expenses 
operating income loss is comprised of the operating income of each of our premium connection and pressure control segments and the portion of selling  general and administration expenses  referred to as corporate administration  which is not allocated to either segment 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue total revenue increased million  or  to million for from million in premium connection revenue decreased to million and pressure control revenue increased to million 
the decrease in premium connection revenue was primarily the result of decreased demand for our products and services as a result of decreased drilling activity in our north american united states and canada markets 
this decrease was partially offset by higher revenue from our international premium connections as a result of strong demand in our niche markets 
the increase in pressure control revenue was attributable to a increase in revenue from capital equipment due to an increase in percentage of completion accounting method revenue from project orders received during and this increase was partially offset by an decrease in aftermarket replacement parts revenue due to lower worldwide offshore drilling rig activity and declines in the united states rig count 
gross profit gross profit increased million to million for from million in the increase was primarily due to increased efficiencies in our premium connection plants and a product mix shift in our premium connection segment to higher margin products  partially offset by lower margins in the pressure control segment resulting from the increase in capital equipment revenue and the decrease in aftermarket replacement parts sales 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for compared to million for the increase was due to higher engineering costs to support research and development activities  engineering design expenses to support the higher pressure control capital equipment project backlog during the year  a full year of subsea mudlift drilling expenses related to advancing and commercializing the technology and higher sales and marketing expenses to support international markets 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses increased from for to for operating income operating income increased million to million for  compared to million for operating income for our premium connection segment increased to million for compared to million for operating income for our pressure control segment decreased million  or  from million for to million for corporate and administration expenses were million for compared to million in interest expense interest expense increased million to million for from million for the increase was the result of a million make whole premium on our prepayment of million of our senior unsecured notes in august  which was partially offset by lower interest expense for the remainder of the year 
other expense other expense was million for compared to million for other expense for included million to maintain surplus real estate and facilities not used in operations  which was partially offset by miscellaneous income items 
other expense for included million in expenses incurred in facilitating the offering of common stock by certain of our stockholders in the second quarter of and million to maintain surplus real estate and facilities not used in operations 
for further information on these transactions  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
results of operations for the years ended december  and revenue total revenue increased million  or  to million for from million in premium connection revenue rose to million and pressure control revenue increased to million 
the increase in premium connection revenue was primarily the result of increased demand for our products as a result of higher rig counts in both our north american united states and canada and international markets  and our expansion of plant capacity in north america to accommodate the higher demand 
the increase in pressure control revenue was attributable to a increase in revenue from the sale of aftermarket replacement parts due to higher worldwide rig activity  and an increase in revenue from the sale of capital equipment due to an increase in project orders received during gross profit gross profit increased million to million for from million in the increase was primarily due to an increase in revenue from pressure control aftermarket replacement parts that generate higher margins  increased utilization of our premium connection plants in north america  increased profitability of our pressure control capital equipment business and higher prices in both of our segments 
selling  general and administrative expenses selling  general and administrative expenses increased million to million for compared to million for the increase was due to higher engineering costs to support capital equipment orders  an increase in sales agent commissions and sales expenses as a result of increased demand for our products  and higher management incentive accruals resulting from improved performance 
as a percentage of sales  selling  general and administrative expenses decreased from for to for operating income operating income increased million to million for  compared to million for operating income for our premium connection segment increased to million for compared to operating income for our pressure control segment increased million to million for from million for corporate and administration expenses were million for compared to million in interest expense interest expense decreased million from million for to million for due to lower outstanding debt in other income and expense for  other expense was million  which included million in expenses incurred in facilitating the offering of common stock by certain of our stockholders in the second quarter of and million to maintain surplus real estate and facilities not used in operations 
for  other income was million  which includes a million gain from a legal settlement related to the purchase of put options to sell marketable securities  and a million gain recorded from the sale of real estate not used in operations 
for further information on these transactions  see note in the notes to consolidated financial statements 
liquidity and capital resources our primary liquidity needs are to repay indebtedness  fund capital expenditures  fund new product development and to provide additional working capital 
our primary source of funds is cash flow from operations 
in addition  we have available million in revolving credit facilities 
operating activities cash provided by operating activities was million for and million for cash provided by operations in was primarily from earnings  contractual cash payments received from customers for progress made on capital equipment long term projects and utilization of deferred tax assets  the effects of which were partially offset by higher working capital requirements 
the decrease in cash provided by operations in of million as compared to was primarily due to the expenditure of contractual cash payments from customers received in for completion of large project orders 
cash provided by operations in was million higher than in primarily due to improved operating results in both of our segments driven by higher revenue and contractual cash payments from customers on project orders in backlog 
investing activities net cash used in investing activities for was million compared to million for the investment of cash in was attributable to capital spending and investments in held to maturity securities  while the investment of cash in was solely for capital expenditures 
net cash used in investing activities for was million higher than the increase was due to higher capital spending and one time cash receipts in these one time cash receipts included a may settlement payment from a dispute with a financial institution related to our purchase of put options on marketable securities 
as a result of this settlement  we received  after expenses  approximately million 
additionally  in july  we sold certain real property not used in our operations for proceeds of approximately million  net of expenses from the sale 
for more information on capital expenditures for the three years ended december  see capital expenditures below 
credit facilities we have two unsecured revolving lines of credit for working capital requirements that provide up to million in total committed revolving credit borrowings through june  of these  million relates to our us operations and million relates to our foreign operations 
under these lines  we may borrow  at our election  at either a prime or libor based interest rate 
interest rates under the us facility fluctuate depending on our leverage ratio and are libor plus a spread ranging from to basis points or prime 
interest rates under the foreign credit line fluctuate depending on the company s leverage ratio and are prime plus a spread ranging from zero to basis points or libor plus a spread ranging from to basis points 
at december   there were no outstanding borrowings under either facility 
our us revolving credit agreement contains covenants with respect to debt levels  tangible net worth  debt to capitalization and interest coverage ratios 
at december   we were in compliance with these covenants 
our foreign line of credit does not contain any separate financial covenants but contains cross default provisions which would be triggered by a default under our us line of credit 
the terms of the company s credit facilities allows for the issuance of letters of credit 
the amount of outstanding letters of credit reduces the amount available for borrowing under the credit facilities 
the letters of credit are generally short in duration and immaterial in amount 
at december  there was approximately million outstanding in letters of credit 
on march   the company s domestic and foreign lines of credit were extended to mature on june  contractual cash obligations the following paragraph summarizes the company s contractual cash obligations as of december  payment due by period total in millions short term debt operating leases total other indebtedness in a june private placement  we issued million aggregate principal amount of senior secured notes due june  during  the senior notes became unsecured 
the senior notes may not be prepaid prior to maturity unless we pay the noteholders a make whole premium based on prevailing market interest rates 
during the third quarter of  the company formally notified the noteholders of its intent to prepay million aggregate principal amount of the unsecured notes 
on august   this payment was made plus a make whole premium of million 
the make whole premium was included as interest expense in the consolidated statement of operations 
if the remaining million were prepaid prior to june   an additional make whole premium would be required  which as of december  would be million 
we anticipate having cash available at june  to pay the balance of this obligation at maturity  however  depending on the facts and circumstances at the time  we may choose to refinance all or a portion of the remaining notes 
the agreement under which the notes are outstanding requires us to maintain a minimum level of tangible net worth 
additional financial tests  if not passed  restrict our ability to incur additional indebtedness and make acquisitions  investments and restricted payments  such as pay dividends and repurchase capital stock 
at december   we were in compliance with these financial requirements 
a change in control would allow the holders to require prepayment of some or all of the notes at of their principal amount plus a make whole premium based on prevailing market interest rates 
technology the joint industry project to develop dual gradient drilling technology successfully drilled a test well in the gulf of mexico in the fourth quarter of the joint industry project team completed its work  and during  hydril continued to refine the design of the equipment and pursue commercialization through its wholly owned subsidiary  subsea mudlift drilling company  llc 
expenditures to commercialize this technology were expensed in and were less than of total selling  general and administrative expenses 
capital expenditures capital expenditures for were million  which included million in our premium connection segment of which million related to plant capacity expansion and million related to support of manufacturing operations 
also included was million in our pressure control segment  of which million was used to replace and refurbish machine tools and to construct a new deepwater assembly building for blowout preventer stack assembly at our houston plant and million was used to support engineering research and development and manufacturing operations 
capital expenditures for general corporate purposes were million for capital expenditures for were million  which consisted of million for our premium connection business  primarily related to the expansion of manufacturing capacity in north america  million for our pressure control segment  primarily for the replacement and upgrade of manufacturing machine tools  and million for general corporate purposes 
capital expenditures for were million  which consisted of million for our premium connection business  primarily related to manufacturing capacity expansion in north america  million for our pressure control segment  primarily for manufacturing support  and million for general corporate purposes 
if current industry conditions continue  we expect our capital expenditures to be approximately to million primarily to support manufacturing operations and engineering  research and development activities 
dividends we have no plans to declare or pay any dividends on our common stock or our class b common stock for the foreseeable future 
backlog pressure control capital equipment backlog which includes orders for capital equipment and long term projects  at december  and was million and million  respectively 
the decrease was the result of work completed and revenue recognized on several large long term capital equipment project orders that were received in we recognize the revenue and gross profit from pressure control long term projects using the percentage of completion accounting method  and the remaining revenue from projects currently in backlog is expected to be recorded during as revenue is recognized under the percentage of completion method  the order value in backlog is reduced 
it is possible for orders to be cancelled  however  in the event of cancellations all costs incurred would be billable to the customer 
our backlog of premium connection and pressure control aftermarket parts and service are not a meaningful measure of business prospects due to the quick turnover of such orders 
tax matters as of december   we had deferred tax assets  net of deferred tax liabilities  of million  which includes foreign tax credits of approximately million 
these assets are benefits to us as long as we expect to have sufficient future income in the united states 
the foreign tax credits are available through the year to reduce future united states income taxes payable 
management projections indicate that sufficient income will be generated in future years to realize the tax assets  and therefore  no valuation allowance was required
